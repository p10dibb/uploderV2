For a first timer, he answered all of many questions and wanted to make sure I was completely comfortable before moving forward.  I appreciated his professionalism and his extensive knowledge.  I am so happy I found such a wonderful practice.  After my first visit, I am feeling like a new man.  I wish I would have had the courage to visit sooner.  Thank you, Dr. Ali.<13<12<2019<2<38<39

Windows are gorgeous and the interior wood laminate matches my existing 60-year-old real-wood trim perfectly. Appreciated Joe`s suggestions on ways to keep costs in check and on window choices that would fit the house`s style. I had dining room, all of living room and 3 bedrooms replaced. Took 5 weeks from initial call until full installation! Thanks, Jordan Exteriors!<13<12<2019<15<38<58
zxbhnoeXLoX2_rUHQFq-GQ<Hk3MRzw-0Xsupnjg4559jQ<2gG20Zn5RWo_HE33pP2MJQ<2<1<1<0<the customer service here is so bad. They stare at you in a rude way when you come in, which made me feel really uncomfortable. And then, when i checked out, they talked to themselves instead of talking to me, bragging about how many credit cards she got for the day, which made the whole experience so awkward. She also handed me the bag in an aggressive manner.   This really needs to be addressed, the workers have zero grasp on good customer service.  For the managers, I came in on March 11th at around 4:30 pm. There was a girl and a guy working at the front.  You need to fix this.<11<3<2019<23<55<57
qh3j1sLnpfnJ4RQsqr5Cww<54OrptZyEPK_c7YPLHHnAQ<utIA0LyQmwP-9DRyxUe6qQ<1<0<0<0<"I came to your restaurant this morning at approximately 6:55 am on 10/23/19. I placed a take out order for an omelet with no toast or potato`s and a side of sausage. I told the hostess that I would sit at the round table immediately by the front door. I sat down and read my book waiting on my order. At 7:25 I went back to the front desk just a few feet away and asked about my order. Now a different young woman was at the desk and said '"Here it is on the shelf'" next to the front.   I sat there waiting 30 minutes for an order that should have taken no more than 10-15 minutes to prepare and have ready. Her response was '"I didn`t know it was for you.'" I told the initial order taker where I was waiting for my order and no one apparently passed that on. Also in sitting there with no water, no order of a meal in front of me for 30 minutes and no one was curious why I was sitting there? For my health? Apparently not.  Now, my food is cold and completely unacceptable because there was NO follow up in your restaurant.There are far too many breakfast options in your neighborhood that I will now give my business too - Over Easy and Scramble being just two. I go out for breakfast three to four mornings every week spending  on average $250 every month and you have lost my business for good."<23<10<2019<15<20<14
nALGyi0FfRiTm2RI-rzt2w<aTuTHbNGgLv9FYjfZHWt1Q<-ZBfr1BHvArFp1d6XH8jOQ<5<3<1<3<Talk about a hole in the wall! Rocket Burger & Subs throws down some hot burgers and sandwiches, but what separates them from the rest is their wide array of classic sodas! You walk into a wall full of old fashioned pop and some childhood classics that bring you back. There`s no better way to wash down a great burger and fries! I chose a rootbeer that had the coolest design and it was super yummy and bubbly! The burgers are great and HUGE! So you will get full even off of a single patty burger. Fries are crisp and seasoned :)  The service is fantastic as well! Try it out!<3<12<2019<2<20<2
7h2i-WQ7Zkbv-PL9dWjQlQ<Ezo58Z8ED6Q1rkwUZOKZyw<bm_PGQMGMjylitqkNIEzTw<1<1<1<1<What happened to Vivace? We hadn`t been in a while and as soon as we walked in we knew something was up. It took 3 hostesses to figure out where to seat us in an empty restaurant. Once we sat down we noticed how dirty the place was and we were some of the first people there. We thought about leaving but decided to stay, we should have left. The food came quickly and after a few bites we stopped eating. The shrimp and grits were bland and wasn`t made according to the description. The mushroom frittata looked like a dish sponge and tasted worse. We wished we had gone to Bojangles like the servers did as we watched them eat theirs at the end of the bar. I feel like I remember this place being a really good restaurant with great food and good atmosphere. What happened?? Also those same three hostesses said nothing as we walked past them on the way out. I hate spending my money in a place where it seems like everyone is doing the bare minimum to get by but charging you like they`re doing the most.<30<11<2019<18<1<45
ba7SqwZyz0fPwOiGg8692A<8C8Ml7hj1zxyhcChk1TESQ<L-Yj3Y1bYKTSg4uE9KTVBw<5<4<1<3<"To celebrate the honour of getting the Elite Badge, my 100th Yelp will review my family`s recent favourite place. Basically we eat their barbecue once a week since we discovered this place.   Adamson Barbecue is known for authentic Texas barbecue and crazy lineup on Saturdays. Since it is close to my hubby`s workplace, we could take the advantage of getting the take-out on weekdays.   Finally, I visited the place in person on my day off. I got there just right after 11am and people started going in.  The excitement started when you saw platters of beautiful meats people ordered and I was eager to try all the varieties. I was greeted by the friendly owner with a big smile and he gave out sample of their famous brisket to try. All platters come with pickles, raw onions and slices of bread. Since we love their brisket and ribs, I ordered them by pound. If you cannot make up your mind, just go for their suggested platters - '"Texas Trinity'" or '"Everything Tray'" to sample their best selections.   The meats were so freshly cooked and I could see smokes coming out. The smoked flavour was so nice, and Texas style uses mainly black pepper and salt to cook the meat so I could still taste the meat flavour itself. Meat texture is very tender and juicy. Love the fat proportion of the brisket and it creates the melt in your mouth experience. The onion tastes so delicious and sweetness enhance the meat flavour. The ribs is my hubby`s favourite; the meat is very tender yet still attaches to the bone. The soft bone is so yummy.   They offer three kinds of side and my favourite is the coleslaw. I have tried the beans, but I guess I get used to the mushy style, so I find it was a little '"hard'". However, the firmer one seems to be the authentic way based on other Yelpers.   I am eager to eat at Adamson again to try their pulled pork, turkey, chicken, desserts.....   If you don`t wanna wait in line, just pre-order the meat (over $100) and share with a lot of friends. There is a separate area for pre-order pickup."<9<3<2017<16<12<2

gk-cLVgeq4sHwgXli9B5nw<0nra0XnE9DNUgTPzEgyWxA<M6A1VQEK0OOVEp6UbO9INg<5<2<1<1<I`ve been to probably 5 different tattoo artists over time, and I had my doubts about Club Tattoo. I heard it was expensive, the staff was rude, and the artsits were overpaid. Well, after visiting nearly half-a-dozen tattoo artists through my life I can honestly say that this particular location was amazing! They were professional, which is far more than I can say for any other parlor, including Urban Art.   My tattoo artist - Eric Stratton - is one of the most professional, kind-hearted, talented artists I`ve ever worked with. He took my crazy idea and turned it into something amazing. I didn`t have to sit around waiting for him to draw it up, as I did at Urban Art. He had me come in and approve it a few days before my appointment. He worked for 4 hours and only charged me for 3. I can`t wait to get it finished!<11<6<2013<18<1<36
M8uay4lsw_jSiAjAqIc8pg<69xsJFjiOAd8Ld7WWk_tEw<T4g4k2OhCTsiqcP-ZXElHQ<2<2<0<0<My friend recommended this restaurant while we were trying to find a place for lunch. There were a few tables available plus a small patio but seemed pretty good. My friend ordered 2 appetizers. She had the vegetarian onion soup and the beef tartar. I ordered the tuna tartar as a main.  The food came late as there was a mix up with the waitress and the kitchen. We were chatting but there was about a 20 min wait until the waitress told us the problem. She mentioned that there was a printing error but luckily, we were not in a rush. Her soup came first and then the tartars came afterwards.  My friend was surprised that the soup which had cheese at the bottom was good. She loved the beef tartar which was on the spicy side as per her request. My order came on the mild side and I did enjoy it but it was more a ceviche than a tartar. Service was quick afterward especially refilling the waters.  However, my stomach was turned upside down after 30 minutes and I rushed to the washroom. I ended up with a light dinner to rest my stomach. I doubt I will be back anytime soon or at all. Wondering why the ratings are high given my bad experience.<7<10<2019<22<53<7
lD0s545bONzQGAe3-rU8lQ<yiPeEVQmtw-jhn-7nazBag<a_YmdT9FD-QyGlJczj8mOw<5<0<0<0<What a place! I had the most amazing and relaxing facial there performed by  Svetlana. She works only with natural, organic cosmetics by the way! I loved how she supplemented my experience with essential oils that made it truly special! Not to mention how awesome it was to inhale the therapeutic salts that adorn the walls of the rooms, so soothing and cleansing. Can`t wait to be back!<28<11<2019<4<51<19

Collard greens are good.  Lemonade is very good.  Staff was friendly.  Place is small but nicely set up.   Corn bread is very very bad and dry. I mean bad.   Food wasn`t served hot. Looked better than it tasted.  BBQ sauce is very limited in style. They have two house sauces that are very heavy vinegar tasting. I tried to use the sauce to enhance the food because it was bland and lacked flavor. It was so vinegarish it was all just a wash.   Chicken was pretty good but not great.  Brisket was dry and under seasoned. Ribs were just decent- not well seasoned.  Pork- not worth mentioning.   Overall for a '"BBQ SPOT'" it missed the mark for me. I normally clear my plate. I couldn`t even finish my $23 meal. It just wasn`t worth the fill.   What a disappointment.   If you can`t find anything else to eat try it for yourself. Not terrible but not like close to 4-5 stars."<6<12<2019<22<59<29

I said '"only the bacon plz'" then quickly decided I would like the whole thing toasted but that seem to really bother her, she rolled her eyes at me the proceeded to laugh and whisper to her colleagues. I also asked for onion and she said it`s not on the menu..she then rudely told me to go pay. I paid and after I paid she asked the cashier if she charged me extra for the onion. They were extremely rude! The sandwich was just okay, not worth $11. Would not recommend this place to anyone"<7<12<2019<20<45<50

My family and I went here excited to try Indian food and we were not disappointed! The lunch buffet ($15/per person) on the weekend was huge and offered close to 30 different dishes. Each dish was clearly labeled with name + ingredients. They had a steady stream of occupants eating that seemed to be regulars. We really enjoyed our meal and I would certainly go back!<8<12<2019<13<56<56

6AvpYjEwtfrwuIivkxKOHw<PY7F_e80w_JqFZRtsAJwAA<E4rP1vUNZlFtFvQQvxRVbQ<1<7<2<2<The company or their employees must have written these reviews, note how there are no reviews on their web-site, I know why; This has been one of the most disappointing, disgusting skams , I have ever encountered. My sister came in to check the apartment and get a quote for the rental, they showed her the only 1 bedroom, and said there were no studios left, The quote was 1295.00 to 1395.00 for the unit. I came over two weeks later to rent the apartment, was told it would be 200.00 more a month for a short term, first payment was for 1630.00 with a couple of extras. Then in February Chase called and Said they tried to put thru a rent payment for 1980.00 Their response was I did not read the contract carefully. The next rent was for over 1800.00, you have to go on a portal every month to see what your rent is. I knew I was to pay electric and cable, that`s what I was told: Not so;  They charge you for trash, garbage, sewer, and common electric. plus a service fee of 150.00 plus taxesI I can not afford 400.00 to 500.00 a month over what I thoughtI was paying. Emily turned the pages of the contract and showed me where to initial, I still do not have a copy. What ever you do take some one with you and take your contract to someone else or an attorney.It was my error not to take the contract and have someone read it also. I am an older widow and trusted them. The manager Rachel came in but said all this was my fault because I did not read the contract carefully, and this is not what I was told. My rent for a 1 bedroom, is 1530.00 base, It should be 1395.00 + 200 = This property is very nice, but not worth this kind of money. Hope this will save a lot of you my pain.<22<2<2019<3<9<36

We were literally the ONLY table at 4:30 on a Tuesday afternoon. They got the party started with some complimentary stale chips and some flavorless salsa.  I decided to order the chimichangas since I recently had some great ones at another restaurant. I asked for one ground beef and one beef tip. When they arrived they were both ground beef and they were not very crispy or flaky at all. Like they weren`t fried long enough. A total bummer amigo.  And despite being the only table the waitress had the drink refills were far and few between.  It`s like they don`t even care. Adios El Rodeo!<30<4<2013<22<11<6
6GmlLMUbwwSwc8sG01WC5g<HmzUekbAmV3-kSaJ8uuH8w<bAdlbqHs4ayJxOXOUFQDyw<2<2<0<0<"Nami used to be great a long time ago when it was owned by a Japanese crew. It is not the case anymore. There are still some Japanese employees but it is clearly managed/owned by a different team.   Restaurant looks the same but when you enter, no more '"irrashaimase'" (welcome in Japanese). Very cold feeling.   Our waitress was very nice and polite. The two stars are for her!   We ordered sushi, tempura and some grilled items.Presentation was fancy, with some unnecessary gold paper on sushi to make it look expensive. Sushi rice was mushy and cold. Fish was ok. Tempura had a very sweet tentsuyu sauce and tasted average. We also ordered an expensive glass of sake (18$). It was served in the traditional small glass in a box. Except in Japan it is full. This time the tiny cup was half empty!!! Definitely non-Japanese style.  Some woman (I guess the new manager??)was training and giving orders in a rude way to our lovely waitress who was doing a great job right in front of us.   Will NEVER go back.   There are plenty of authentic Japanese options in Toronto.  Too bad this Nami Restaurant I used to love became like this."<1<10<2019<23<15<30

Simple treatment, as I have had them before. After being checked it by one of her employees with a bad attitude; As a side note, as I was waiting in the waiting area one of her employees, either a medical assistant or nurse was yelling and scolding an elderly patient. This made me so angry that I became sick, otherwise I would have put that employee in her place. With this in mind, I cancelled my appointment and had paid my $40.00 copay. They said that they would hold on to the payment for my next scheduled visit. BEWARE that this office charges for cancelations and no shows which should be unlawful. When I was a practicing physical therapist PhD, with my own business, it was against the law to do such a thing. Well, she gets away with it. I canceled my other visit with John and dealt with my boil problem on my own, no thanks to this horrible business. Most all of her employees are either quiet or sarcastic little ******. John did a fine job as I explained and Woodson was running very late and many were complaining. Nobody, with all the employees she has on staff comes and tells you anything about waiting time. Why could I do that with a patient load far exceeding hers and she couldn`t? She needs to learn how to run a business. I will not pay this co-pay bill and DO NOT book an appointment with Woodson Dermatology as there are many others all around Las Vegas.<3<12<2019<16<18<0

It is a very unique store with some pretty awesome furniture... With  that being said, I bought the only two they had in stock in the blue color and was asking if maybe I can get a slight discount for buying both of them at the same time, because it totally is $900... The sales person said no we don`t negotiate and that if I was to buy those at another store that the price would be negotiated down to what they`re selling them for, the owner was on site and she said '"you can ask the owner but he`s going to say no '"to my reply was why would I embarrass myself like that? I was just hoping they would work with me a little bit... She said the owner tells his sales associates that if he wants he can adjust his prices up and then you can go negotiate them down to what he sells them for, the sales associate overall was kind of snarky and kind of rude, I would not buy from here again,   because of the uniqueness of the pieces that are on the floor. Five stars for the selection of products, one star for the customer service and overall sales experience equals three stars... As a person in customer service myself, you may want to train your employees not to be snarky and have smart ass things to say when you ask about a slight discount. Avoid.  And by the way, let`s talk about this invoice that I got from them there is no return policy posted anywhere there`s no literature included with the purchase just all seems kind of hokey they use an old fashion receipt book and then a receipt from the credit card print out stapled to it, I have seen previous reviews especially on Google where the owner says our policies are clearly posted in our store however I did not see anything at all and there`s nothing printed on the invoice or receipt"<4<12<2019<19<35<48

Both he and I were there to witness it...That`s not even the troubling park.  I reported it to front desk and the manager practically harassed me for  making them aware of the situation. His frustration with me makes me questions the ethical behavior of the staff. He treated me poorly for doing the right thing. What example are they setting. Everyone is a paying customer and we almost were robbed and he focused his hostility towards me. There`s something wrong going on in there. I hope this review will shed some light for you guys and help with some accountability. These guys can`t go to the bathhouse and tell their friends to join for the purpose of stealing when people literally have their pants down. Be alert when here and report it to authorities not for the sake of yourself but the people after you who face the same ordeal  However, the venue itself is nice and big and clean so I raised it from a 1 star to 2 star. However when you have paying customers, you need to protect them and their privacy to the best of your ability. The staff as well as some of the guests might be there to loot your stuff and belongings. And a lawsuit could be in order if there is proof of misconduct. Ppl who witness their belongings being taken, should report to authorities that actually take it as a concern<24<6<2018<11<12<52

As a big fan of Pai and Khao San Road, I`m extremely happy with this Chiang Rai. The restaurant has a downtown hipster vibe, and a pleasant aroma of rich spices. I tried the khao soi golden curry and it was so flavourful. The noodles were tasty and on the softer side (which I prefer), the beef was a bit chewy for my liking but came in a big portion. I loved how it came with soft boiled egg too. The Thai ice tea was simply perfect. We came in for lunch at 12:30pm and 90% of the tables were full, but by 1pm it was cleared so they have a good turnaround time. Service was great.

Maybe 5x. But it`s like....300x more expensive. Value proposition fail.   I asked the lady jokingly, '"Have you found business has really picked up since the mainstream popularity of the Girl with The Dragon Tattoo? This is what brought me here'". She was obviously repulsed with this remark. We just looked at each other in silence awkwardly for about 10 seconds and she said modern furniture is generally popular.

Pizza, as usual, took forever to come out and it wasn`t even deep dish. The crust had the same texture as cardboard. It was just an ok pizza. Decided to take it home anyways because I didn`t want to waste food. Well, when I left the restaurant and got to my car, I realized I left my box inside. I walked back inside the restaurant and they told me they already threw my food away! This all happened within a minute, they didn`t even bother to catch me outside to tell me I left it. As I turned around to leave, some lady staff member condescendingly yelled to me,  '"GIRL! HEY GIRL!'"  Excuse me, I`m not a dog, I`m a grown adult. She wanted to get my attention to offer me a frozen pizza to take home, but because of the quality of the first pizza, I`m sure the frozen one was going to be worse so I declined.  The food here is of course awful, (its Giordano`s, what do you expect?) but the staff is rude, condescending towards customers, and need to be handled since they obviously don`t have manners.

Like most of the negative reviews, mine is no different.  When I called to schedule an appt. for my husband and I, it was a two month wait.  Upon arrival we were told we`d be seeing the PA, Erika Kimble.  I questioned why I wasn`t made aware of this when I scheduled our appointment and the receptionist had no answer.  My appt. was at 12:45 and my husband`s at 1:15.  We were both called in at approx. 1:25 by a nurse who took us into an exam room.  She began asking questions regarding our medical history and why we were there.  I told her we both need a full body exam as well as specific spots, on my husband`s leg, that need looked at, per his primary doctor who was concerned and wanted a dermatologist to exam them.  The nurse informed us that they don`t do full body exams at an initial appt. and that we would have to schedule another exam for the lower extremities.  Huh?!  I politely asked why and that should`ve been told to me when I made the appt. TWO MONTHS EARLIER!  I asked if the $120 copay I just paid (for both of us) covers the second appt. that THEY REQUIRE in order to exam the entire body.  The answer was no.  Again, very politely (it`s not her fault or her policy), I said that`s unacceptable.  My husband cannot wait another two months to have the spots on his leg checked!  She said she`d check with the doctor/PA(?) to see what, if anything, can be done.  She came back and said the PA would, in fact, do a full body exam on both of us.  I was extremely thankful and said so, numerous times, to the nurse.  When the PA, Erika Kimble, came into the exam room I expressed our gratitude for agreeing to do the full body exam.  Erika was unfriendly and has no bedside manner, whatsoever.  Her '"full body'" exam was cursory, at best, and was a total of 3-5 min (and that`s only because I asked a question or two) and everything was labeled an '"age spot'". I feel completely ripped off of $120 due to the fact that I have ZERO confidence in Erika`s competence and her lack of thoroughness so now I have to spend another $120 to see another, competent, thorough, dermatologist."<7<8<2019<1<11<37

This is real shuffleboard mind you, they also have tabletop, but we played the real thing.  I certainly hope that places like this aren`t unique for long, someone in Buffalo please get this started!  My brother lives in Cleveland and him and his wife are part of a league here, so when in town visiting him for the Bills game he rented a court for 2 hours on Saturday.  We had a group of 6 and the 2 hour timeframe worked out great.  He mentioned that when he has come in the past with a group of 4 that a 1 hour time slot worked out nice.    Everything you need is provided for you.  They offered to have one of the workers help get us started and explain the rules etc, but my brother and his wife know the drill so they explained and helped instead.  The waitresses come around though with menus and drinks and refills.  They do have food, although on this occasion we just ordered drinks.    The atmosphere is really cool, there is a '"jumbotron'" with info in the middle, photos of famous coaches real and fictional on the walls, stadium seats from some big known sports stadiums, cool sports quotes, tabletop shuffleboard also, and a nice large bar area and a variety of tables.

UPDATE:  I appreciate the store`s response to my review.  No one wants a negative review and I will say that it`s a beautiful showroom and staffed with friendly people. But, every motorcycle should be priced, all other shops I`ve been to use pricetags!  If there are new incentives, then the rep can explain that bonus upon inquiry. Sometimes, a customer just wants to browse and compare bikes without involving a salesperson.  And by the way, I have owned four motorcycles.

My oh my, this was the fanciest brunch of my life.  From the food to the service to the decor (my god, the decor), everything just felt immaculate. Is this what it feels to be part of royalty?   Sunday Brunch is held every week in the very impressive, very grand Sovereign Ballroom at the luxurious Omni King Edward Hotel. If you`ve never been here, it`s a real treat. Floor to ceiling ornate moulding, giant sparkling chandeliers, window-covered walls to let in all that natural sun. It`s like stepping into a palace and reliving every childhood princess fantasy you ever had.   If you remember to look down from the beautiful ceiling, you`ll notice the Sunday brunch. The food is almost just as bougie as the decor but I`m happy to say it doesn`t just look good, there`s fantastic quality as well. Their signature Foie Gras Beef Wellington was perfectly medium rare with savoury foie-mushroom paste surrounding a juicy morsel of beef. The hand-carved lamb was so tender. Even the chicken, which by buffet standards are usually dryer than cardboard, was moist and flavourful.   Happy to report their vegetarian selection was impressive as well. Massive table with multiple salads boasting ingredients like heirloom beets, roasted pear, and proscuitto. Next to it was an array of antipasto options, then pastry options. Another section was entirely dedicated to intricate desserts including fancy mini cakes, tarts, and whole pies. Fresh juice was served endlessly and coffee was poured out of a silver pot on the table. It was truly a feast for the eyes as much as it was for the mouth.   Omni King Edward`s Sunday brunch buffet is perfect. It`s expensive, but not insanely so, for the quality and service. It`s definitely more of a treat-yo-self moment unless your regular Sunday brunch includes getting serenaded by a live harp player. For the regular folk, a $60 buffet certainly warrants a special occasion, and Omni King definitely makes it special.  There aren`t a lot of places where you can get white-glove service, in a black-tie ballroom setting, while wearing jeans.   (60/100) - 2019<11<11<2019<18<49<11

I had the worst experience and come to find out I am not the only one.... Do not chance it... Stay far far away! I was referred to Mari by my long time hair stylist because they work in the same salon suites. (which she now regrets referring me and feels awful because she has other clients who had similar situations) I went to Mari one time and regret ever going.   I have been getting Botox and injectables for over 15 years and never once had any issues.    I went to Mari for routine botox, she injected my forehead and talked me into getting more '"botox'" then I originally wanted.  Everything was fine right after the injection, fast forward 3 hours, my forehead was in extreme pain.  Every injection site was swollen, red and painful, I couldn`t even let water touch my face with out extreme pain.  This lasted for a little over 3 days, my face was swollen, bruised, red and very painful.    I brought this to Mari`s attention and she insisted that I come back in to be seen and re-treated.    I was not comfortable with coming back in to be re-treated and I let her know that.  I also asked her for a refund after the full two weeks had passed because I had no results.   I still had wrinkles in my forehead, which I NEVER have after less botox then what she injected.  I paid $380 dollars for who knows what she injected in my face.  I requested a refund from her again and she refused and called me a bully, she again insisted that I come in and be retreated.  First of all, I have never once had a reaction like this and I have never once had botox not work.   Mari has the worst customer service and basically blamed me, didn`t take any accountability, wasn`t even apologetic.    Clearly her main focus is on money and not clients, she proved that when she injected fake Botox in my face and then refused to refund me ANY of my $380.    She told me this had never happened to any of her clients before, fast forward a few weeks later when I was getting my hair done and the lady in the chair next to me was telling me that the same EXACT thing happened to her from Mari several months ago, not only that Mari injected filler in her cheeks that was now displaced and left her with huge bumps under her eyes and in the sides of her face.    I know there  must be others out there.  I urge you to file a complaint with the medical board and the BBB.  Links are attached at the bottom of the page.  We can not allow Mari to continue to inject '"who knows what'" into another face.  You can also contact the salon suites and notify them of malpractice in their building.  https://www.bbb.org/consumer-complaints/file-a-complaint/get-started   https://gls.azmd.gov/glsuiteweb/Clients/AZBOM/Private/OnlineComplaints/ComplaintDoctorSearch.aspx?WebID=8963de67-4a0b-4fa5-9af9-8c0a7df729f7  https://thebeautydistrict.com/contact/"<6<10<2019<15<25<35

I`m teetering between a 3 and 3.5 stars, but if I gave the 3.5 then I`d have to round up to a 4... and I ain`t doing that, so 3 it is!  Let`s begin.  Atmosphere/Appearance: Right off of a little side street very close to the Bell Center is this gem.  There are multiple levels and this place is HUGE.  I bet it really fills up whenever there`s something going on at the center... which seemed to be all the time.  It certainly gave me a steakhouse vibe with all of the dark woods, big booths, low lighting and open spaces.  I liked it.  The upbeat music threw things off, but you know, whatever.  Lol.  Service: Noah took excellent care of us.  It seemed like he had tables all over the place and was rushing around quite a bit, but he never missed a beat.  Shout out to him!  On the flip side, the bathroom near the front was a disaster and I made the host aware of this... but nothing seemed to get done throughout my entire visit.  Maybe they just didn`t care?  I don`t know, but a clean bathroom is must.  Food: It`s hit and miss here.  So I did start with their Ahi Tuna Appetizer and it was a hit for sure.  It was sesame crusted tuna seared just right over a bed of greens then drizzled with some kind of sauce.  I highly recommend.  I was feeling mighty hungry so I opted for the Baton Rouge Trio!  It comes with 10 oz. of ribs, a flame-grilled chicken breast and a grilled jumbo black tiger shrimp skewer all smothered in our signature BBQ sauce.  Well... my chicken was over-cooked and there was just WAY TOO MUCH sauce on my dish.  (Go look at my picture.  You can hardly see the meat, it`s a sea of dark red sauce.)  It didn`t even look good, but it tasted better than it looked, but not amazing.  Value: All prices are in $CAD.  Tuna appetizer was only $15.00 and my Trio was $43.00.  That`s not too bad for a steakhouse and for the amount of food that I had.  Then again, it`s not cheap and you might want to check out the happy hour here.  In conclusion this place was okay.  It`s not my cup of tea, but I may try it again later if a colleague or co-worker wants to try this place out.  I won`t be back on my own though.<20<11<2019<17<9<29

Having lived in New Zealand and having to shell out $20 for a tiny organic burrito...yeah, that just left a bad taste in my mouth for trying Mexican food overseas.  Apparently, Montreal is slapping me upside the head for my closed minded thoughts. This place is LEGIT!!!  We ordered the veggie burrito and the tacos al pastor...just heavenly!  I love that they don`t even ask you mild, medium, or spicy. You just eat it how it`s given to you. Just like mamma would.  I would not have it any other way and it was the perfect amount of kick.  The tortillas seems like they are fresh and homemade. If there weren`t people around, I would have licked my plate.  Do yourself a favor and try this place. Add a Mexican Coke (yes, there is a huge difference) with your order and you`re golden.<24<6<2018<20<7<16
0HGdp2Lbg_JlJTrTDOv5Ig<2VRkBZBS5FO_N7yBRWfaLA<2Zxqj0hVg-2TdDidmPOPPA<5<5<3<5<What a gorgeous trail - shame on me for living in Scottsdale this long and not hiking Sunrise Peak until now! After my long, drawn-out acceptance that Camelback is no longer the epitome of hiking in the Valley, this trail provided much encouragement to escape the masses that now crowd more popular hikes and to continue exploring the amazing landscape that is Arizona.  I would call this an intermediate hike. Nothing too technical required by way of footing, but the incline is fairly steady and rarely gives up. This of course means footing on the way down should be taken with care, as you may grab a granular patch gravel and find yourself slipping. The steepest sections don`t last very long, making the majority of the hike very enjoyable without feeling too labor intensive or too mild - excellent heart-pumping but accessible climb. My dogs faired very well despite some rocky portions, and the trail was mostly wide enough to pass people coming up and down without too much pause. Traffic was steady but never crowded. I imagine lots of water is key on warmer days, but try not to pass this up in winter months, as it`s truly breathtaking on a cool, crisp morning. Bathrooms at the trailhead are great, but you`ll not find much hidden cover along the trail if you need to go again. May want to have a lookout with you :)  The views. Holy crap the views. Plenty of places to stop and take it in, but the Peak itself will not disappoint. A 360 perspective out to 4 Peaks, over to Camelback, South Mountain and beyond. A real treat especially on a clear day. If like me you are a bit jaded about sharing more popular hikes with inexperienced hikers and tourists, go enjoy a lesser traveled trail and bask at the top in a much superior vista!<9<1<2017<23<47<14

BXCTmiZ0ortcwFGJlhSJLw<5ooS7bdyvtDXOnSQPRcS0Q<arkOZb9cazVWeoUSCL_2UA<1<1<0<0<The service department at Hendrick BMW Northlake is the worst I have ever experienced.   I have owned Infiniti`s, Nissan, Jeep and Fords and every one provided better service.  Making an appointment is a joke.  Repeatedly I have made appointments and waited 2 hours for them to even come tell me what the issue is and not even have fixed anything yet.  One experience I had a 10:00 appointment and had a friend pick me up.  When I called at 4 they hadn`t even looked at the car and said it would not be until tomorrow!  There is no true appointments.  And if you need a loaner you will need to schedule weeks in advance because there are never any appointments with loaners for the same week.  Ridiculous.  With Inifiniti I never had an issue getting a loaner or having to EVER wait like Hendrick repeatedly requires.  Never mind that twice when they fixed my car their errors created other problems.  If you buy a BMW make sure you have reasonable access to any other service department or you will regret your purchase as much as I do.<30<11<2016<13<57<59

This is my go-to place for before or after event drinks. This is a place you can walk right in without a wait before heading to the Overture or Majestic, when other nearby restaurants and bars might be mobbed. A place to sit and relax instead of wondering if you can be in and out with enough time to make it to your curtain call.  If you enjoy comfort, homeyness and a low-key bar experience over hip or trendy digs then this place will do it for you. I`ve tried some of the food and it wasn`t half bad either. The one area that could use improvement is the extremely bare bones restroom that is located in the basement... the ceiling is very low and claustrophobic. I appreciate they are working with what they have and the restroom has been clean every time I`ve used it.   Try it out you may just fall in love with it`s mix of epic 80`s tunes piped in over the speakers, mood lighting and it`s $5 Old Fashions.<12<6<2017<1<34<36

Indifferent service though somewhat fast.   The pool of grease in the wrapper nearly triggered a gag reflex.

I`m partial to the Benny Goodman dish because I love me some smoked salmon, poached eggs, and hollandaise sauce. If you can`t decide between a couple of their benny dishes, you can go with the Benny Duo where you can try half of each dish. I love that that`s an option! Also, you can`t dine here and skip one of their pancakes or french toasts. I ordered the OMG French Toast during my last visit and it was really tasty! I thought that it had the perfect amount of sweetness to it.  The service here has been great during each of my visits. The servers seem to work in teams and they`re all attentive. Expect a long wait, especially during peak hours where you could wait as long as 2 hours! Bring a snack to munch on while you wait. In my opinion, the wait is worth it. :) Also beware of their tiny parking lot! I never have any luck in that lot so I usually park on the streets in the surrounding neighborhood.<4<1<2017<8<8<39

s_oq2m1Ukqu3E_2MRgsJEA<jfJxAPVjo7NgEsyLGy1lPg<Doqz6-NiXEPhr28koWESKw<1<2<0<0<THERE WAS A LARVAE WORM MAGGOT IN MY FOOD at the Santa Fe Hotel & Casino Station Grand Cafe on November 18, 2019! I am so beyond disgusted with what occurred. I ordered the NY Steak meal which consists of steak, mashed potatoes and gravy and broccoli. I took several bites out of all the food on my plate before noticing a larvae worm on the mashed potatoes and broccoli that was on my spoon which I was about to consume. Chad the Executive Chef came out to apologize and informed it was most likely the broccoli was not properly washed resulting in serving me the customer a plate of food including a larvae worm. That was pretty horrifying to hear as the broccoli is the food on my plate I consumed the most before finding that worm!! There were about 4-5 big pieces of broccoli and I ate almost all of it except for the very last piece of broccoli because of what I found. Before the employees and the manager on duty took away the plate of food, I did take some photos as evidence and I did file a report with the security guard there. My mother was also eating with me and she ordered the salmon meal consisting of salmon, rice and broccoli too! We are unaware if there was any larvae worms in her food because we did not look through it carefully and they had taken away both of our plates of food back to the kitchen. I asked the manager if there would be any compensation, but she said all she can do is offer a free dinner comps back at the same Grand Cafe for NEXT time. After finding what I found in my food, of course we have no appetite or interest to eat at that cafe because it is so disgusting!! We were not offered to fill any reports either, we had to request it. In the end, Karizma the manager did allow us to choose some desserts that were fresh in the front cashier display. HOWEVER, before the incident we planned to pay with comps/coupon and even after all that, they still asked about our check and took the comps/coupon paper we had away from us and kept it so in a way it was still paying and we were not compensated at all! We do have a copy of the file reported, the manager on dutys card, photos and the receipt of what we paid for the desserts which states on the receipt of the comp they took from us. I felt immediately sick to my stomach and the following morning I did throw up. It is concerning knowing the amount of broccoli I consumed. I feel it is unacceptable how basically nothing, but an apology was done to properly handle this situation. The next day we called and spoke to Ron Head of Santa Fe Management on the phone and were instructed to return. When we arrived Ron was not available and we were left to deal with the security which was not helpful. The staff made it feel like it is an annoyance hearing about it and as if we are bothering them. We are not at fault in the slightest bit! All we wanted was to have a good dinner and these people served food with a larvae worm to our table, said we can choose desserts then still made us pay for the desserts! That`s not right! I never leave reviews. Especially, a negative one, but since nothing was resolved I have a right to speak up on what happened as a customer. Overall, it is just a horrible experience. We plan to never eat there again.<20<11<2019<13<38<58

My friends and I each ordered a different platter so we could taste all of the different meat options and sides which was a stellar choice. My favorites were the pulled pork and brisket. The portions are huge so it was definitely nice to have leftovers the next day. And, as a final treat, each table is given freshly made cinnamon sugar donuts to take home in little doggie bags.

Then I was told I had to pay for each side of the keys to be cut 2 dollars for each side tot walling 8 dollars. I said the dealer was almost cheaper, the lady told me to go to the dealer. Also I was told no Military discount. I had the prior owners of the Acme (The Lock Shop) take can of my keys. I would highly recommend them. You can read my outstanding review for them..

I wrote a detailed account of that evening but it appears as though the owner has somehow made it disappear.  In a nutshell, I was served a dish that was not what I ordered.  When I pointed that out, the server said that she would see if it was possible for me to receive what I ordered.  She returned and said it was not.  The owner came out - we did not request to see him - and began his verbal attack and threats.  He stood at the table as we stared in amazement telling us he didn`t want people like us in the restaurant.  He left the table and returned to kitchen then came back multiple times escalating with each return.  His comments included, '"I don`t like you people'", '"I`m calling the police'", '"You`re dismissed from the restaurant'", and finally '"Get out'".  He grabbed my wife`s plate of uneaten food and said she didn`t deserve to eat.  We are in our 60`s, have professional work and we`re simply out for a pleasant evening.  We were horrified and I made a police report when I returned home.  This behavior is unacceptable and potential customers need to be aware of this hateful environment."<4<7<2019<14<5<0

They take care of all the small details & let you have the choice on what venues you wanna check out. They give you a copy of the itinerary so you can choose to jump in the crawl when you want. I recommend starting from the very beginning though to get the most bang for your buck as the first two locations have awesome drink specials before ending up at the clubs. Once arriving to the clubs you get express entry and get to skip the massive lines. That`s worth it in itself if you ask me. It`s so nice having everything planned out to where all you have to do is show up and have a good time! Will definitely continue to use their services on future vacations.<15<7<2019<22<37<29

Out of these orders our favourites were the apple croissants; a delicious almond filled croissant with soft baked apple layer on top.   Although I noticed an array of vast macarons, I was not keen to try as their flavours were nothing but the ordinary. For macaron consumers, these sizable cookies would be an indelible treat.

Every holiday season groups of idiots feel obligated to bring a Christmas tree to the top and cover it with trash that blows off and litters the mountain peak.

This mountain is average at best because of all the people who choose to hike here.  They blast music on speakers, they are constantly taking selfies and could care less about hiker etiquette.  If you really want peace and quiet where you can enjoy nature (what hiking is all about) go to the Superstitions, Usery Mtns or even South Mountain to achieve pure Zen on the trail.  Much less litter, noise and douchers at these mountains rather than Camelback.   That being said... Camelback is a great workout hike.  Lots of incline on a 1.8 mile trail.

After its renovation and Aramark took over from Sodexo, many things changed - seating area, decor, arrangement of the different stations, and the introduction of Coke products.  When I first stopped in here, it was to see my students and be visible outside of my office.  Now, the students I have are busy running their own restaurants on campus so I just come for the food.  Yes, you heard it!  The DC posts its menus 2-3 weeks in advance by the day and the meal.  I stalk the menu waiting for the pad thai day.  There was a time I walked in and boom - there was pad thai.  It was so good!  I also came in once and had Chinese chicken stir fry served in take out boxes....yum!  Today was Pad Thai day according to the menu for lunch, along with Thai beef red curry.  Well, I paid for lunch ($9.03 with tax, so it has gone up a tad) and headed straight for where the curry should be.  Well, there was a shrimp curry instead, so I got that on rice.  Then I go to the where the pad thai should be and nope...no pad thai....BUT - MONGOLIAN BBQ?!?!!?  There was the giant Mongolian grill thingy, bowls, different veggies to add, choice of meat, and choice of sauces!  AND choice of spicy on a scale of 1-5!  (Choice of rice or noodles too!!!!)  What???  There was a long line but I got in at the right time.  I got broccoli, napa cabbage, onion, bamboo shoots, baby corn, water chestnuts, ginger, garlic, bean sprouts.....mmmm!  Then I asked for beef, a combo of soy and chile sauce, and spicy level 3 or 4, with noodles.  The action chef handled about 7 orders on her grill, but knew which meals belonged to each customer.  While I waited I ate my shrimp curry (yummy).  Then, it was ready.  I ran my steaming bowl over to the salad bar and sprinkled edamame on top, clutching my chopsticks.  I also found TWO types of fresh red beets (shredded raw and fresh roasted) - put those in a little bowl, and scurried over to a table near the Coke products.  My steaming bowl was full of vegetables, with a ton of beef, lots of spice and flavor, and the beets on the side cooled me down.  Though I did not get any of the Thai offerings on the menu, this was a very pleasant surprise and I left wholly satisfied...though now I wonder if the menus are ever going to be what is actually there!  The salad bar is always awesome, and I hope to return for more beets in the future.  They play 90s on 9 here!!!!<7<3<2013<20<48<56

The only problem we ran into was that we were assigned a waitress while we were bowling. She said she`d check back in with us, but she didn`t come back. About halfway through our bowling session one of my friends went to order some food for us herself, and the waitress intercepted her and told her she wasn`t allowed to do that because we had to order through her. She didn`t come back to our lane for another 10 or 15 minutes after that, either-- but she did greet the lane next to ours, who appeared to be regulars.

In a rush to get food to go after being at the hospital for a few hours with my cousin.  My mother stood in line to order food while my 80 year old grandmother tried to go to the bathroom.  It was lock so she came to the counter to get a key but they replied to MY 80 YEAR OLD HARMLESS GRANDMA '"our policy is to not allow anyone access our restrooms until they purchase something'" mind you my mother is in line waiting to order.  I called the manager Bryan about this and he was no help and non apologetic.  He told me that this policy is in place so they dont have to deal with people who make a mess In the restroom.

I had the beet salad with pulled chicken.  At first, I thought they had forgotten the chicken. When I asked the server, she told me that it was on the bottom of the salad so as not to wilt the greens.  Made good sense to me.

She always fits me in if I schedule a manicure ahead of time with her or if I walk-in last minute.   I continuously show her the latest designs from pinterest and instagram, and she soars with my design ideas. When I was dreading the winter weather, she painted a tropical pineapple perfectly. She recently coordinated my nails to match a dress I had for a work function.   I have tried several of the area salons and they have told me numerous times that they do not have time for nail art, do not know how to do my designs I like, or charge extra for the designs. This is NOT the case with Kathy. My acrylic manicure with gel polish costs roughly $45 with tax, without tip.   I cannot wait to get a pedicure at Solon Nail once it is flip-flop season :)<27<3<2019<2<32<22
ih_Krl8mVR0Z-_ZJwD_nFA<PYsK99oy7Om2Dmw1eUMRmw<-FLnsWAa4AGEW4NgE8Fqew<4<0<0<0<This place was great. I got the breakfast burrito with the potato/veggies and fruit. It was definitely packed but thats cause the food / atmosphere is awesome and modern. I did not wait more than 2 minutes because I was alone and there was a space open at the counter.   The burrito was huge so they laid it down and drizzled hot sauce on it so I had to eat it with a fork and knife but i was totally ok with that. The ingredients tasted fresh and flavorful. The eggs inside were fluffy and delicious. The potatoes were good, I mean they weren`t like spectacular or anything but they tasted good and they had fresh bell-peppers chopped up in them.  The price was amazing for how much food I got. Maybe thats just me being from San Francisco and being used to high prices but after a 20% tip I only spent $17.   Literally the only reason I did not give them a 5 star is because they didn`t cut the skins off the fruit so I had to cut them off myself after taking a huge a bite of the melon skin which was hard and crunchy. Hard and crunchy is not what you expect when taking a bite of fresh fruit. I know that is a huge nit-pick but it sort of ruined the end of the meal for me when i was looking to wash down the savory burrito and potatoes with some fresh fruit.  But I left there extremely happy and satisfied. I would 100% go back and take others with me.<15<9<2019<20<26<18
6-KasDuVGJSXpmk6JX6WrQ<M8GFFQ6fLUOdDPGkivOLrQ<2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ<4<1<0<1<This place is delicious!!! We`ve been to Las Vegas many times and we`ve always eaten at buffets that are in the hotels we stay or economical. My husband decided that he would splurge a little this time and we ended up here. It`s a beautiful location. It`s a garden, tea party style ambiance with beautiful bright colors! I wish the whole place was like the middle walk way and we could all eat our brunch under the flowers. Tables and floors are clean. I asked for coffee, which was pretty good and my husband had water because he knew he was going to get stuffed. I had a ham omelet with bacon, potatoes and a croissant. Followed by pizza, fried chicken and rotisserie chicken. I also had a made to order crepe. My husband had scrambled eggs, waffles, bacon, sausage, ribs, veggie rolls, Asian style wings, sweet pastries and tied it all up with fruit. I wish I had a bigger stomach so I could have EVERYTHING. The food tasted like actual food. Most buffets taste like microwaved food or carton food, but not this one. They offer an array of morning alcohol beverages including mimosas. You do have to watch your dress attire, which I think is a good thing in Las Vegas. It`s not too harsh, you just can`t walk around in a bathing suit which I think is proper etiquette. But they`re not too strict. Be prepared to get here early. We arrived at 9:30 am and left around 12 ish. It took us about 20 minutes to get seated. By 12 the line was really long past the pool doors. There was no way those people were gonna get in for probably an hour. The reason I give it 4 stars is because prices are not clear. Somewhere my husband saw that it was $29.99 and that`s the price we had in mind. Getting up to the register we find out it`s $37.99. It slipped my mind to ask why but I figured it`s because we`re not hotel guests. But I`m not actually sure why. Our total was about $80 for 2 adult buffets. I give it 4 starts based on this alone. Despite the confusion about the price, everything else was great. The server did forget my soda but she ultimately brought it to me and apologized. I would definitely come here again! One of the best buffets I`ve been too.<4<8<2019<21<3<2

Rxq3eRnPH6LeCVvtkRaU-g<4NOTjTJ1UTh8ThjQF79y9w<2YA_V5NMOQ3vBwyMKtQ95Q<2<0<0<0<"I picked the Dinner Detective as my birthday `event` which was held at the OMNI in Pittsburgh.  I invited 4 friends along.  The short version is that their mystery storyline is thin, acting is bad (I expected campy community theater level acting--I wasn`t foolish enough to think it would be Tony-Award Winner quality performances), the venue was cramped, food was poor, overall execution was clumsy, the entire thing went on about 30 minutes longer than necessary and the overall value is questionable.  If you want more details, read on:  It starts with a reception at 6pm.  This is a cash bar and a tired waitstaff '"passing'" mediocre hors d`oeurves (one per guest--napkins only on request).  The reception area was a very small foyer where the entire purpose is to `drop clues` to the guests.  Of course, unless you`ve attended one before, you don`t realize that the show starts then--and you must be in the right place at the right time to catch the clues.  You are asked to create a fictitious name and employment story line as you may be participating with other guests during the `show`.  We were then ushered into a very small dining room.  The room could comfortably accommodate a party of 40.  Instead, they crammed 7 tables of 12 into this room. I felt sorry for the wait-staff.    The production was disorganized in their communication with the guests during the reception and as a result, there was confusion as people understandably sat where they wished and promptly began eating the salads that had already been sitting on the tables for at least an hour. Another group had sat down at our assigned seats and the Master of Ceremonies of the show wouldn`t let us sit at a different table.  He made a big production of seating our group at our specified table--even after we graciously offered to sit at a different table.  So, after this poor group got re-seated, we finally sat down to salads that already had dressing poured or were picked over.  It was chaotic.   The food was standard hotel-fare.  Not great, not terrible.  Edible. The waitstaff were stressed out and confused.  The story line of the mystery was thin.  I`m being generous.  The Master of Ceremonies claimed that by the end of the evening, `Everyone will be able to figure out who dun-it`.  They made a big deal about a $100 prize given to the winning guest who solved the murder and who gave the most detail about who did it and what clues led them to their assertion.    Clues were provided for us to read through and we were encouraged to interview other guests to see which one of them might be the murderer.  One guest wore an eye patch and had scars on his face.  Sadly, many guests assumed he was an actor and grilled/interrogated him endlessly.  It turned out that he was a real guest, not an actor.     After almost three hours of clues and carefully watching the thin story line, the clues didn`t point to anyone we had been introduced to during the show. In the final minute of the evening, they pulled out a `character` who was never produced during the show, no reference to him, no wrap up or summary given to us about who he was or how we would`ve known it was him.  The prize winner of the evening was crowned, but her rationale/deduction for her winning answer was never shared with the group.    So, after clues that led nowhere, we got a quick, `That`s All Folks` with a bum`s rush to the door.  Probably trying to get everyone out before they realized this was a waste of their time and money.  The final insult is that in addition to the $70/per person fee for this three hour `event`, Gratuity Envelopes were on the table.  We do excursions and cruises, so we`re familiar with this practice and typically tip generously.  However, in this situation, it felt insulting.   The real issue ultimately is about value.  I`d have rather paid an additional $20/per person for a larger event room, better food, and better story line.  If you are going to this to be entertained (like an actual play), or have a decent meal, I recommend you do something else."<17<9<2019<19<14<1

After making reservations over a month in advance for a 50th anniversary family dinner, we were excited to be at Giada`s. When I made my reservation, I indicated that we requested a window table. Additionally, when I confirmed the reservation that afternoon I asked about the view and was told, '" all our tables look out over the strip...we have your requests from your reservation.'"  When we were shown to our table, I was surprised that we were in a back room with a TV playing a football game and no view. I went back to the hostess, and asked about our table. Stating that we had requested a view, I asked about options. She said that they did not have a table for our larger party. She then had me speak to the manager John. John apologized and offered to move us if we could wait a while. I reviewed that the reservation had been made over a month prior and that it was confirmed that afternoon. I did not want to wait, so asked that he could ensure that our meal experience was very good. He assured me he would, and that he would personally come to the table. Our meal experience was not very good. Appetizers were excellent. The eggplant entree was very salty. Other entrees were ok. Service was nice, but not very attentive. We piled our plates to get them out of our way, crumbs were not cleared from the table, etc. John never came by or checked on us. It was disappointing. At the end of the meal the server brought out a plate with 2 complimentary cookies that said happy anniversary. I tried to speak to John before leaving, but he was busy talking to a table.  I was looking to have an exceptional meal for my parents anniversary and was disappointed in all areas.

I like their system for handling the popularity, although I`m not sure how well known it is because there always seems to be a huge line. A hostess hovering by said line is willing to take your name and info along with your cell number; the staff will then text you when your table is ready! Easy, peasy. During this time, we headed over to Earl of Sandwich to deal with some of hunger pains. A bit unfortunate for this review of BurGR because the food at Earl of Sandwich was much better!   Now, I`ve had similarly pricey gourmet burgers so I didn`t find the cost here to be shocking. And given that this is Vegas, the portions are pretty good for the $. No complaints from me on that end. But the burger itself was really '"just'" okay. Not bad by any means but not so great that I would want to make a special trip out here. Gun to the head, I`d vote for the Farm Burger as my fav--but really, a fried egg makes everything better.   The use of iPads and technology makes the whole dining experience fun too, but I think the biggest draw of this place, for me, was the milkshakes. We shared the #5 which I believe was the hazelnut pudding and coffee shake. The top is a creamy pudding-mousse that tastes incredible as is, but also amazing when mixed with the coffee milkshake. The presentation leaves something to be desired but I guarantee you it tastes so much better than it looks! I liked this fancy interpretation more than real milkshakes--so much so that I haven`t even had a standard one since. The sticky toffee push pop desserts seem to be popular too, but I saw a couple at a nearby table order them and they looked seriously disappointing. I felt bad for them. Stick to the milkshakes (although they will come out with the meal rather than at the end, since apparently in `Murica we don`t consider milkshakes dessert).  So yeah, unless you`re staying at Planet Hollywood or somewhere nearby, I`d probably skip out on BurGR. Or if you`re eating somewhere else nearby (I recommend Earl`s), then at least visit here for just desserts."<20<5<2014<0<20<32

After the first wave of people had given it their initial try and the hype has died down, Pick 6ix has re-branded as an upscale sports bar, located right in the heart of Toronto`s Financial District.  I respect that the owner(s) of Pick 6ix didn`t half-ass their transformation to a sports bar - there are PLENTY of TV screens to catch the game, and the general atmosphere of the establishment is markedly more casual. It`s actually a pretty decent place to catch the big game, so long as you`re not expecting a place where '"everybody knows your name'". The beer/wine/cocktail selection is pretty formidable, and the traditional pub fare that you`d expect in a sports bar is all there in the menu (think: nachos, burgers, chicken wings).  It`s personally not my cup of tea, but if you work on Bay Street and you happen to get out of the office JUST in time for the big game, Pick 6ix is probably going to be your best bet."<13<5<2019<21<13<29

Whew - On to the review:  First off I never knew Oakhurst Grill for what it used to be called. I moved here not too long ago and drive by this place everyday, twice a day on the way to and from work. I decided one day to come in after the gym for some pulled pork. I had a deep craving that needed to be filled.  This is To-Go-Style, so you can wait for your for which is less than 10min or call and pick it up.   I ordered the pulled pork BBQ plate with mac and cheese and collard greens. You get a lot for what you pay for (Just under $10) and I had to put half in the fridge I was so full. I really liked the pork, and the collards were good. Not too salty, not overcooked. I also enjoyed the mac and cheese and devoured that in no time, no left overs on that end. They also popped two hush puppies in my to go box and a roll. Let me just say - -  these are probably the best hush puppies I`ve had since I moved to NC, and so that it very exciting.    I will be back, and can`t wait to try something different!<12<6<2013<17<31<18

The food is ice cold every time you pick it up. The cheese doesn`t even melt at this Chipotle. You can order it and immediately leave your house and it`s only 2 miles away and the food will STILL be ice cold.  I complained to corporate they sent a message on and apparently this Chipotle`s still doesn`t understand the people like hot food. If I were the manager of the Chipotle I would ask myself, why am I the worst rated restaurant in the area. The only plus about this place is that there is never a line, but when you consider WHY there`s never a line it`s not really a plus at all. The food is old and cold.

Servers and staff are friendly and accommodating. Our order consisted of Dynamite Roll, Mixed Tempura and Chicken Cutlet Dinner. They started us off with salad and a mini cup of ramen. The salad was pretty standard and what you`d expect at any Japanese restaurant. The ramen was nice, I don`t like fine ramen myself, but the noodles were good and the broth was tasty. Miso soup was served along with the mains and was good. The dynamite roll was fantastic. The tempura (shrimp and veggies) was great, light and crispy, not too oily. The chicken cutlet was very good and also came with a veggie croquet (ok) and spring roll (average). The server brought the kids green tea ice cream at the end of the meal which they of course loved. The food here is great and I will definitely be back.<11<10<2019<19<43<44

The two sides I chose were their garlic mashed potatoes and the seasonal vegetable, which was green beans. Mom ordered the Baja fish tacos, and it came with  seasoned crispy French fries, that she said were delicious. My sister ordered the lobster and shrimp gnocchi dish.

That`s a lot of pressure for someone especially the server and you may be pressed for time but a server has their hands full as well. They weren`t doing anything out of spite, they just may have been backed up. I`m sorry but that`s not very nice on the guests part if they can`t be understanding enough. The service has always been great here, they are very attentive, fast and they always give great suggestions. A sushi restaurant especially when you`re ordering the hot meals is not the right place to go during a quick lunch break unless you plan on sitting at the bar and ordering a quick roll.

The wall facing the side street was an open garage door style with seating there also.  Im new to the ramen scene, but was excited to try it. I ordered the inferno ramen with no substitutes and the spring roll.  The spring roll was SUPER tasty and the mustard dipping sauce was bomb. My bowl came quickly and was tasty, but was not very spicy. My husband`s bowl (can`t remember the name) had candied pig ears that were tasty, and a soft boiled egg that was really good.  My only gripe is that they were out of the bloody kimi mix! But I`ll def be back.<17<9<2018<19<56<15

1C-kOV5NdVDWMI-j5r8XKA<Cay9z_sZMjtdxG8lzZR2OA<ycwPgDxZCIhpUnYLuAlf_Q<1<1<0<0<I went to Caldwell County BBQ for the first time today. I went with a group of friends. I ordered the ribs and they were good, and the sauces were also good. The ribs could use more of a rub to add more flavor, but it was still pretty good. The person who took our order was so rude. It was in a bad mood for whatever reason. When we would ask questions about the menu it`s seem to annoy him. He must be the owners son or somehow tied to the business because it was horrible service. He was  rude and not helpful at all. It wasn`t very full inside, and he still seemed annoyed despite not being very busy. Then they charged my friends the wrong amount, and no big deal they fixed that, but again they seemed mad that we pointed out they charged 10 dollars more than they should have.  The reality is the food is pretty good, and the location is actually really really nice, but the service just sets the tone for not an enjoyable meal. It`s my fault for not just going to Joes BBQ where the service is always on point.  Being nice goes a long way. I never ever leave yelp reviews, but I had to let everyone know that the kid who takes your and slices the meat will be rude and unprofessional. He will tell you everyone group together so I don`t have to repeat myself. Just give him a smile, and be nice to him, and maybe he will understand someday that good barbecue is about serving food with love and passion.:)<18<8<2019<22<43<21

Therefore they are neither good nor evil.'" --Marcus Aurelius, Meditations   TL/DR: Delicious food, nice employees, over-priced food, and small serving sizes.  Traffic coming home from Charlotte was unpleasant. I didn`t feel like sitting parked in traffic on the interstate, on a 90F degree day. I decided to take the Belmont exit and have some barbecue.   I knew exactly where the restaurant was, because I had been to the restaurant`s former occupant: Ranucci`s. Ranucci`s was famous for their competition barbecued ribs, which they NEVER had available, so they went out of business.  There is plenty of free parking.    ORDERING is a go to the counter affair, pay, take a number, find a seat, and wait deal. (Bring your reading glasses or a magnifying glass if you wish to pay by credit card.)  I got the two meat platter with brisket and pulled pork, fries, coleslaw, and a fountain soda. $15.xx. (The cashier tried to gently dissuade me from ordering their coleslaw. I should have paid attention.)  This restaurant is charming, rustically decorated, and miniscule inside. I`d guesstimate that they may be able to seat 25 people max., probably more, but everyone would be elbow to elbow and miserable.   As an aside, their one person men`s bathroom was clean.   My food took about fifteen minutes to arrive. When my plate was presented I was kind of surprised at how little food there was, especially for $15+. There was only a token amount of brisket, two hush puppies, and at most two tsps. of coleslaw in a tiny paper cup. But I smiled, said thank you, and dug in.   There were about five sauces on the table, along with some ketchup and hot sauce. Salt. Pepper. Brown paper towel roll.   Pulled Pork, 3.5/5 Middle of the road. Not bad. Not great. The taste was good. The sauce that I finally settled on was their sweet original sauce with a splash of hot sauce mixed in. I WOULD recommend their pulled pork. I enjoyed it. It would make a great sandwich.  Beef Brisket, 2/5 It had good beef flavor (like pot roast), but there wasn`t much of it, and it was overcooked. I WOULD NOT order this again in the future.   (Brisket Pro Tip: Pull the brisket out of the smoker when it`s below done temp. It should have been wrapped in aluminum foil for the last 3 hours to prevent the brisket from drying out. Let it rest. The internal temperature will continue to climb.)  Thin Shoestring French Fries. 5/5 The best thing on the table - a homerun. French style steak frites, perfectly executed. Zero grease. Properly salted. Delightfully crisp.They were better than McDonald`s fries, which is my ultimate compliment.   Coleslaw. 2/5 A laughably teeny tiny serving, maybe 2 tsps. The taste was okay, but I wouldn`t get this again. As it was, I almost didn`t get any coleslaw THIS time.   Hush puppies, 3.5/5 There were TWO golf ball sized hush puppies and they were good.  Employees? 4/5. There`s really nothing to complain about, everyone was fairly friendly. One young lady kept the dining room clean and inquired about everyone`s food. She didn`t bother anyone and she was nice.  Drink dispenser, 4/5.  Cheerwine was on tap, so I made a cherry Pepsi. Nice!   Price? 15.xx The food was better than I expected, with decent flavor. The prices were higher than I expected, and the portion sizes were on the small side. The rent must be high here.   To the owners: I know that this type of review is not what you want to read, but I`ve eaten BBQ in a lot of places, and this is how you compare. I won`t apologize for being truthful, or pointing out short comings or meager servings for the price. That`s all on you.   Peace-N-Hominy serves decent middle of the road pork BBQ. Give `em a whirl."<2<8<2019<22<50<41

They advised me I may end up losing the tooth because it was cracked very badly. Today, I scheduled a same day urgent appointment at Canyon Modern Dentistry prepared for the loss of that tooth. The dentist and I agreed to an extraction so I sat and waited for them to '"prepare numbers'". Wow was I thrown for a loop!  1. I couldn`t be scheduled for an oral surgeon until January 26 2. My estimated fees are $925 but I could be responsible for $2,070. But they couldn`t answer that today. 3. If I wanted to schedule an appointment with the oral surgeon I would need to put down a $100 deposit on said unknown fees.  4.As I questioned more I was literally told '"let`s get you out of this seat'" and take care of things up front.  5. When I went up front I was told the doctor is giving me something for pain to hold me over until I can see the surgeon. (I didn`t ask for pain medicine) 6. When I asked what he was doing to treat the infection I believed I had I was told they`d have to ask the doctor. 7. I`m so fed up by now I just decide to leave. She hands me a script specifically saying it was for '"pain'" for amoxicillin. (At least it will help the infection) I feel like I was treated like a drug seeker and kicked out for the holiday. This dentist performed the exact same procedure, same day for my husband just a couple of years ago. I`ve had my wisdom teeth extracted and one root canal... In 37 years... I`d say that`s a pretty good track record and when a patient comes in like me, with obvious signs of infection, willing to have her tooth removed on a holiday weekend. I`m pretty sure they aren`t just there for drugs!  My daughter also goes next door to the Every Kids Dentist and we`ve had issues there too in the past with quoted fees for services suddenly changing the day of service. I know it`s the holiday, but you are a service profession. I certainly don`t want to be dealing with aftercare from an extraction for New Years, but that would have been better than having the door basically locked behind me and sending me on my way to wait for a whole month! Not to mention the fact that I absolutely feel like I`m being taken advantage of. Never again! What a waste of time and money."<31<12<2016<2<53<50

Very affordable and they do it even on the weekends and - very rare for LV - until 7pm! Food items are good but not all of them. It was my second time here and we experienced the same thing. The rockin cucumber drink is great however I always ask in a tall glass on ice as I don`t like martini glasses. It`s really good, I had more than one:) The baked crab roll and the creamy shrimp tempura are the best items on the happy hour menu. The spicy salmon cut roll, roasted shishito peppers, koi crispy rice with spicy tuna are all also good items to pick. The Kobe beef potstickers we avoid as we didn`t like them last time. I tried the edamame dumplings this time and I would never get this again, really not my thing as it`s a soft purée in a dumpling, too mushy.

They didn`t see homemade.  The kids pizza had literally no cheese. It was entirely sauce that looked like ketchup and a few specks of cheese. The caesar salad had no dressing and the portobello mushrooms had zero flavor and were covered with what felt like sand. The spaghetti was missing the mushrooms. Switched the kids pizza to kids pasta with butter and it came out hard and stuck together in some sort of pink water. I didn`t make my kid eat it. We wanted to leave as fast as possible. We left most of or meal unfinished. Fellow diners looked equally disgusted as us. I felt like I was on candid camera or something.  Take y advice and stay away.

-NMO4A4_kykDet9E5fR0Cg<dwCLkJrxOm2tv5nwOEq9jg<YuhAHVsstmDENWuZM30tMA<1<3<0<0<"Found this place on yelp after picking up my aunt from the airport . We were hungry and it  was very close to the airport so we decided to go here because we had to be somewhere by 1PM . It was 12PM and when we arrived, the restaurant was about 90% full . I understand it is lunch time and it could get really busy, but they do not how to run the business efficiency and here is why : There was only waitress running around serving food. I actually felt bad for her. The hostess lady told us'" we are full'" so we were getting ready to leave but then they got more tables out and seated us . It was 12PM when we sat down. 30 minutes went by and I kept watching the one and only waitress running in and out of the kitchen bringing food out and no one took our order. I was anxious because we need to leave by 1PM. There was a girl who walked around doing nothing so I asked her if she could take order which she replied '"I don`t do food orders, I only take drink orders '" Really? During lunch crowd and they only let one waitress doing the order taking plus bringing out orders while one is walking around not being easy and refusing to take food order? By 12:40PM the waitress finally came and took our order , so we have been waiting for 40 to just get our orders taken. 1pm came and the food was still not out and we had to get up and leave.  Terrible service and terrible operations. I don`t even know why people still come here ?"<8<11<2019<5<9<59

I`m talking everything from a Christmas cow to a Christmas swan to a Christmas Unicorn ... even a Christmas goat.)  Anyway, this task was made much easier (and more enjoyable) by a man who identified himself as '"The Original Grinch.'" His name was '"Les,'" and he was working that area of what looked like it used to be a section of the garden department or some such thing.

So many available sessions and locations for busy professionals/moms with crazy schedules.    My rating is for the Pecos Ranch site.  Office staff is quiet, helpful, not rude but not particularly welcoming/friendly.  They are always packed at the first afternoon session (only allow 2 groups and the rest are on the wait list) and they have unusual sessions times (first afternoon session is at 4:30, next session 5:45) compared to all the other sites I have been to with on-the-hour sessions, many starting at 3pm.   I love the 3pm and 4pm sessions because you can get an awesome workout in before heading home to take care of family and dinner!   I`m told hourly sessions are `too overwhelming` here.  AND the first session I attended, the trainer was late.  Awesome trainer, awesome work-out, but late.    I would hope ion the future they would try to accommodate the number of people that are signing up for the 4:30 session.  Either help trainers get comfortable managing  3 groups, add a 3:15 session, or do sessions on the hour like other locations.  Their unwillingness to accommodate the numbers despite the number of $$$$ we all pay each month is a bit frustrating.    Lastly, I must say the trainers I have worked with are great, if you can get in!  I`d be certain to change my rating to 4-5 stars if that improves!  Sadly, I often have to hit a different location to actually get my Orange in.<11<5<2016<23<52<7

Located in the Lowes plaza on Farm and Durango,  this spot finally opened up as a Shell station, but Haddies? What`s that? Another carwash? We`ve been using the Cheveon touchless wash for months due to being cautious about materials touching my vehicles, so going here for a wash never came to mind. Besides my vehicle was always too low for these types of washes.  Fast forward to 4bweeks ago, I went to do some recon and see what types of machines were being used and found out they were microfiber. The big seller was the low style conveyor belt that moves your vehicle through the wash. Ok, so I got the basic $7 wash that day. Boy was I surprised when I pulled up in front of the conveyor,  and was greeted with 2 Haddies employees with power sprayers completely presoaking the whole vehicle, taking off bugs and spraying wheels. On top of that, a pre scrub took off any gunk on the vehicle, pretty much completely washing the vehicle. Vehicle was put on the conveyor and the actual wash commenced.   After the wash, and a good drying at the end of the line, it was time for an inspection.  Let`s just say, I am now a monthly subscription owner of Haddies premium car wash for both vehicles.  It`s worth the try if you are curious, and want to get a good wash.   So fresh and so clean is all I can say.<14<7<2019<22<26<24

Mary`s instruction provided a variety of stimulating activities to do with our little ones . Each activity was the perfect amount of time , keeping our babies happy and engaged. ( our class had infants as young as 6 weeks and mine was the oldest @ 4.5 months) I loved how she explained how each practice was triggering certain development in our babies brains - even better - I could actually SEE my baby react to the activities! I was watching him discover , explore and learn.  I felt extremely connected with my son during our visit. Even when we got home, I felt like he and I were calm and content.

There were a dozen accidents from LA to the hotel so I arrived at 3 am to check in along with a flood of other guests.  Over a dozen people in line and yet they were incapable of producing additional people to help at the front desk and were limited to 2. On top of that, their computers went down and they sat there like monkeys poking at the random buttons on their keyboards without explaining to the other guests what had happened. Got to the desk after 30 minutes, exhausted, hungry, cold and wanting to check in. I provided my name, my Orbitz confirmation and my Rio confirmation numbers. They asked '"are you sure you booked here?'" No... no, I booked at the motel 6 and thought I`d trick my way onto the Rio instead. Really? They scrambled for another 15 minutes while they searched their systems and ended up with nothing.  Instead of figuring it out,  they charged me full price AGAIN for the room again while Orbitz figured out what happened and I had to walk from my room to the lobby 5 times and wait in line to try and prove that I actually made the reservations. I didn`t ever get an apology, just irritation, from them. I called Orbitz and asked then to fax over my confirmation because I didn`t trust the Rio staff to do it. Clearly they weren`t in the mood.   Booked a king, got two queens. A few of the elevators on the carnival tower kept making really loud screaming noises, which is the last thing I want to hear from a giant metal box I`m riding. The rooms weren`t too sound proof either. I know it`s Vegas but buffer the rooms, please! I`m not a kid anymore, I need sleep or I end up cranky and stupid. The music from the pool, that lively little thud, never stopped. Not once. It thudded all night, all morning and throughout the day. I like to play, but I need to recover and that was kind of the point for my getting a hotel room, otherwise I would have parked my butt on the street and just made a makeshift house from White Castle boxes.  We also asked for additional towels but we never got them.  Two days later I`m in line waiting to check out at 11 and AGAIN THEY`RE SHORT STAFFED. You would think (THINK!) that they would provide some additional attendants to deal with the 11 am check out rush. Nope.  I`m over this place. The casino is dirty, the rooms were horrible, their service was utter garbage and I don`t like paying for all of this stress when all I wanted to do was get away for a few days. Next time I`ll just stick with my White Castle box room idea.   Try the LinQ, their hotel is beautiful inside and out and it costs almost identical to the Rio.  FYI all of their restaurants inside close around 10, except their disgusting pizza stand/booth and the overpriced Voodoo lounge (which charges cover).  Rio, it was fun but all you did was leave a nasty memory like a crazy ex.  Edit: it took two weeks a dozen phone calls to Rio, Caesars Palace wholesale department, their billing department and to Orbitz but they`re FINALLY being magnanimous enough to return MY money for the double charge. I had to provide them with multiple invoices and outlined every single item so thoroughly a monkey could have figured it out."<25<5<2015<9<4<57

Their staff can be frustrating to deal with if you want anything different from how they present it. In my most recent visit for my dad`s 60th birthday, I ordered the Oreo cheesecake because he doesn`t like cake and asked for a pile of chocolate covered cherries to be placed in the center with one of those pieces of chocolate with Happy 60th Birthday Willie. This is what I got. It was delicious and not exactly what I asked for. I`ve called and asked if they could do individually wrapped chocolate dipped Oreos that I was on the hook for at the school bake sale. One would have thought I was speaking Greek in Germany. Eventually I hung up frustrated and did the work myself, this isn`t rocket science. Schools need individually wrapped treats and they dip things in chocolate...one would think other people have made this request before. Conversely, the cake I ordered for my daughters birthday was perfect. The other (Batman) cake fell apart and both were delicious.

GtaLKn6poyJl0sjEbyxVZA<o0fLKaMr30YY7sHyJdaK1Q<MAvLarZQJzj678jXsTCPFw<1<5<1<0<I have been trying to reach a supervisor for over a week. Today was my 6th time calling and leaving a message. The first time I explained the situation in detail to a front desk lady and was told the situation would be explained and emailed to a supervisor, who would then contact me back. The second time, a different lady answered the phone and told me there were no notes about my past call in the system. I explained everything again and was fed the same story. Can you guess what happened the third time? You guessed it, no notes in the system. At this point I told the lady I would not explain the situation again and to please let me speak to a supervisor. I was told no supervisor was available but that they would contact me back if I left my name and number. Today I called for the 6th time at 3pm and was told the supervisor was out on his break (yeah right). Their unprofessionalism is almost comical.  The reason I`m calling is because Budget Brothers treated our house approximately 3 years ago (correct me if I`m wrong, but either way I do admit I`m past the warranty time frame). At the time, they ended up only treating about 80% of our home, leaving two whole sides of the house untreated. I was at home at the time they did the treatment and was not told anything about this. Only upon further inspection after they left did I realize they had not dug any trenches or drilled any holes on said sides of the house. I called them several times at the time to get an explanation but they never returned my call (it is now apparent to me that it is common practice for them to ignore complaints). I was finally told by one of the ladies I spoke to last week that they hadn`t treated that side of the house because the stone pavers were on the way. After reading other reviews on here and on Google, it seems like I`m not the only one this has happened to.  To which I say, okay, the pavers being on the way is understandable, and I too understand why the worker would not want to remove them himself out of fear of breaking them and being liable. But why wasn`t I told about this while they were treating? I could have easily removed them myself in a matter of minutes. Also, the pavers are only on one of the sides that wasn`t treated. What about the other side? Anyway, as one would expect, the termites have now reappeared on that end of the house and I need to have it retreated, but I believe I shouldn`t have to pay the full price due to your mistakes and lack of professionalism. I`m not asking for any freebies, I`m just asking for you to put yourself in my shoes and understand where I`m coming from so we can come to an agreement.  As of now, I would not recommend this company to anyone. Stay away!!! I`m giving you one final chance to change my mind. My name is Ricardo Z. and I`m certain you have my number by know, so don`t ask for my address or phone number on here. My information should be sitting on Billy`s or Tasha`s desk, unless your front desk personnel is trained to ignore complaints as well.<16<11<2018<23<31<21

So glad we did! Everyone was friendly, from the beautiful young ladies at the front that seated us, to the server, and the general manager Jerry that stopped by our table. The appetizers we ordered came quickly...thank God... we only stopped in by chance bc I was too hungry to wait to go to our original destination. Beef carpaccio was ace! I ordered the brisket...fantastic mesquite flavor. I haven`t had brisket this delicious since I lived in backwoods Arkansas. Seriously! I picked up my knife to cut it, and when I went to anchor the scrumptious slab of meet I discovered no knife necessary. It was that tender! We ordered multiple sides but the crispy potatoes were my favorite. The best part... Dessert. The cheesecake was classic, simple, elegant, perfect texture. They outdid themselves on the apple pie. The crust was not too flaky, not too dry, not too moist.... literally just right. Warmed just enough to melt in your mouth, but not too hot to melt the crazy amazing almond flavored ice cream on top. I`ll definitely be returning.   Geez.... I almost forgot the best part... I love Moscow mules made with Vanilla vodka. Even though this is Vegas, I often get the same response '"I`ll have to check with the bar and let you know.'"  Not here. I ordered and the waiter said '"ok, no problem.'" He returned within just a few min with the perfectly crafted cocktail."<22<11<2019<5<44<41
-uLmZPq3mhp1DIlM0ZG-6A<K4j9UwD2CxFri8nOi8_bbA<ScBVPrkJFR4seiRQJqwGbA<1<8<0<0<Absolute trash system.  In the span of 6 months I had three different cameras fail on the same position everytime it would rain.  I guess that means I have to replace that one camera everytime it rains.  Tech support asked me to run through the same troubleshoot everytime like they are reading from a script.  The manager refused to ship me a complete replacement system and told me to return it from original place of purchase.  I asked for a customer service manager to call me because I didn`t want to be on hold but I was told I`d have to be on hold and talk to customer service first in order to get a manager to call me back.  How ass backwards is that.  Whatever you do do not purchase any type of camera system from this company.  My nvr was horribly loud ass fans, iPhone app didn`t work very well, windows flir software didn`t give me full control and on top the download from their website didn`t even display all my cameras.  I had to find an update from a random security camera forum.  All of their equipment, customer service, tech support is all trash.<13<10<2018<5<13<23

Compared to the Original Pancake House located in Rockville, Md---this Woodmere location was a disappointment.  I usually get the Apple Waffles--I was very disappointed with the amount and the way the apples were prepared compared to the Rockville location. The orange juice sizes were different and cost more than Rockville.   You would think bc it`s a chain --it would be same. NOPE.   Service: ehh it was alright. Kind of slow.<7<7<2011<4<17<14

The mac was bland. The beans had an odd seasoning in them that gave them a sour taste (vinegar maybe?). The collards were pretty good. Cornbread was also bland. The pork was tender, but I didn`t care for any of the sauces. The upside was that I pooped a car out when I got home, so that`s something.<21<11<2019<21<27<23

I`m be been here several times and the service is sub-par at best and the food is really nothing special.  I`ve had the egg and potato burrito which was A LOT more potato than egg, the corn beef hash which lacked flavor and the pancakes which were decent but then again if you can`t make good pancakes, then you should def not be open for breakfast.  The only thing I`m really impressed with are the hash browns b/c they taste awesome w/a little bit of ketchup.   I`m pretty much convinced that this place is popular b/c it`s kinda a hipster hangout and it`s new.  I love love love breakfast but I`m absolutely going to take my money elsewhere.  In fact I think I`m headed back to Barnaby`s Cafe :).<14<7<2018<17<46<49

Decent alcohol choices available. Want top shelf? 3 for $12 or 3 for $14 depending on what you want. You`ll struggle to beat these prices in Vegas.   But wait! There`s more and it comes in the form of an everything $4.99 lunch menu that is available until 5pm. They even have a good selection of items on their lunch menu and as I said everything is under $5. Go for lunch and you can leave drunk and full or just drunk, maybe just full. Whatever your preference is.   The food: the portion sizes are a bit smaller than the dinner plates which is to be expected but are still filling. I ordered the Greek chicken salad and the sirloin (only $5 why not get both right). I asked for medium and my steak was cooked correctly and well seasoned. The potatoes are a bit bland and I didn`t get much from the sauce for the steak but overall I was satisfied. As for the salad I REALLY love the dressing they put on that Greek salad. The chicken on top was pretty basic but I would order it again based on the salad dressing alone. Overall definitely worth the money and a steal if you ask me.<2<5<2019<4<17<25

When we arrived at the restraurant there was no one to greet us until a few minutes later. Then they took us to our  table and made us wait for approximately 10 to 15 minutes to take our order.  The waiters were messing around in the back leaving the customers unattended. Later on once we ordered our drinks and food they brought it to us after a long while. The chicken fajita was rubbery and extremely hard to chew. The quality of the restraurant  in general let me and my family down.<25<11<2019<4<29<31

This place is delicious and adorable!  We got there around 10:40 am on a Thursday and our wait for two was 25 minutes. We noticed that people really started coming in around 11 am so be sure to get there before that if you don`t want to wait too long! As for parking, I had to park about a 2 minute walk away by CVS because the small lot for Snooze was absolutely packed! Unless you really don`t want to walk a few extra feet, I`d recommend not even trying to get into the parking lot and parking on the street.   They offer free coffee while you wait which is a bonus in my eyes. The restaurant itself is decorated really nicely with bold colors and stylish seating. I fell IN LOVE with their colorful ceramic cups and plates! Their customer service was also really great an amazing. The server that seated us asked us if it was our first time, and said yes. After a couple of minutes of sitting down, he brought us out the pancake of the day - Espresso Chocolate - for us to try, NO CHARGE! It was delicious and I thought it made for a great first experience.  I ordered the 3 pancake stack and had the chocolate chip, pumpkin spice, and peanut butter cup pancakes. They were all delicious! Didn`t even need to add syrup. It can get overwhelming with all the chocolate so be careful when ordered chocolate pancakes.  Overall, a wonderful first experience and I look forward to my next visit!<11<12<2016<21<11<7

Long, long, long lines masquerading as '"super busy happening spot'" when almost 50% of tables are empty. The service is unfriendly and I`m being generous here. The food is, well, I think I just whipped up some of the same crap at home last week. And the strangest thing, they only carry wheat beers for their beer selections. I don`t know why that bothers me so much, but it does. So, if you want to stand in line for hours and feel like you are getting into the Pink Elephant (which was actually worth the wait btw), only to go inside to be met with bad service and eat some eggs, prepared exactly like you would at home, by all means get in line NOW! You may eat by the end of the week. And the parking situation...Don`t even get me started."<31<12<2017<19<48<11

We bought a new stove through whirlpool and when we took the masking tape off the paint came off with it! Eddie checked to make sure he could replace the panel and verified it was under warranty then ordered the part right there in front of me. I also like that I was told he would be there between 9am-9:30am and he was there at 9am on the dot.

I have been walking past their shop almost everyday on the way to class and got really excited when they soft open. They have a really cool concept, merging board games and street food. There are more than 100 games to choose from and the Game Masters make pretty solid recommendations. My friends and I managed to play two games (King of New York and SECRET HITLER!!). The Game Masters help set up your game and could teach you if you are playing the game for the first time. The decor is nice and the ambient is comfortable. If you are planning to stay long, ask for a booth seat Food wise, we ordered some Jian Bings (Chinese Crepes) and curry fish balls to share. Very tasty and authentic. I didn`t get the chicken rice but will definitely pop by later this week to try.<3<8<2019<21<10<16

The restaurant was dead.  The only people there were in the bar area or sitting on the patio.  I took my seat at the bar and the bartender walked straight over to me, not to take my order but to grab something from the well right in front of me.  As I waited, I looked around and the place looked sad and desperate.  It was like Applebee`s and Black Angus had a bastard child that they both neglected.  I noticed that the bartender was chatting up some fugly mofos  - flipping her hair and giggling like a buffoon.  At first it didn`t bother me because I knew she has to make tips.  She served two other people at the bar and when she was done I figured I`d get her attention and give her my order, even though we made eye contact and she saw me sit at the bar.  Then a third guy walks into the bar and she serves him ahead of me, it was the last straw.  I said '"f*&$ this'" and left."<3<12<2012<19<33<14

After researching surgeons and speaking to others who used Doc, I chose him to perform my surgery for a deviated septum which had been causing me problems and I am so glad I did...his years of experience and double board certification(s) were evident and contributed greatly to my successful outcome.  From the first moment I placed a telephone call to his office for a consultation until present day, he and his staff set the bar for exceptional service in the medical field.  The level of professionalism exuded by Dr. Hobgood, Ashley and Launa are second to none - you always get through on the telephone; someone is always available to answer your questions; appointment times are punctual; surgery is flawless; and paperwork is always completed without error.  Specific to Dr. Hobgood, he is the greatest....kind, confident yet realistic, positive, energetic, precise, and a person who not only takes pride in his work, but a surgeon who truly cares about his patients!  Further, he only surrounds himself with support personnel who possess and exude the same qualities he does.  If you need a septoplasty, Dr. Hobgood believes in not packing the nose post-surgery and it makes all the difference.  Quite simply, it breeds infection and it is the discomfort most people complain about.  Avoiding this makes recovery a breeze - as close to painless as you can get.  If you are considering head or neck surgery - functional, cosmetic, or both - schedule a consultation with Dr. Hobgood....You`ll be glad you did as you will be in good hands!<28<8<2018<21<49<4

This coming from someone who despises it.  The difference was the no gaggle pricing (you can ask but they will politely say no).  He took his time showing us several models.  Once we decided, we took our test drive and we were sold.  Mind you, Hi-Line is not the place to go if you are interested in test driving cars and for good reason.   They are protecting the milage on it for the future owner.    As a side note, we did test drive at another dealer and tried buying from them but found their tactics tiresome and repulsive in the end.   I mentioned Hi-Line and the salesman went into attack mode about them.  Do your homework and be informed before buying and you will realize Hi-Line is an awesome deal.    Thanks again Phillip and look forward to buying our next car from you at Hi-Line!!!!!!!<18<3<2013<2<31<14

Nothing to really write a review about, but I`ve felt positive about them maintaining my car.  They`ve lost my business as a direct result of their sales department. I received a call that they were trying to get newer models off of the lot and were willing to consider buying back my 09 Accord EX-L to get me in a 2012 EX Model. At the end of the day, the numbers didn`t really work out for both sides, which is fine. The first salesman, George, was very polite and engaging, working as hard as he could to get me the best deal possible.  Then they brought out the closer. Genetically this guy was an asshole, so I can`t put too much blame on him. At this point they may have been very desperate to get the car off the lot and started selling ideas that seemed like snake-oil. I decided I would need to take some time to make a decision if these new factors they brought in were real. I wanted to confirm feasibility and really analyze the long-term effects on my finances since this wasn`t anything I`d planned out (they called me the day before to come in). It looked like this '"closer'" wasn`t reaching his number and decided to take it out on me. He ended by offering an out-of-this-world price for my old model, saying I wasn`t driving the car off the lot that day anyway and slamming the pen down. This was after I`d made my intentions and current situation clear for about an hour. I have a car, it`s paid off, it runs fine, and I`m not desperate to start paying for a new one.  I`ve been giving my business to this company since I moved to Charlotte and don`t need to come back after getting treated like this. They maintain Hondas everywhere, guys. I hope you hire better humans in the future. As for George, keep doing you, you were great."<27<2<2015<19<22<30

I`m guessing they use decent ingredients though because it leaves our tummies happy.  Their soda is fine but the water from it is odd. It tastes kinda like plastic. If they changed over to filtered water and air ice, they would get rich   The thing that really gets me is that they have really really good salad. It`s crisp and fresh. It has good quality lettuce and veggies, with no wilt bits or brown edges. I`d say one of the best restaurant salads close by.<24<1<2019<4<18<6
Zapo6jnb6Gp4D02wfdc6qg<_h9rOf--MUWleyXAqPVo2g<5HgSU7RMELtmIHB6JQWRqA<5<0<0<0<Community Table Bistro is located in an other wise food deserted area of West Charlotte. It is part of Goodwill`s Community Campus which provides on the job training for individuals to improve and enrich their lives.  Opened in 2016, they recently went through a re-vamp which included a new look and menu. I have been a customer for years but I have to say they have ABSOLUTELY NAILED  IT with the re-opening. My favorite  item on the menu so far is The Grinder($7 & includes a side). An Italian inspired sandwich with  multiple  meats, cheese, pesto and Italian dressing. Coming in with almost 2 inches of meat and cheese in the center, this sandwich puts other sandwiches to shame!! It`s FANTASTIC!!! In fact, so fantastic that I have found it hard to veer onto other menu items. Their Signature  Fries, with a sriracha seasoning and honey drizzle, are amazing and even manage to stay crispy in a to-go order. Most know that is quite the feat. Also offered are Daily Specials. Usually consisting of a meat (think meatloaf/potroast), 2 sides and a roll, all for around $7. Speaking of $7, it`s a complete steal to pay that little for food this good. Service is always pleasant as well. Community  Table Bistro benefits so many in the area in so many ways. It is definitely  a gem in my book.<1<12<2019<22<52<6

My favorite thing about coffee club is the rotation of coffee that they have available. The wall of coffee beans for purchase is great for someone who enjoys grinding their own beans. The homemade cakes and pastries are a plus for someone with a sweet tooth and the display cases are mouth watering. This is a great place to check out if you need a fresh cup of coffee for the road or a calm and relaxing setting for a coffee date. Take a pastry or a slice of cake to go or come in for a nice lunch selection. Tim, who is the owner of the Coffee Club, will always welcome you with open arms and good hospitality. I would pick coffee club over the name brand coffee shops.<1<12<2019<21<35<30

I made the mistake of stopping in when I was STARVING - after the first bite, I realized I`d made a huge mistake but couldn`t stop eating I was so hungry! I ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl. The menu description made it sound delicious, but... the chicken was tough and chewy with very little meat inside the breading, and the rice...! It was SWIMMING in oil and there were clumps of rice that weren`t cooked at all. The vegetables seemed okay, but not fresh. When I got home - oh boy! I was so sick - let`s just say, it was severe and explosive. Never have I had a worse '"Asian'" (Americanized Asian) meal in the USA. Never."<4<12<2019<19<34<11

aAy1dF4ImKr67hshqjX1yA<uQgtRJgXp3DvgneAns0HaA<xtYiHTmunjfCN2sUaQxBjA<1<0<2<0<"Booked 3 nights for labor day weekend. The room was ok but VERY out dated.  Reserved a strip view and we could only see like 4 of the strip casinos at one of the ends. Not the view we expected.  Check in was terrible it took us an hour in line to get our keys. The supervisor was the one who checked us in. We had a food credit and I had to remind her of it at first cause she had already given me my keys and never even brought it up. Once I brought it up she said oh ok let me look oh yeah you do have a food credit.....I asked where could we use it and she specifically said at Starbucks AND Hash house a Go Go $18 a day, she even had me write it down on my receipt and spelled out the restaurant name for me to write it. She even mentioned how the plates were very big servings and we could easily share so we wouldnt go too much over the $18. So we wanted to take advantage of the credit and went to the hash house for breakfast. I did ask at the restaurant before we were seated if they took the credit and no one knew just said to ask the waiter when he took our order. I asked him and he didn`t know either just said to mention it at check out. When its time to pay of course they wouldn`t take the credit. I went to the registration area to complain and the lady that helped me was SO rude and said yeah well the paper clearly states your credit is only for starbucks. And kept saying that over and over and rolling her eyes at me. I didn`t care what the paper said, that`s not what the '"supervisor '" told me. I asked for the manager and she was useless too and unwilling to help. They obviously rather loose a customer over $18. She Only said she had to speak to the supervisor first to ask her what happened that night of my check in and she would call me back and did she call me, of course NOT. So they pretty much tell you you can use the credit at Hash House just to get you in there and after it`s time to pay oh look at that you`re out of luck and have to pay the entire bill out of pocket!!! Thieves!!! I would have never gone to eat there if it wasn`t for their straight out lie!!! Customer service is Terrible at registration they are rude and treat you like you don`t matter.

And, it is hard to go wrong with either Mashed Potatoes and Gravy or golden Potato Wedges.  This time I opted for the deep-fried potatoes and went with a to-go order of 10 pieces of Extra Crispy Chicken, substituting 1 breast for a thigh, and adding $!.00 to the price of the value bucket meal.

Perhaps I might show some of my paper work of how you guys dropped me like yesterday`s garbage! Well I did win my case and through some very Amazing People from Jackson White Law. They were great/friendly/understanding, ( no truthfully) they were patient because they understand they are dealing with people with disabilities, something you people tend to forget. Don`t bother spewing your normal response about how and why most people get dropped and that you have a buisness to run because that is apparent. How dare you ask people not to come into your office because of germs being spread, you are a public buisness and as such are obligated to cator to people or offer services out of that office/building because that is how it is listed, furthermore as a disability Lawyer you ought to know that some people suffer with mental health issues that can range from anxiety/confusion/memory loss and even learning disabilities which all would perhaps help aid into reasons people seek (in person interaction.)

My friend and I used to come here every week after work a year ago and the food was never amazing but it was much better then my last visit. Now the lunch menu items aren`t even tolerable. Trust me I understand that you get what you pay for and this isn`t a 5 star Gordon Ramsay kind of deal but damn I wouldn`t give this food to my dog. I ordered the lollipop wings which they downsized from 8 to 5, yes they are a little bigger in size but they were dry, cold and tasteless. I was wondering why they came out so fast almost as soon as I ordered. They must have been a mistake sitting there in the window and they just brought them out to me rather then waste them. I also got the pasta which I`ve always ordered and there was no chicken in it. You now have to pay extra to add meat. The pasta wasn`t even hot it was barely warm and the noodles tasted old and crunchy. My friend had the salmon and it was cold and plain as well. These were literally frozen dinner meals put on a plate. The food was disgusting and the service was horrible as well. The bartender serving us had an attitude and they charge for everything. I wanted ranch, most restaurants don`t charge  but a few do so I understood that however I asked for lemons for our water and he proceeded to say that was an extra charge as well. Excuse me??

I had been transferred from Mountain View hospital to have an abscess on my mandible (lower left jaw). When the PA in the ER called Dr.Keeley at around 2am to ask about if she felt surgery was needed.  She fit me in and had me scheduled to be in pre op by 7:30am. Not only was she such good energy but she understood how to be a calming soul.  Six days after surgery I had my follow up at her office my appt was scheduled for 2pm but at around 1:30 I received a call from Ruby to let me know there was a delay and that she would call when it was about 20 mins before . Honestly I found that to be five star especially since I live so far away.  When I arrived at 3:20 I was seen very quickly, Tia (sorry if spelling is off ) took time to make sure I voiced all my concerns and asked about my pain level and made sure all questions were answered .  Dr. Keeley checked me out , aligned and related about my experience and hooked me up with an holistic essential oil to numb the part of my throat that was hurt by the intubation tube.  I have had PTSD trauma in my past with office staff but Dr.Keeley has folks that radiate the same positive energy of her.  Now please keep in mind she is good at what she does and kind but that also means she may have more emergency issues like myself that cause delays.  I`m a fan of not dumping opiates into my body so I didn`t even ask for anything so if you need pain management idk how that works but in Vegas Goodluck to you.. I love that she has something natural to numb my issue without supporting big pharma..  Either way I feel this is a five star experience and my incision`s and jaw are doing really well.

My roommate adopted 2 kittens with special needs from the SPCA. The special needs aspect was that one was an abused cat who refuses human interaction, and the other kitten is going blind. When they were adopted the second kitten was sneezing and we were advised that if the sneezing continues to bring her back for treatment. As two students who work, we were unable to bring the kitten to the SPCA in the 5 days following her having issues due to their hours and our availabilities. We did however contact them to report the problem and ask how to go about it and were told we needed to bring the kitten back in.   When the weekend came and we contacted them we were informed that it was day 17, 2 days past their '"warranty'" of sorts, even though they had already been informed of the problem a week earlier and knew that we would only bring the kitten on the weekend - they never said '"well your warranty ends in 3 days so you can`t bring her this weekend'".   At this point the kitten is still sick from an illness that the clinic was aware of her having when they allowed us to adopt her, without supplying treatment and are refusing to treat her even though they were fully engaged by us on two occasions prior to '"expiration date'" and advised us to come whenever we could. On top of that, the infection has spread to my older cat of 18 years who may now have to be put down because of the recklessness of the SPCA`s staff."<5<12<2015<16<57<0

I asked him to come and look over everything because we had a lot to be moved, he said no, he didn`t need to, he charged per truck load. We had to change moving days because of buyers closing date being held up, but Sincear worked with us and gave us a great price and finally we were able to set a time and day for the move and we told him we had to be out that day because new buyers were to start moving in that evening. He said there would be no problem, he would be sending 4 men and 2 trucks to get us moved. The price he quoted was $675 per truck load, $85 for materials, which didn`t apply because they used our plastic wrap and a 10% discount for veteran. Morning of move: 1. They were late, over 2 hours 2. Only 3 men with 2 trucks. 3. We owned a business so we had tubes of wrapping material so they used ours to wrap everything. 4. They were fast, moving lots of boxes first, had to keep telling them lots of boxes were marked FRAGILE, very expensive collectibles, but some were tossed on truck. 5. New mattresses were not wrapped and corners got dirty and damaged. 6. They took care to wrap and pad bedroom furniture and some of the other furniture but then they ran out of padded blankets. They kept getting calls that they had to go to another job, but I told them they had to get my move done first since we had to be out that evening. They were very upset with their boss because he was expecting them to be done and booked more for them then they could handle. I felt bad for them, they were under a lot of pressure.  7. They had run out of blankets and we still had lots of nice furniture to move and they wouldn`t take the time to go get more, so they just wrapped in plastic wrap. 8. They got 1 truck loaded and started the other truck and they still had lots to load from inside home and outside patios and sheds, it was getting dark. 9. After the 2nd truck was 1/4 loaded they decided to move and unload the first truck to our new home, so off we went.  10. They were working very fast, not careful at all. Moved all bedroom furniture into bedrooms and didn`t assemble beds. 11. When moving couch they broke the long side zipper of the cover. He tried to fix it but zipper were pulled out, couldn`t fix.He took picture. 12. When they brought large dining table in and placed it in the dining room, I almost cried, they hadn`t wrapped it at all and it was deeply scratched on top in many places and along the edges, I haven`t looked at the base yet because of all the boxes and stuff around it. 13. One curio cabinet has legs that came off. 14. We found boxes of food under boxes in garage, they didn`t bring them into kitchen, boxes were marked. 15. We told them to put all things marked garage in the garage and all things for house inside, but they just piled things, nothing in order, just all over, things were thrown on top, not caring what went where. 16.They brought the big safe thru the front door, it fell and pinned one of the men. It took the other two to lift it off him. His arm was hurt so bad he was crying. Someone picked him up and took him to the hospital, thank God we heard it wasn`t broken. The other 2 men finished unloading the truck, putting boxes anywhere they could find a spot. 17. Job ended for the night, it was very late. 18. We had to sleep on mattresses on the floor that night.  NEXT  DAY: 19. They had to do a small job and arrived mid morning. Buyers were already moving in, what a mess. 20. I got there early and was moving all our things left in home to one area in front room to try and keep everything divided from theirs. Also moved a lot of stuff to garage and loaded my car. Patio furniture was still on patios and stuff in sheds needed to be moved. 21. All three men showed up, one in an arm splint. they said they had to hurry because they were suppose to be at another job. They loaded some of the stuff onto the trunk that was already 1/4 loaded and said they had to unload and come back to finish, it was noon already. They could have gotten everything on that truck. They unloaded and we came back for the 3rd load. When they got to our home with the last small load they piled and threw everything here and there, we couldn`t even close our garage door. They moved a few pieces of patio furniture to the back but some was buried in the garage.  22.We paid with a chase card and agreed to 3 truck loads plus tip for men. Man said total was 1733.40 and I said to make it an even $2000 so the men got a tip. Sincear charged our card with $2733.40, a $733.40 over- charge. Chase Bank is handling this for us. I called and talked to Sincear on Monday and told him about all of the above and he assured me he would fix everything and get back to me on Wednesday after he returned from Calif. He has never called or returned any of my calls (4) since. Would never recommend or use this company again.<7<8<2019<21<18<13

Group of 6 enjoyed their version of a jalapeño and bacon app that was pretty good although I looked nothing like the pix on line but still pretty tasty.   A couple folks at the table enjoyed the burnt ends as recommended by our server who was a very good server. I wish I would have remembered his name ( bigger middle age guy who must be pumping the iron). He had the just right level of interaction and was very attentive without being over the top.   Being on a Keto plan I had the salmon salad which I thought was the star of the show!  The only thing I would consider on changing was the crinkle cut el cheap fry. I did not taste them due to Keto but noticed those that had them didn`t eat many of them.   Highly recommend if you want some good que or a damn good salmon salad.<19<8<2019<20<23<6

The place is dark and smells of liquor so it`s certainly more bar than it is a restaurant from the atmosphere. We ordered mini tacos and mini chimichangas with beans and rice which all were well prepared and enjoyed by the team. Having grown up in Arizona Phoenix specifically,  there are plenty of choices for solid Mexican food but I remember the TP that is in the other location as being a staple in our meal time adventures. I only gave it 3 stars because the reality is our options that we selected would have been difficult to screw up but they were quick to prepare and friendly enough when we picked up the takeout. The salsas were delicious though a little mild for the Hispanic team members who have a more spicy appetite for chilies.<16<9<2019<4<35<23

They have guns, ammo, hunting and archery stuff.  Clothing, fishing and hiking stuff.  Shoes and boots.  They have stuff for your dogs.  They sell candy and fudge and have a restaurant upstairs that I finally tried after many years and it was pretty good.  I guess if you like to sit around and do nothing this may be a place you wouldn`t like.  If we ever have an open day with no plans we go to Cabela`s to look around - hard to leave with nothing.  We have bought a couple of guns here, gear for our last camping trip and life vests and stuff for the dogs for our last four wheeling trip as well.  My son used to love to come here when he was little as well to look at the fish aquarium and animal exhibits.  Someone posted about not getting help and minerals employees (I don`t know what a mineral employee is) but we have always gotten help - they even ask you when you come in the door if you need anything.  We have a Cabela`s card and have gotten two free guns just off of the points from the card - seriously, what is not to like?<17<2<2017<0<41<31

GIF8emU9OM7lsbF8OHN2gg<KxHWscxRPEQ7GySTpWLdrw<wTpxQJoHqIPnKk9_IgLXLA<5<4<0<0<Javan runs the business, and is the business: He knows cars, deeply. Most any place you go to see cars, you find out as soon as you try to learn something about them that nobody in the whole dealership really knows anything, or cares. Javan does know, from the details of luxury cars you won`t find in the manual, to useful insights on what car issues matter, and the best way to fix them, such as he has for me when working on a trade-in, and on a purchased car. You wind up saving a lot of money, getting the job done right, and being very happy you met Javan.  I have a great mechanic, and I like him a lot. I`ve known him for ten years, and he`s owned his own shop for much longer. But Javan and his mechanic are every bit as on the ball, even more clever when it comes to smart fixes, and cost less. Much less.  When you go to German Auto House, there is no pressure. You are presented with every option, so that you can make a fully informed decision, but your decision belongs to just you. You can look at many cars, or only two or three, drive them, look at their complete CarFax, even take them to your mechanic. If you are serious, Javan is serious, and just as good at doing business as he is with the cars themselves. Better, even -- I don`t know how he gets such good cars, with such a great ownership history, and in so many in such excellent condition!  You look around for used cars, and you discover some things. One large used car outlet, which rhymes with CarFax, seems to sell only cars that have a lien against them, and have very poor maintenance histories (those two seem to go together). Dealers may have good finds, but they charge too dang much for what they offer. Craigslist is interesting, but full of crazy people, and you never really know what you`re getting. Javan, interestingly, can tell you something about the history of every car, and can back it up with documentation. I don`t think he makes much on a given sale, but I think he makes it back in loyalty and word-of-mouth. Which has got to mean hard work, but that is what he does. I have never seen anyone do it better.  Javan`s style is plainspoken -- what a relief! He`ll answer your question with the actual answer. And, it is the truth; when you work with him you find out that the only way he does business is truthfully, because nothing else makes sense. If you are in the market to actually buy a car, well, it is hard to imagine anyone better to do business with.  I have traded in, and I have purchased, and I am now on the way to a second purchase from German Auto House. I have had bad times and good times at a dozen car dealerships over the years, but except for my mechanic and for Javan, I have never worked with anyone on a car or car purchase who I ever came to truly respect. This is why I am buying from Javan, again.<8<12<2016<3<53<36

Super fresh, and we got to watch them make our pizza in the brick oven! We ordered the Biaggia pizza off the lunch menu, and it was topped with figs, prosciutto, cheese and arugula.

yFwASk0pCD_wjYgscGe0jw<SJ6zBKHcoNVc5WPkO9p6xA<p37gJHffidefQwEvXWhfbQ<1<2<0<0<"I walked out of there crying, and no I didn`t get the facial. Let me start with that.  This review is for their customer service only. I bought a Groupon for 3 facials. I called and made an appt. they`re so busy that the appt was given to me for almost two months later. I realized later I wasn`t gonna be able to make it so I called to reschedule. It was closed or they were busy so I left a message. Someone called me back and I rescheduled for this appointment the review is about.   I walked in at 12:50, my appt was at 1:00pm. The girl that was there was alone talking to a customer. She looked over to me with zero interest and said I`ll be right with you. It`s 1:05 at this point so I go over and ask her '"is there a bathroom I can use in the meantime?'" And she said '"yes, I`ll take you back in just a second, as soon as I`m done'" which I assume she means she`ll take me back to the room for my facial, I tried to walk to the bathroom and she stopped me and said '"I`ll take you back when I`m done'" so I realize I misunderstood and I go sit down. The lady finally leaves and this girl looks over to me and says '"was there anything you needed; anything you wanted to ask about?'" With this awkwardness like I`m not supposed to be there. I tell her I have an appointment and she acts shocked, she says '"here? Have you been here before? No I haven`t seen you here before... '" and she`s busy rambling quietly as she looks in the book. I`m Latin, look 10 years younger than I am and she`s acting like I`m in the wrong place. That`s when I realize she`s profiling me and she doesn`t think I belong in their fancy skin care establishment or that I can be left alone to walk to the bathroom in case I do something. I bartend on the strip and I model for a spirits brand, I really didn`t walk in there looking sketchy or dangerous, I was nice and polite the whole encounter. That`s why her treatment to me was so unexpected to the point that I almost didn`t even catch it as it was happening because you don`t treat people this badly when they`re nice to you.  It went back and forth with her telling me I must be mistaken because I`m not in the system and I don`t have an appointment. I asked her to check for my name and last name, in Groupon vouchers, in calls to be returned because someone had already called me back when I tried to make my appt but she still says she doesn`t see me anywhere ever. It starting to get awkward but I ask her to check one more time and she finds me in the Groupons. I was at least half right but she still says no appointment. Mind you, it`s 1:20. I ask her for a solution; do I reschedule or what because I`m tired of standing there trying to figure out why they don`t have any record of me ever calling and making not one but 2 appointments in the last few months. She says the next availability is the end of March, and I say it`s too far and she starts pushing for me to contact Groupon and get a refund. I`m surprised and I tell her I`ve been waiting months for this facial and that I would rather reschedule so I ask if they have a cancellation list or something. But she keeps going on about contacting Groupon because I must be mistaken since I didn`t make an appointment there. I even said do you guys have a second location? Because I`m so confused and I can`t believe she`s so sure that I never called. Which is so rude, is this really the best solution? She didn`t ask for my phone number; she didn`t say we`ll check and contact you back to see what happened because obviously the client is being adamant about having called and spoken to someone, she didn`t offer for me to speak to anyone else. Is there no tiny possibility that I may be right? At this point she`s treating me like a second class citizen and is clearly annoyed so I tell her '"I`m sorry but you keep treating me like it`s my fault that you guys don`t have any record of me ever calling or having made 2 appointments. I assure you I called because I waited months for this facial. If the appt wasn`t today that`s possible, but I definitely called. I looked you guys up and I`ve been waiting to come here for this. I know I called and I know I spoke to someone here twice.'" Because really I just thought it was so bizarre. She`s annoyed and she just starts looking down at the counter waiting for me to shut up. Then she says a refund is the best solution and that she will make sure to tell Groupon to honor the refund.   I was so surprised and so uncomfortable and offended that tears started rolling down my eyes, and I just started to walk out. She realized I`m crying and just said not to worry and to contact Groupon for the refund.  It`s been a few days and still no one contacted me from there about the incident or my appointment."<5<2<2019<4<52<5

puhK0ahi3FkTEpPulsqCQA<N1SRDhbaevbQZc0NleHUCA<X87VvzDneI2fGXyT0NmZIA<1<0<0<0<"I`m shocked. My wife and I had a few amazon returns and dealt with Carol the Manager at this UPS store. Very simple, and very quick 5 minute interaction with the non manager girl that was working, then it all turned bad when Carol got involved. I asked Carol who sets the fee for printing a return label, since it`s not even close to a competitive fee at $2.75. She said the store owner. Ok cool. That`s fine. Every business should be able to price heir services however they want... but when I was walking out of the store Carol says '"un fucking believable.'" The door was halfway closed behind me,  it I heard it clear as day so I walked back in the store and asked her what she said, and she repeated it again. There was a mother with two kids inside the store that were at the counter and had to hear this '"manager'" and her potty mouth, not once but twice.   I tried to de-escalate the manager Carol by telling her that the girl that helped us for 5 minutes was very helpful, and courteous. I didn`t expect Carol to drop another curse word, for the 3rd time, in front of other customers, but she did! She was clearly beyond de-escalating so I said, '"I`m going to leave, I`m sorry you`re upset, have a good day.'" Then walked out before she could curse anymore.   I absolutely hope the store is audio and video recorded to back up my story. The owner should have a very real talk with this manager. If I was recording the incident on my phone it could be a viral video. The liability this manager created this UPS store, and the reputation of UPS as a company is overwhelming. UPS clearly needs to have customer service training. There is no reason for any manager to lash out to a customer with cuss words, let alone in front of other customers, with or without children. Disgusting! She needs to be coached on how to deal with customers.   This left felt entitled to a $2.75 fee to literally print a piece of paper. All I said to her was '"this isn`t even a competitive fee, the library charges 10 cents per piece of paper.'" But she felt some kind of way about doing me and my wife a service (her job) that she is paid by her boss to do.   Wow! I`m just totally rambling now because I`m just so shocked that this lady would act that way! I really want to go back inside that store with like a Starbucks gift card or something. She needs to take a chill pill if she gets this worked up over nothing. Maybe she gets upset customers all the time. Maybe tons of people complain about that fee. If so, then maybe the store owner should consider changing that fee. This lady shouldn`t have to deal with customers being charged a ridiculous fee that the owner set, to profit off the amazon return process. I understand it`s only $2.75, and if $3 bucks is gunna make or break someone that we got bigger problems, but the issue with 3 bucks for literally 1 piece of paper is where the issue is.   It took 1 minute to email the label, print it, cut it, and stick it in the bag. Having the label already for UPS is free, so that`s the issue."<24<9<2019<18<18<10

I have called them for maintenance issues and each time someone has responded either the same day or within 24 hours. Yes there have been 2 occasions where estimates for repairs were needed, but they never missed an appt and repairs completed within 5 days. Air conditioning done the same day. Worked with Waypoint agent Jan Torres to find a second rental. The advantage in working with their agent is you can see vacant homes promptly before they can be seen by outside agents. Then I worked with Jenneal Bell through the rental process. Very professional and assisted me in getting the closing rental cost for my present rental so no extra monies were taken out.  Would recommend this company.<26<9<2016<18<51<5

Luckily, we saw it before we stepped on it with our bare feet. My mom was quick to pick it up with a napkin and throw it in the trash. We were rushing to get to dinner so we didn`t have time to call downstairs and tell them about it until the next day, and they didn`t even pretend to care... They brushed it off saying it was too late for them to do anything about it... I don`t think they would have cared any more or done anything differently if we called any sooner...    *We were woken up by a couple fighting very loudly in the hallway... They were out there for a quite a while... I understand Vegas gets crazy, but what little sleep I`m able to get, I`d like to get without hearing people`s loud but boring arguments.  *No restock of toiletries when room was cleaned.

Don`t know why but we always seem to end up at the Forum Shops and stopping at this Fields of Dreams shop (more like Fields of Disaster).  Our last trip there, my son and his friend wanted to get a souvenier.  They`re big baseball fans.  My son`s friend accidentally bumped into a display upstairs and a framed/signed plaque fell over and the glass broke.  The two rudest salespeople demanded we pay for the broken plaque at $129.99.  Are they out of their minds?  We demanded to talk to the owner, but he was off and too busy to deal with it, leaving two dumb girls to call the police.  Police came and we explained the whole situation and showed them the flimsy display.   Needless to say, we did not pay for that plaque.  I guess when you have two dumb, rude people working at a store the best thing to do is to bring in somebody with a brain.  I guess this is their way of moving inventory.

I am a cheap shopper, so Last Chance has the lower prices, but like I have said before, the product can be a bit beaten up.   At The Rack it is a much more relaxed environment, way more organized, and the staff is so much more help full. I usually like to shop for shirts, dresses and jackets here. They also have a great selection of shoes, underwear, and pants, all a bit out of my price range though. Last week I found the greatest find! I found the best pea coat ever! It is black with double buttons and a belt, not too long and it has pockets in the perfect place. The best part, it was originally $160, their price was $59.95 AND all their wool coats we 25% off. Score! Now I will be warm in this Arizona winter. Haha   Check them out. The parking lot can be crazy this time of year, but what parking lot isn`t.

LG2Q6Y60g3MgCe9z9ZhmEg<8KWR1qLgN2rTZ4VSGW9yvg<z8f6XGLjXORiP83e1ulOKg<1<0<0<0<"Ice dispenser auger motor for Kenmore 2017-model refrigerator failed in early 2019 & Sears Home Repair was contacted via telephone.   They advised a $99 fee to come to home to diagnose the problem.  They were informed that the specific problem was known already - motor that turns the ice augur which spins & releases ice cubes or crushes ice needed to be replaced.   Sears Home Service advised that if that was indeed the issue, the $99 troubleshooting-fee would be deducted from the repair/replace cost if Sears Home Service was used to perform the work that day.    This was agreed-to, and an appointment was made for 15 August 2019.    Tech showed-up on-time and was very friendly & professional.  He was advised exactly what the problem was, issue was demonstrated to him, and he spent time removing the ice auger motor, confirming that it was indeed burned-out - '"Found bad augur motor replaced it'" are the service technician`s notes listed on my receipt.  Total estimate to replace the motor was $ 537.11!!!   That is extremely high, and broke-down to $175.42 for parts, and $361.69 for labor (including the $99 '"Diagnostic Fee'").  Keep in-mind that this is for a refrigerator that`s only about 2 years old, and while I didn`t buy it, the refrigerator has no-frills besides the ice maker/dispenser and I`m guessing it cost less than $1000.      The service tech had no input on the fees - he simply entered data into his smartphone and Sears Home Service`s computer responded with the total cost.   Removing the old motor and replacing it with a new one were a very straightforward process and total labor time to do the physical work (minus talking with me, etc.) was under 30 minutes.  Charging $361.69 for less than 30 minutes labor is utterly insane, and simply for that reason, I will never buy a Sears Kenmore appliance nor use Sears Home Service again.   I reluctantly paid the amount via my credit card after approval from my landlord (who was also shocked at the expense, but the work did need to be done).  Shortly afterward, I received an automated email from Sears Home Service (noreply@shs.com) that provided an itemized payment receipt for the work that had been done & paid for with my credit card.     Upon discovering that the $99 '"Diagnostic Fee'" wasn`t ever deducted from the repair bill total, I called Sears Home Service on their WATS line, on 29 August 2019.     I had a printout of the payment receipt that they`d emailed me, and despite having the service date, a '"Service Order Number,'" the service address, phone #, etc. on the bill, the customer-service agent I spoke with - '"Josh,'" who had an extremely thick Indian accent making it very difficult to understand him, could not find the account, and thus, couldn`t help me at all!  How idiotic is it to call Sears Home Repair customer service, give them the exact-same Customer Information and even the Service Order # that`s on the receipt that Sears Home Service emailed you, and yet to be told by Sears Home Service that they cannot find you in their system, thus aren`t able to help you...   I was on the phone with '"Josh'" from 8:21-8:33PM and it was a complete waste of time.  '"Josh'" wasn`t helpful or sympathetic - '"I can`t find you in our system'" is all he could do.  No suggestions, no forwarding my call to a supervisor, etc.    I later logged-on to their web page to try to find my record and log a complaint, and it would seem like the Service Order Number that my receipt shows is missing a digit ('"Josh'" was oblivious to that).   So unless I challenge the credit-card payment or can actually speak to an intelligent person at Sears Home Service, I`m screwed AGAIN - not only can I not get the $99 Diagnostic/Service-Call fee waived like they said they`d do, but if the ice auger motor fails during the paltry 3-month warranty it came with (537.11, for something that only comes with a 3 month warranty...), I cannot even have it repaired under warranty, since THEY apparently screwed-up on the Service Order # that THEY sent me in-writing!  I will be contacting the Better Business Bureau and some state regulatory agencies to file complaints.  STAY-AWAY FROM SEARS HOME SERVICES, which is the brand-name & logo for Transform SR Brands LLC, based in Illinois!!"<1<10<2019<23<47<12

Called to set up an appointment, and they helped me find a day that works with my schedule.  Went there right on time for my schedule, and Melinda checked me in. She offered me snacks or drinks, which was really nice. Their interior was very pretty and cozy looking. She explained to me how their membership work and i told her that I wanted to try it first and if i end up liking it, i`ll sign up after i got the treatment.   I went in and Marie did my Hydrafacial and explained everything to me. She asked me what my skin concern was and she gave me what will help them from my Hydrafacial.   After the treatment, my skin looked like a glass. My skin was so nice for about a week. I recommend getting Hydrafacial when you have an important day coming up and you want to look your best.  I signed up for their membership of 6 months for $80 and according to their facial menu, i`ll get EXPRESS hydrafacial or other treatment on the list. Not sure how this is this different from the first regular Hydrafacial that i got that day.  Will be coming back soon to get my second hydrafacial and i`m looking forward to it!

I waited to write my review after trying various items on the menu.   Korean-inspired dishes are pretty tasty and are pretty greasy. Kimchi fried rice has an overpowering kimchi flavor, but the kimchi as an accompaniment is welcome in the other rice dishes. Opt for the bulgogi nachos or bulgogi rice bowl if you`re looking for something tasty. I like the rice bowl because it comes with a vinegar-based cold slaw, mixed greens, warm rice, kimchi, and protein of choice all under a sunny-side up egg. The flavors and temperature variation mesh well to provide a well-balanced meal.   While there are no lunch specials, the prices are average and won`t break the bank, especially if you pay with cash to receive the discount. While this isn`t my favorite location, I`m always happy to come here for a bite to eat.<15<10<2017<2<56<8

Which is stated in the contract you sign with them. This is because the plow needs clearance so its not scraping the heck out of your driveway. If you have gravel, they need 4 inches. Recently, we have had enough snow and they have been plowing with no issue. Even today, we contacted them to see when they would plow and he said that they were waiting till 5 because that`s when the next storm would hit and they didn`t want us to have a snowy drive after they just got done plowing. I feel obligated to post this review because this is a small family owned company and bad reviews like the ones below can really hurt them.

The girl that brought out my sushi dropped off the plate and I followed up with telling her I`d like to place to an order for an additional roll. She told me, '"I don`t  take orders'" and walked off. It would have to been to easy to say '"sure I`ll get your waiter for you'".   As for the sushi, I felt the product was fresh, and the portion of rice for the nigiri were perfect.    We ordered the '"Monster Roll'" and felt that it was just to big to enjoy all of the ingredients. It would be a little better if the roll was smaller in diameter and just longer instead of jamming all of the ingredients into a larger diameter roll. So when you bite this thing you only get half of the flavor and the rest crumbles all over the plate.    The '"Salmon Lover'" roll was delicious...

We went for the late '"Social Hour'" and didn`t know that we`d be treated to live music. This doesn`t always make me happy, since to me, restaurants are for socializing, and live music makes that impossible so much of the time. It`s usually ear-splitting and conversation becomes impossible. Even worse, it makes people at other tables have to shout, too. But not this time: Zack is a solo guitarist and singer, and I was in awe of his ability to segue from country to music of my generation, then even to blues and jazz. I was transported almost back to my guitar-playing days in Greenwich Village, then back to the present, with all stops in between. I had such a fabulous time!!!!!  Now on to the food/drink: Though a little disappointed that only dry white wines were HH-priced, I ordered a Cosmo for only $5, which was beautifully presented, tasty, and generous with the alcohol. I was also a little sad to learn that the menu from the earlier HH is substantially reduced at the later hour. The pizzas are still there, but the sliders and a few other choices are missing. Not wanting to make a meal out of spinach dip, I decided to order the Turkey Pastrami Stack from the regular menu. I didn`t want fries, but got the other choice - the cole slaw - as my side. Our waiter, Joseph, was wonderful and wonderfully patient. When my sandwich came out (with fries), the turkey was topped with a mound of cole slaw - and then he brought my cole slaw side! I don`t like cole slaw *that* much! He cheerfully told me I could get a side salad instead, and it was a pretty one, with cherry tomatoes and also some heirloom cherry tomatoes. My sandwich was over-the-top delicious - and big. I was stuffed.  My husband had a nice lager on tap, and one of those gigantic pretzels, so big that he couldn`t finish it. Joseph packed it to go, and put in two containers of the stone-ground mustard.  We were parked all the way back, in the covered parking at the very end of the casino. As we got to the rearmost door, Herb realized he`d forgotten to take his doggy bag, so he went back to the restaurant, no mean feat for a guy who`s still recovering from major surgery. It had already been thrown out, and they graciously made him a whole new one, complete with two containers of mustard.

Deo6-SrXy7Y00m6KoZ9mWw<vznM45ouB2rjBdRp1qxcRg<GqfGoFMC3cn_AZI7iUOWKg<1<1<1<0<"Came on a Sat night at around 11. I`ve been to other bar Louie`s in other cities and enjoy their food and drinks. This place needs some work. The food and drinks are good but service is terrible.  It was about half full when we arrived but all the unoccupied tables were mostly dirty. We finally found a clean one and waited 15 min to get acknowledged. The waitress finally said she`d be right over but we waited another 10 min. Finally after taking our order we noticed she went to other tables for 10+ min before even putting in our drink order at the bar. By the time we got our first drink we had been sitting over 50 min. I wanted to leave but my wife convinced me to stay. Meanwhile not a single table was cleared.. A massive party had left before we arrived and there was still food and drinks and a general mess the entire time we were there.. My '"favorite'" comment I overheard was another table get their drinks on a to go cup due to there being no clean glasses. Probably because they were all dirty and sitting at tables still.   I wish I could say it got better but it did not. I can appreciate a friendly and chatty waitress but she was doing it at the expense of service. She appeared to know people at another table and spent her whole time socializing with them while being short with us. When our drinks did finally come she even commented how '"hopefully you`ll be happier now'". Kind of rude if you ask me. I only complained once that we had been waiting forever. When we were ready to pay I literally wanted to give her my card right then and there to get out of there and she was like '"oh I`m gonna drop this off and be right back'".. Needless to say she never returned. Luckily I had the right amount of cash in my pocket so I walked over and handed it to her so she would realize I was annoyed.   The manager (I think) did stop by and we complained about how slow stuff was and he seemed like he would do something but nothing changed. I don`t think anyone working there cares at all.   It`s a shame because the food and drinks here are really good but the place is not run well. It was dirty and slow."<8<9<2019<18<48<1

Lately, our orders have been quite messed up and the meat has been so dry. We`ve been going less and less to Capriotti`s and the minimal times that we`ve gone, we`ve been disappointed. Every time we order our Philly cheesesteaks there`s always something missing that we asked for and I decided to try the new chicken chipotle crunch and it was so dry. I still have a special place in my heart for Capriotti`s as one of the better sandwich places but lately it hasn`t been doing it for us. Hopefully it goes back to the way we love it or it was just a couple mess ups which happen.<31<7<2019<18<51<39

I came in this morning for a pedicure. While the guy (Leon) was working on my pedicure sat down to get started I looked down and he had a huge hole in his pants exposing himself. I let the owner know if I could get someone else to finish up due to the inappropriateness of what just happened. They all kinda laughed as he was told about the situation, I did not get an apology from him as he was leaving. I barely got an apology from the owner. This is by far the worst experience I`ve had at any nail salon. They are being very nonchalant about the whole situation. This is a place where people bring their kids and they allow people to come in here dresses so inappropriately. The owners and employees should really know better than to show up to work with ripped clothes. I feel extremely violated by this experience. They also wanted me to still pay after this whole thing. I refused to pay and was told by the lady in there that he didn`t know his clothes was torn and I just wanted to get free service. This place and the employees are horrible people<19<10<2019<18<0<18

It came with pulled pork, ribs, brisket and two sides (coleslaw & baked beans).  I thoroughly enjoyed the brisket. It was tender, moist and flavorful. I also enjoyed the ribs. The caramelizing on the outside added to the experience. The pulled pork had too much of the broth in it and it took away from the flavor. The coleslaw was phenomenal. It was crispy and had just the right amount of '"tang'" to it.. The beans were good but had just a bit too much pepper for my taste.  While I have been to a number of Dickie`s BBQ restaurants, they typically follow the same general formats. This establishment was clean, friendly, helpful, the food was very good, and Really enjoyed my lunch. I will be back for sure!"<3<9<2019<5<17<6

I have a very small mouth, which many dentists have complained about, but he doesn`t and he is very gentle.  His staff is great.  It is a very friendly, relaxed environment.  His little dog is very cute and friendly.  He doesn`t try to sell you dental services that you do not need, like other dentists in the area.  I`ve had a lot of dental issues throughout my adult life as a result of radioactive iodine, and I have seen a lot of dentists.  Dr. Ngo is by far the best.

When I called, they said it was a $75 trip charge which would be applied to the bill if I had them do the repair.  However, the bill reflects $145 for the part, $50.0 for the service call and $12 for tax - then the total is $286!!  They added in the trip charge.  When I emailed them, they called back to tell me that the charge was because they had to drive to my house!!!  I tried to explain what applied to the charges meant but he kept trying to explain.  Don`t use this company unless you want to be WAY over charged.  The entire job took 10 minutes but the end service charge was $125!!  What a joke!!

She thought she had gotten the tip of a cotton swab lost in her ear canal.  While the time frame in which we were seen was good, I`m writing a bad review due to the cost. My daughter was seen by one doctor, one nurse. No blood was drawn and no scans were given. The doctor examined my daughter and said he could not see the cotton in there, and he thought it must have never been in there. He used one otoscope. No other equipment was used.  We were in the ER for less than an hour total. I paid (after insurance) $612 to the emergency room itself, then was billed $397 for the doctor. That`s over $1000 for a doctor to look in my daughter`s ear for 30 seconds, shrug, and leave.  To add insult to injury the nurse informed me that sometimes stuff can get behind the ear drum and I should watch out in case it ended up infected (not true).  I also asked for an itemized bill since I was wondering what the fresh heck could have possibly cost so much, I was informed they can`t provide itemized bills. I`m pretty sure that`s illegal.  I would never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever recommend this emergency room to anyone.<3<9<2019<23<31<59

First, the lady that goes by the name of Linda is being rude to a woman that JUST got her nails done and accidentally smudged her nail and Linda begins to lecture her on why she should have gotten gel. I`m getting my toes done at this point and was rushed. I told them what and how I wanted it. Linda states she will do my mani and I ask her where the original owners and lies that they are on vacation, only to find out they sold the salon to her and a friend. Then I get my gel mani, Linda did not know was ombré was so Kelly came in and took over and said her self '"no good! Oh my gosh!'" And I reasoned with her and figured she knew it wasn`t right in how my nails looked. Finally I get done about 1.5 hours later on my mani only. I pay and leave. I grab my bag before getting out of my car and the gel rips and under it the gel is STILL WET! I have to go back and when I go back Kelly is fixing the one nail and cuts me while removing the excess nail polish with the buffer. It gets fixed but only after I get cut and punished with nail polish remover being put on my wound after I asked her if I could wash it, she refuses and demands she finishes. I will not recommend going there even if you want a nice design. I attached photos of the finishing look and it is disastrous. The gel is over my cuticles and it`s just sloppy.

The receptionist tried to refuse my legal drivers license because it was punched by the DMV when I renewed a couple days prior but there was a printout to go along with it and the DMV told me it was a legal document.  She said she had to get it ok`d but decided to randomly drug test me (out of spite I believe because I was upset with her). That test was NOT random. I was vocally upset at this. The security guard was right behind me the whole time. I complied with the request, complaining loudly as I had every right to because there was no reason for this. I know Dr. Norris would NOT have ordered this test. They never gave me my prescription and now it`s a the long holiday weekend and I won`t get my meds until next week sometime unless they decide I don`t deserve them.. Was told I`d have to PAY for that test out of pocket since my ins changed. I am changing drs because SMA is not on my new plan but that is NO reason I cannot have the prescriptions already given to me. and btw, I was going to try to change ins to go back to SMA but now I never will.

Get customers who want to pay you money connected to your service. I purchased a house in Middleton and decided to sign up for TDS rather then Charter or AT&T to support a local big business. They gave me a two week wait time and a install range of 8 hours. I thought that was a little ridiculous but I said ok and signed up. Well install day came and went and no one showed up or called. Having to reach out myself and find out what happened. I was told something went wrong. What you ask? They had no idea but they`d need to push the install an entire week. I informed them that was unacceptable, which they had little reaction to and said well we can escalate and call you back. I let them escalate and got off the phone after they promised to let me know by Noon (it was 8:00AM) what the status was of my escalation. In the mean time I called Charter who was able to install the next morning in a 2 hour time window. I scheduled the install and waited to see if I would get a call back from TDS. Well not to my surprise I did not. I called and said I was canceling the install and they seemed fine with it and told me to have a great day.   Honestly if they had offered me a better monthly deal or done something to compensate me for my time and frustration I`d probably have put up with it but they were 100% fine with my not getting TDS installed...<15<5<2014<21<29<1

It`s in a fairly large shopping complex with lots of other stores and restaurants.  It`s large and has a good prepared foods section. I love going in the evenings because they mark down a lot of their prepared foods, and I almost always have luck there with scoring some good eats for cheap.   Their bakery section is also good and they have some stuff that I don`t see at other T&T locations.  I love this Asian grocery store. I`ve been going for years from before they were bought over by Loblaws, and not much has changed from what I can see.   Lots of free parking, but it does get busy and spots may be hard to find.<20<10<2019<2<40<35

RUDL37XWKikZSfVbsifNIQ<FKclATu5-fmK6lsAUuHp7w<5ZqybrqiTdbANn2yI3B3VA<3<0<1<0<A standard Chinese takeout restaurant with a small dining area if you elect to eat in.  There is a limited lunch menu, but the prices are extremely wallet friendly and includes a cup of soup or a soda.    I ordered the BBQ pork in garlic sauce. My egg drop soup is pretty standard, but they got the salt level correct.  I also appreciated the fried wontons skins that the soup, which provided both added flavor and some textural contrast.    The fried rice was too oily and the rice was a bit mushy. My entrée had an interesting medley of vegetables (broccoli, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, red and green peppers, large chunks of celery, baby corn cobs, quartered mushrooms, zucchini, carrots and peas) that were well prepared.  The large portion of pork was too dry and didn`t impart much flavor,  My server was incredibly enthusiastic and checked in to see what I thought of my meal.  She also cleared tables of departed patrons and kept the dining area spotless.  The dining area had a sprinkling of Chinese knick-knacks on the walls, but otherwise, the interior still looked like the Einstein Bagels franchise that previously occupied this space.<13<4<2019<11<56<10

I noticed some damage to the siding on one side of my home over a year ago. When the old siding was removed, we discovered rotting, wet wood and insulation. The siding company checked the downspout in that area and found a big blockage that had caused the eaves to overflow and leak, causing the damage. It had obviously not been cleaned for a long time, since I noticed the damage over a year ago. The last time Sunnyside '"cleaned'" the eaves was in June, 2 months ago, obviously leaving that blockage. I thought they were quick and efficient; now I realize they were quick because they were not thorough. When I called them, I was treated rudely by a supervisor and a partner and bullied into not posting a bad review, in exchange for a cheque to cover the damage. Two weeks later, I have not received their cheque. This company has shown themselves to be untrustworthy and unreliable."<26<9<2019<18<5<48

I told the waitress that I liked very spicy and that I don`t normally eat coconut curries. She recommended the crazy noodles. She said it was very popular. I thought well Mcdonald`s is very popular, what if the clientele that comes here are morons? I said I would like to have the crazy noodles with pork, thai hot! As hot as you can make it. She laughed a little and then retreated to the kitchen. As I was waiting a couple came in. I was assuming a Father and Daughter from the age difference but who knows. He had no idea what to order and she was telling him that she liked spicy. She said two stars was all that she could handle. She said that Mike orders three stars and he sweats like  a really sweaty guy when he eats it. I thought holy crap what have I done. I`ve ordered a heat level off the charts. How am I going to eat this. Is the waitress going to laugh some more and bring out the kitchen staff to laugh at me too. And who the hell is Mike anyway. She brought out my crazy noodles with some water and told me to enjoy. I was apprehensive. It looked hot. It looked damn hot. It had chili seeds everywhere. I took a bite. Ok, maybe it`s one of those sneek up on you heats. I took another. Ok, this is spicy but not debilitating. This was delicious. I enjoyed every bite, thinking Mike is a sissy. The waitress came back and asked if it was spicy enough and I said it`s fine. I can handle hotter. When she handed me the bill I saw that she only placed 3 stars next to my order. It was not thai hot. I still don`t know if I can eat their thai hot.  I wish I knew how to convince the wait staff at Asian restaurants that I really want it hot. They never seem to believe me until after I`m finished eating.<14<12<2012<20<6<5

I had a bumpy start with them after hitting really bad traffic on the way to my initial consultation and I had to reschesule.  When I called in to let them know I felt slightly reprimanded.   When I arrived at my next appointment the person at the front desk was very apologetic about what happened. I really appreciated that.  Fast forward, I`ve been working with Riley to resolve my SI joint-pain.  I was in pretty bad condition.   We started out with general PT and then he suggested we try dry kneedling.  I`d heard about it and decided to try it ----  Ahmmmazing results.  I had my fifth session today and I am almost pain free. It`s pretty incredible.

Everything from the customer service to the food to the design and cleanliness was on par for me. I have to say, so far Ossington has had more solid hits for food for me lately than most other sections of the city.  I love asking what a servers favourite thing is because let`s face it - it beats asking `what do you recommend?`  One usually gets '"oh, everything` or `it depends what you`re into.` Asking someone who`s tried everything for me, has always been a better bet.    Soooo I totally took her recommendation and I loved it!!!   I had the Huevos Mashup. Smokey bacon and fried onions beans, fresh kimchi spiked tomato salsa, guacamole and sour cream, topped with two eggs over easy. Served with corn tortilla chips. Now, as much as this sounds like a lot of food, it still felt light. I could have eaten more. Have to say, it`s one of my favourite breakfast dishes ever.

(rainy days suck)  parking: street park  what I ordered: flight (3 small (actually huge) pancakes of your choice) $9 = makes you super full Flavors: pineapple, blueberry, & sweet potato.  Pineapple was my fav.  Blueberry and sweet potato was okay.  On top of sweet potato pancake, it has pecans which were good.  It comes with syrup and butter.  The pancakes are well-made.  place hours: 6:30-2:30pm  The restaurant is not too small, but it`s crowded.  I to-goed my order but I think they have board games as well.   They also have a bar seating. The place is well decorated with bright lights.  For my to-go order, I waitied around 20min (I understand it was raining and busy).<18<1<2017<20<8<44
Oj6UkZlOtLYWWALdCNTj8A<xyVN7AZAnuWU1ezKWlwheA<utIA0LyQmwP-9DRyxUe6qQ<3<0<0<0<This would have been a 4 star review but I was disappointed with the customer service.   Everyone knows there is always a wait time at Snooze. Therefore, my friend and I decided to be there at 10:30AM on a Saturday to get a table by 11:30AM. To our luck, we got a table around 11:10. They sat us down. We were just sipping on our water and chit chatting while waiting for our 3 other friends to arrive. About 20 minutes later, an employee (probably a manager of some sort) approached us and asked when the rest of our party was coming. We responded that they should be here soon. She said we should check up with our friends because other customers who are waiting won`t be too happy when they see an empty table (we didn`t order any food yet since we were still waiting). FIRST OF ALL, our table was at the very end of the restaurant (next to the bathroom). No one would have noticed us unless they purposely stand at the edge of our table and stare. I wonder if she acts like this with other tables who are just taking their sweet time to finish their food. WE CAME THERE TO EAT so WE WILL ORDER. If your point was to get us to order something first, then just say it. The way you acted made us feel like you wanted to take away our table that we legitimately waited for. Although, I will give her some kudos for trying to lessen the wait time for the other customers since we were still waiting for our friends.  Next issue. Our waiter was not the world`s friendliest person. He checks on us here and there. But when we asked specifically for something like an extra high chair or more coconut milk, you can tell that he was irritated but was trying really hard to not show it. It seems like the only thing he was happy doing was refilling our water.  Besides the annoying customer service experience...their food was delicious.  Smashed Avocado Benny (8/10): Two English muffins topped with smashed avocado, sliced tomatoes, two poached eggs, and smothered with smoked cheddar hollandaise sauce. All the ingredients were perfectly seasoned and I was eager to eat this entree.  I recommend getting their pancake flight so you can try 3 different types of pancakes! Their batter is consistently very fluffy and not too cakey!<11<9<2018<3<35<15

Visited Nonn`s in October following a referral from our SIL since we aren`t local. They have a lovely showroom, no one offered to help us, we had to practically beg for assistance. We waited until a designer was available and when we finally met her, she seemed attentive to our needs. Unfortunately, that`s where the customer service stops. We waited nearly 2 weeks for our first quote for a quartz countertop and had asked one question in response, no response from them,  then had to follow up just to get a response that she missed our original email and would be back shortly. Radio silence ever since its now been over a month. If this is how they treat potential customers, I`d say it`s a good indication of how we would be treated as actual customer. Thanks but no thanks. Since I decided that Nonn`s wasn`t the business for us to worked with, I requested a quote from a competitor, and guess what? The quote was 40% less and more importantly, they communicate, unlike the treatment we received from Nonn`s.<30<11<2019<20<10<35

As far as the king crab legs I ordered, they were the furthest thing from fresh. Quickly into the meal I stopped eating as the bites I had previously endured strongly resembled the taste of tuna.  I notified the waitress as soon as I noticed the remainder of the crab legs were discolored-- not the typical discoloration from the seasoning-- this was practically gray with a rubber-like texture.   My meal wasn`t replaced because according to management and the chef, the below portion eaten to the remaining ratio, was apparently half of the meal.  '"King crab'" ."<1<12<2019<4<25<47

The host sat us at a window seat with a view of the city which was amazing.   Now for the food, I got the mushroom pasta and my boyfriend got the lamb rack. The pasta was cooked to al dente and the sauce was very creamy. It was lacking in flavor a little bit though but the Parmesan wafer on top helped with that.  My boyfriend got the lamb rack which was the highlight of the meal for sure. It was cooked to perfection and every bite was juicy and tender, plus seasoned perfectly. I tried really hard to get him to trade entrees with me but he wouldn`t budge.  Only negative thing to say would be that the server disappeared after taking our order, we only ever saw him again when he dropped off our cheque.  Also, there`s free valet parking (asides from the tip) so that was a nice touch. Overall a good meal with a great view and ambiance.<19<11<2019<4<21<37

I called on Monday morning to book a medical instead of a surgical because I was very early along. I had missed my period and had a feeling I should test so I did and 4 urine tests came back positive. When I called the receptionist was friendly and asked me if I want to come in today, I said no because I would like to discuss with my partner tonight but made an appointment for two days later. I was told to have a light breakfast and that it would take 3-4 hours. I asked for more information but I was told I would be informed the day I come in. My partner and I arrived and were welcomed by the female security guard which I appreciated. Almost all the staff were female. We were brought to the waiting room which is a living room with 15 chairs in a circle so you are in very crowded quarters with everyone. As we were sitting there the security guard asked one of the male partners that was waiting for his partner to finish to leave and come back in 15 or 20 minutes because the waiting room was getting full. Now that I think about it he was the only minority group male in the room and he obliged. I would not have been ok coming back to no-one there. I filled out the paperwork and was quickly brought into the room with a male doctor (surprising since all other staff are female) and told to sit on the table for the ultrasound. I was asked when my last period was and how I knew I was pregnant (which I also told the receptionist when booking the appointment) I advised him that I had taken numerous urine tests. He told me that they are useless and mean nothing. I felt so confused. He then proceeded to ask me why I didn`t go see my doctor, I said I didn`t think I had to before coming here since it wasn`t mentioned and asked why no-one told me when booking that I needed a blood pregnancy test done. He said '"I am telling you now'". He proceeded to do the ultrasound despite telling me that I had to get the blood test done and come back. I told him that I had been having cramps for a few days but period never comes. He stops the ultrasound and says '"cramps like you are going to get your period?'" insinuating that I was jumping the gun and should have known better. I said '"no worse than period cramps'" because I heard of ectopic pregnancies and wanted to make sure he was aware of the cramps in case there was some signs. As soon as he hears the cramps he stops the ultrasound and proceeds to tell me to get dressed and go upstairs for the bloodwork and call the next day and then make arrangements to come back. I called back and the bloodwork was positive just like I knew it would be cause urine tests are done at most doctors offices.   Everyone but the doctor was professional. I will not be going back for visit #2 and have already booked somewhere else. The only thing that this clinic can do to fix this issue is to replace the male doctor with a more compassionate female physician. When I read that he called other woman mama during their visits I couldn`t believe it. HOW INSENSITIVE!"<28<2<2019<20<5<24

lk8OyeA5zd7aYlfsB3gsHg<kQRsnWAQy6_fJUOgpYozaw<jkphPiece7Sg9Y05dHMxEg<1<27<1<1<BEWARE!! This apartment is prone to burglaries and the management does not care about the wellbeing of their residents.  We moved into our unit mid-March and our place was robbed about a month later. Our unit was was next to the leasing office and gates where people often come in and out. Our neighbor`s unit also got broken into by the same people. The robbers were able to figure out that no one was home despite the fact that all of my roommates cars were parked outside. We had only left for dinner for an hour and a half, and our neighbors unit was broken into while they were at the pool! Even LVMPD were suspicious about the residents because the officer told us that this area has been prone to burglaries lately.  We told management that we felt violated, unsafe, and how we believe it`s someone living in the complex, but they sort of just laughed and brushed it off. They told us that even if it was a resident, that they wouldn`t come back to rob the same place twice. Was that supposed to make me feel better? While I understand that management has no control of burglaries, they should at least increase security measures or help us get security footage from the front gates at the time of occurrence. Although, we did make assumptions, I feel that it`s never wrong to question these situations because you never know, but the least management could`ve done was listen to our concerns or be a shoulder to lean on through the tough times, but they did not care.  Since we were only a month into our lease, we requested to break it and move out. They expected us to cough up $5,500 (4 months of rent) to break our lease, plus pay for 4 months of water, sewage, and trash even when we`re not going to live there. That policy is ridiculous for our situation, and although we were able to bring it down to 2 months, residents should still not to have to pay such as astronomical amount to leave a place, especially when they feel unsafe and violated. They also stated that there are security guards that patrol the premises, but I come home between the hours of 12:30am and 1:00am, and the guards just hang out near the front of the office instead of patrolling.  I`m usually the one not to write reviews especially long and critical ones. I understand that people are overly dramatic sometimes in their reviews when it comes to bad experiences, and sometimes it doesn`t reflect the true actions of management, but this was a bad experience worth mentioning. The management was not sympathetic at all, they were annoyed and rude when we came in to sign our vacating papers. Some of the workers in the office just straight up ignored us and if that doesn`t speak on their professionalism, then I don`t know what else will.  Again, we understand that sometimes it`s difficult to maintain everything, but at least try to act like you care about the residents. Trust what the other reviews say because I wish I listened to them instead of wasting my time and money into this place.  BTW, The Wyatt replies to all these reviews saying that they will be more than happy to handle concerns, or to speak to them in the office, but don`t even bother because they were rude to us.<27<8<2017<23<44<11

There was another couple outside and eventually throughout the night it got busier.  We ordered summer rolls that came with Tofu.  We were really hungry and they were a great appetizer.  I ordered the pad Se Ew with chicken.  The only problem was that it took a while for our food to come out.  The waitress told us a few times that it would be soon but it probably took 30 minutes.  They do a lot of take out here so maybe that`s why they were behind because it usually doesn`t take this long.  It did come out and it was really good.  I can`t complain.  I ate everything.  The noodles were perfect and the chicken was good too.  I got a 6 spice level and probably could have did a 7 or 8.  This is a really good Thai place but too bad it took too long.

97Lsx-cabxMFaGkdgFJ8fg<QtHm6aCw_M51yKJsiU5Hdg<cG6X1idjECJFYUJCAxKgUg<4<5<2<2<After visiting nab nail over a handful of times, I thought it was time to give a thorough review about my experiences with their nail techs. I was searching for THE nail tech when I came across nab nail on Instagram. I loved their late hours so I thought I`d give them a shot. I normally get  acrylic, or acrylic overlay, or gel sets with designs. Here are my experiences:  Nana - zero punctuality but talented af. The best thing about Nana was that she was meticulous and fast. My nails always looked great and I`d be done in 45 mins. Her customer service was ehhh and she didn`t talk much but honestly, it didn`t bother me bec my nails were on point. And her sets lasted 3-4 weeks with no lifting. I don`t think she works at nab nail anymore which is a total loss for nab.  Lucy - she makes sure I like what she`s doing as she`s doing it. She checks to see I approve of the shape, color, design and I love that! Sometimes the initial color or design you choose may not look that great on you so it helps to double check. Otherwise you walk out unhappy and you know who you end up blaming? Your tech! Lucy`s customer service is on point. Really friendly. Her sets last a good 3-4 weeks as well. Buuuuut she has filed the crap out of my cuticles before. I have really dry cuticles so they bleed easily. When a tech does NOT leave me bleeding, then I`m super impressed.  Nini - talented af. She`s not as fast as Nana or Lucy but it`s bec she is super meticulous. I came to her with an ig pic to replicate and Nini`s work ended up looking better. The reason I haven`t gone back to her is bec I had gotten a new full set with her and it started to lift pretty badly after 2.5-3 weeks and I had a couple nails break off. I`m so used to sets lasting me 3-4 weeks. I may go back to her bec I know she`s good. Customer service-wise, she`s friendly too.  K Mechelle - great conversationalist buuuuut my nails were horrible. Gel too thick, nails too square, and I didn`t realize the gel wasn`t completely cured until I got home. They were ugly to look at but fun to play with. Imagine silly putty sitting on your nails (putty is an exaggeration obviously, but you get it). I scheduled another appt with her 2 days later to fix. Tbh, I didn`t want to schedule with her again but I thought it`d be good to let her redeem herself. I do try to sit with someone once or twice before I judge, but when I got there, she had left for the day despite the fact I had an appt. Ofc I won`t be going to her anymore.  Crystal - she did major damage control after the mess K Mechelle left me with. She took off the gel, reshaped my nails, and just left me feeling really good about my nails. She did a great job and I will probably go see her again for my next fill.   Customer service is a hit or miss when you walk in and when you leave. The front desk girl acts like she dgaf about you so you kinda feel the same way about her. At the end of the day, she`s not the one doing your nails so whatever. There is a woman who walks around asking if you would like something to drink, so that`s nice. Prices are on the higher end bec they do charge for everything. For example, it`s $5 to shape. I do spend a lot of money here and I`m still trying to decide if it`s worth it or not. I guess you can say I`m still searching for THE one.<24<12<2018<10<39<5

What happens is the internal strings break, which requires replacing the entire motor/mechanism. So in addition to not raising properly from day one, the internal strings eventually break whereby the shades no longer raise at all. I found a place online where I can order the internal motors/mechanisms (at a cost of $70 a pop!) and I have become an expert at taking these shades apart and repairing them myself. However, I`m at the point now where the next time they break I`m planning to replace these shades with something entirely different rather than keep spending $70 per shade, per year (which is about how frequently they break, on average). Bottom line, don`t buy this type of shade because they are horrible, and don`t shop at Superior Blinds because they don`t stand behind the products they sell!<20<11<2019<22<43<39

They canceled my appointment he day before without notifying me beforehand and asked if I could come in at a totally different time. I had scheduled my appointment weeks in advance around my work schedule and I ended up asking my boss to let me off so I could fit THEIR schedule. The morning of my 9am appointment I showed the lash woman a picture of what I wanted (see 1st pic) and she said that would be considered their volume set at $120. I was okay with the price and she said it would take an hour. 20 minutes in, a woman walked in and said she had a 9am appt. The lash woman realized she double booked us and left me on the table for about 5 minutes. She came back in and after another 20 minutes she informed me she was finished. It had been 45 minutes and I had far less lashed than she promised me. I told her that I was unhappy about it and she said there was nothing she could do as she was fully booked. She charged me the regular price for a volume set although she rushed (see 2nd and 3rd pic) and I walked out with a '"classic set'". I went to two other lash locations and they all told me that she clearly rushed as my lashed were all over the place and I was overcharged. I later messaged Lash Vegas and she does not intend to give me a refund and will not message me back or answer my phone calls. Very disappointed and absolutely do not recommend."<3<1<2019<21<31<39

Cr6Ik4I0LohLL9haAFDi1A<NIJWrUAz7-9IEqwZnGBT9g<EgW-kEqxP83MlVl06Qn21g<1<6<0<0<My parents have been here on a couple different occasions and have always talked about how good the food is, however last week I met with them for dinner on a Thursday evening and I can`t say I will ever want to come back.  It was completely packed, but my mom was able to get a table in the middle of the dining room and my dad and I arrived shortly after.  A waitress came to take our drink orders and we asked if it was OK if we waited for my dad to arrive. Our drinks arrived and shortly after, so did my dad.    It wasn`t for another 15 minutes that we saw our waitress again to order my dads drink and all of our food.  I ordered the salmon & broccoli with Caesar salad, my mom got the reuben and my dad had BBQ wings and a cup of chili.  The food took about 20 minutes to come out, which was understandable, because it was so busy.  When it was brought out to our table, everything looked good, however it did not taste the way it looked.  My broccoli was cold and had no seasoning or salt on it.  The salmon was insanely dry and flavorless - hardly edible even doused in one of the three sauces it came with and the Caesar salad was good, but the dressing had WAY too much lemon in it - very sour. My mom said her reuben was just OK. the bread was not buttered and there was hardly dressing on it.  Dad`s wings, which I tried, were basic  - tough and didn`t seem that great of quality. He said his chili was overly packed with beans.  We did not see our waitress again until she brought out or checks.  Poor service and terrible food during our visit - I even commented to my mom after we left that it was probably the worst meal and experience I have ever had at a restaurant.  I can`t believe this place was so packed...but maybe it`s a different story when youre just coming for the bar.  The interior is nothing special - certainly not fancy.  The tables are strange wooden tables that you`d find at your grandmothers house and the bar area is enormous.  Very casual.  Our table was sticky and the floors weren`t very clean - just very bizarre.<1<5<2017<17<26<37

On one hand I had fantastic teachers, a great learning environment, administration was lovely and it was all round a good experience. I thoroughly liked being there.   However, this course made me a believer that not all industry jobs should be offered at technical schools. Especially ones where the entry level salary expectation is minimum wage. If you have any financial obligations (car payments, rent, another mouth to feed) and you don`t plan on paying tuition up front, paying back your loan is nearly impossible. Or it will take forever. I loved being there and I feel good about the education I received. But the experience was tainted by knowing those industry instructors that I liked so much were very familiar with the salary their students will be earning at the end, and still chose to be part of what I consider, a money grab course.   It was especially frustrating that I was reprimanded for having quite a few absences due to the need to work (to pay for the course), yet I had the marks to pass easily. I understand the importance of attendance, but attendance doesn`t trump needing to provide for myself. I didn`t feel like administration was very understanding in that aspect. At all. They were very much '"policy'" and very little '"let`s talk about it'".  This course is suitable if you are fresh out of high school, still living with your parents and want to gain knowledge and confidence before stepping into the industry. For anyone else, I wouldn`t recommend it."<5<7<2018<17<13<20

Now this was the 1st time I have ever been to a Brazilian steakhouse, so I didn`t know what was in store, but that everyone said to go hungry.   You 1st start off with a salad bar, but this is an upscale salad bar, and to be honest I didn`t even get a green salad. They have a charcuterie, meats, cheese, breads. They also have fresh seafood and crab salad, chicken salad, the freshest caprese salad. So much to choose from that you really need to limit yourself because this salad bar is not the star of the dinner. Save some room for the meat!  Galeto has a lot of cuts of meat to offer. I tried picanha, alcatra, prime rib, filet mignon, filet mignon con bacon,  frango com bacon and much more. I have to say each cut of the meat was so tender and full of flavor and so savory. The pinanha was my favorite cut of the night then the filet mignon. Galeto has a great system to let the servers know when you are ready to eat, a little dot of paper with red on one side and green on the other.

But what happened while my car was being serviced is absolutely unacceptable. I came in for a Transmission Fluid change and I guess you have to stay in your car since it`s a drive through service, that`s totally fine. The guy who helped me even honored a price I was quoted at my oil change, even though it was an incorrect quote, that was awesome, seriously appreciated because budgeting for this stuff is a pain. However. There is a gentleman that was greeting and assigning the guests to lanes for whatever service they were getting. That same gentleman waited until the guy servicing my car walked away or went downstairs to come up to my car and harass me. Keep in mind, I`m literally stuck in my car because there is no longer fluid and they`re working on it. I was clearly uncomfortable and unsure why he kept coming up to my car. He proceeded to ask me if I have a boyfriend and made remarks about my looks. As soon as the servicing attendant came back, that dude bolted, and pretended to be busy somewhere else. Again, the servicing attendant walks away to grab equipment or whatever for my car, and the creepy dude comes crawling back up to my window asking me if I have a twin sister, and saying how lucky my boyfriend is to have me. Honestly, I`ve never been more uncomfortable in my life. I mean it`s one thing to be able to walk away from someone when they`re creeping you out, but to actually be physically stuck somewhere and not have a way of escaping is a whole other ball game.

Parking in the lot is almost impossible, so expect to park in the nearby neighborhoods.  We got the spuds deluxe with sausage and mushrooms, the benny duo with the ham benedict and the chile verde, and the blueberry danish pancakes. The spuds deluxe came as a HUGE plate of hash browns, which were good but not spectacular. Both the benedicts however were delicious! The smoked cheddar hollandaise, poached egg, and english muffin were such a great combination on the ham benedict. The pancakes are also huge, but seemed a bit dry.

My wife had the Mayan Mocha, an adult coffee beverage (iced), which was delicious! She had the Sandwich I Am sandwich, which was great--she added avocado and had it with black beans on the side (refried).  Parking is somewhat limited--you might have to walk a bit--but there is a parking lot there. Definitely go--I`m sure you can find whatever you want on their extensive menu!<20<7<2016<20<40<14

A bowel of oatmeal, or eggs, or pancakes at home is fine for me and the family.  However, I must say Snooze is really good.  Everything was fresh and had great flavors.  Had the pancake flight and pot pie.  Our waitress was a bit distracted and just seemed unengaged with us - another waiter actually came by to ask if we needed anything.  Glad he asked - yes, more coffee please.   Parking is bad but just deal.  We didn`t wait on a weekday and was there about 8:30-9.

qEgvI-UbaLNOwQ_zeMsisw<aDvQD-SbEp7OOUyzST_mBQ<Xcw3KkEWGWrRm2A-HLGXrQ<1<0<0<0<"Story time friends!!   I go into Walgreens, in person, on Friday to fill a prescription. They say they don`t have it in stock, so they will order it, said they DID order it, and to call back on Monday because it should be in by then. I`m like- yeah, no problem, I can wait.   I call back Monday, use the automated phone service, and it says my order still hasn`t been filled. So today is Tuesday, and I call back to check on the order. The automated service is like, '"we have no records for anything under your phone number.'" So I press to speak to a real person. What does the real person say? '"Oh, we didn`t order it because it`s not covered by your insurance and we didn`t want to order it without you agreeing.'" I say, '"Okay so why didn`t the woman ask me that IN PERSON when I was there FRIDAY, or why didn`t I at least receive a call asking if I would be okay with ordering it? You guys just waited for me to call, after already waiting four days thinking the prescription will be there?'" The woman says... '"Yeah we can order it if you`re willing to pay out of pocket.'" Yeah I was willing to pay out of pocket but you guys are literally so inept that you ordering today means nothing, it`ll probably be another week before I get it!!! I`m ordering somewhere else like I should have in the first place. You people don`t know how to do your job and you do NOT CARE.   My poor baby has a cough and a fever, she`s gone since Friday morning without a nebulizer and cough meds. She is ten months old, she doesn`t understand that Walgreens people are stupid and therefore she has to stay uncomfortable and miserable longer. You guys are freaking TERRIBLE, I am DONE with Walgreens. Get it together. You`re impacting babies`, childrens` and peoples` lives with your stupidity. I`m so angry I could spit. You`re getting paid to do your job - do it.   Any Walgreens corporation workers reading this, y`all should spend less on your commercials targeting cancer patients and more money either training your employees and/or paying them more. If they felt valued as workers, they would care about their jobs and therefore, actually do them. It doesn`t take a sales analyst to know how the system works."<3<12<2019<16<48<16
diqgVxh-AQShfMSHBSehuA<cgdaRaQuZIxE1wKZXrmDEg<C8crFJ1PMYXfeilVRJT-9g<5<8<2<1<I have worked with Republic West for home remodeling since 2006. Initially we wanted to update our kitchen and RW suggested re-facing our cabinets in order to modernize the kitchen without breaking the bank. Well 10 years later the kitchen is still one of my favorite redesigned rooms in our home. The expertise and workmanship has lasted well beyond our expectations.   Fast forward 5 years to 2011 we decided to call RW again when we wanted to do a complete remodel of our master bathroom. The project was handled with exemplary care and with the finest and most precise detail. This project required complete removal of old plumbing and installation of new shower and steam room. A major project that went smoothly and on time. The crew from the various contractors (i.e. designers, plumbers, tillers, etc.) were all experts and completed the scheduled work on time.   So now it is 2016 and we needed the outside house painted. While researching contractors for this project we came across RW again. We met with Dwight who was knowledgeable and informative of a product being used to protect the outside of the house with the option of lifetime warranty. Without hesitation we hired their services. We opted to use this  product called Tank Paint, with lifetime warranty against cracks. But most impressive were the painters Sergio and his crew who work with RW. What a professional and well organized crew. Sergio fielded my questions with kindness and if I had any concerns he reassured me that the project was exactly as we had discussed and the schedule was on time. With explicit attention to detail, the job was done a day early!   I can not say enough about the level of care, coordination, and professionalism Republic West provides. We will continue to use their services as the need arises and I look forward to working with them again in the future.<29<2<2016<16<12<22

But change of name aside, nothing about this loud, boisterous, theme park of an Izakaya seemed to change. On my first visit I sat in the sunken table area near the front of house, on the recent one at the high shared style tables near the back. Never mind though, the volume level at both was insane, with a combination of loud rap music, shouting staff and tables of young instagrammers shouting over the din.   Full disclosure: I may be older than the average yelper and on both visits I was with even older family members, but the volume levels were not just unpleasant but made talking impossible among us. One member of our party actually turned down the music, as the place was not that busy, but that was later undone by staff.  The shouting of staff might seem like some kind of '"authentic'" Japanese experience to the Toronto diner, but while it is based on the cheerful greetings of Japanese eateries, it`s taken to a bizarre level by this chain,  obviously trying to make the experience '"larger than life'" and perhaps for some diners that`s what they want.  On to the food, and service. We had a well meaning but ineffective server on our last visit. Communication was hard with accent and noise, but we managed to order about 10 or 12 sharing items between six of us. The food came out in helter skelter manner. With beer and miso soup coming mid-meal, edamame never coming at all, and two noodle dishes coming so late that we nearly cancelled them. In fairness it was probably the kitchen more than the server, but in most restaurants servers take ownership of poor kitchen speed, apologizing or explaining to diners. Ours did nothing and seemed helpless in the situation.  Now for the good news. The food itself is quite good. The menu is big, with seasonal specials and mostly both authentically Japanese and creative. Some highlights were agedashi tofu, spare ribs, miso yellowtail and takoyaki. If the place wasn`t such a ridiculous volume bomb, with poor service order I would be tempted to try it again. As it is, there are enough good izakayas in the city with better service and less obnoxious atmospheres. Kampai!"<29<10<2019<2<42<32
LqltCVIqnNPHERNrgWIBYw<s1lSqHleEH3OLjUwy6tcYg<mJ_ucQ2_3hfTsmCcKb-hgw<4<1<0<0<I like to think of Sienna on the Square as one of my first true Pittsburgh meals. I ventured over to Market Square the evening after moving to Pittsburgh, desperate to find a quality restaurant for a good meal with my parents. We stumbled upon Sienna and decided to give it a try. It was around 6pm on a weekday but already full, so we put our name in with the hostess and walked around outside for awhile. We then sat at the bar and had a drink. After 30 minutes of waiting (and a few tables opening up), the bartender went out of her way to check with the hostess to get us seated. We were very impressed with this service and were seated outside on a lovely evening.   The meal itself was delicious. Our waitress was knowledgable and able to provide suggestions to us. We started with the mozzarella stuffed meatballs and YUM! I could make a meal out of those meatballs and a glass of wine. For entrees, we tried the mafalde bolognese, linguine and clams, and one of the pasta specials for the day. Everything tasted great  and was quite filling - the portions can definitely feed you for more than one meal!   I`m glad I visited Sienna on one of my first nights living in this city. It made a lasting impression on me and I look forward to returning on another special occasion.<15<9<2019<21<2<19

Unfortunately we didn`t know this place had BYOW and doesn`t serve any alcohol so we missed out. The restaurant is nicely decorated and feels cozy but the space is very tight. Service was rude. We were a party of 5 and as this was our first time trying North African cuisine. We asked our waiter for popular options and she just pointed to the entire section of the menu. Ummmm I can read myself. We got an assortment of appetizers but nothing stood out. For my main I ended up getting the grilled kebab couscous. It was a huge portion but tasted like steamed vegetables. When the bill came, it was in French so we took a while to read through it but our waitress barged in claiming she didn`t overcharge us. Not a fun experience and I most definitely won`t revisit or recommend.   Service: 1/5 Presentation: 4/5 Taste: 2/5 Price: 2/5  Ambiance: 3/5 Overall: 2/5<5<12<2019<23<54<42

We were seated at 8:30, a half hour before closing and our server could not have been anymore unenthusiastic. I don`t know if they were new or if it was related to the timing of our reservation. Throughout our meal, other staff were overly zealous on checking our meal progress.  I understand, as a servers and kitchen staff, being disappointed about a late reservation but our meal for 4 was over $200 and we really found the experience to be lacking - particularly when bringing guests from overseas to a '"nice'" restaurant. We have had friends had a similar experience when arriving close to closing time.  This is certainly not what I expected from a quality establishment and we will likely make a point of not dining here any more.  I`d really encourage management to either ensure the quality of service is maintained for all guests they seat - regardless of when that is, or limit the time of last seating to ensure people are getting treated properly."<24<7<2019<4<37<44

We waited another 20 minutes before we could order.  The food was perfect,  25 pounds if lobster stacked in a tower form filled with fries and lettuce it was a sight to see. The meat was great, although not very flavorful the large chunks of lobster made it worth every bite.  The 2 entrees came first, sweet and sour pork fresh hot and crispy, the beefs with vegetables was cooked beautifully medium rare. They made sure to serve it first because god knows we dived into that lobster as quick as can be.  Soup was okay and nothing fancy.  It come with a tray of macaroons!!! How awesome!! Although it didnt taste phenomenal just the worth it price of these makes it so much better.  The service was great, they come very often to change plates, let us stay longer just to chat after they closed and take our pictures, and went out of their way to explain everything!!  I really fell inlove with this place and I can really see how many fans they really have.  You dont need a lot of people to eat there, I see tables of pairs of 2 to families of 10 and more.

It wasn`t too busy since they opened at 5:30pm  JG is located on the second floor of Aria. Once you take the escalators upstairs it`s tucked in the back by the other two Aria restaurants.   The decor/lighting is pretty nice and the tables are spaced out so you`re not too close to other customers.  FOOD: the complementary house rolls were amazing! The herb/salted butter is so delicious!   Note: Everything is a la carte.   I ordered the 18oz Prime bone-in Rib eye (medium rare) and it came out perfect.   It came plated with a chimichurri type sauce and four other sauces - I can`t remember them all but one was a bearnaise and one was a bbq (which was my favorite and kind of tasted like a hoisin sauce).

QKVSlOOCFak9uYBzJ3fw5w<bKYVaVP1tIihghIAohH5xg<EpPOZAG0u7qHP-jv5HjFUg<1<0<1<0<Sadly our favorite regular weekly favorite is changing - gone from generous, service oriented, to ridiculous games and lack of customer service.  We typically come in weekly or every other week and get 6 bowls for our family.  All 4 kids choose this as their favorite take out restaurant.  A couple of them only get the fish and rice with a sauce and the other two of them ask for a huge scoop of seaweed salad with their fish and rice, and nothing more.  My husband and I get a couple of the toppings and also ask for a large scoop of seaweed salad and cucumber salad.  From the day this place opened, the owner himself even bragged about how he was focused on making the best poke bowls and pleasing the customer, not nickel and diming over the toppings but including it in the price - so every employee all these times made sure to ask if we wanted more of any topping.  They always gave the kids the extra scoop of seaweed and us any extra ginger, cucumber, etc.. Tonight, it all changed.  After I had two of the bowls ready with just fish and rice, I asked for a little extra seaweed on the next bowl - and the lady along with the manager said that I would have to pay a dollar if I wanted extra.  I was shocked and acted confused - now suddenly I have to pay extra for another little bit of seaweed and cucumber for each of the bowls? Meanwhile a couple of the bowls only have 1-2 toppings and one bowl doesn`t have any!  If you added up the times that one of my kids only got fish and rice, with no discount for not having toppings, it would equal a year of extra seaweed on several bowls!  After a long discussion, I convinced the manager to at least put a little extra seaweed and cucumber into one of the bowls because of the bowl that only had fish and rice.  But really? Now we have to play games, nickel and dime the customers? I usually leave a 3-10$ tip each time I go - I am so angry as all that money over the years, had I saved it, could now have covered the stupid extra dollar or two for each bowl instead of a tip! I was tipping for the awesome customer service - but no more.  We will start exploring other takeout options from now on!<22<11<2019<5<24<56

However I won`t be returning as I`ve realized the importance of having a fully equipped and staffed pet hospital available when a pet is sick. Although they call themselves a hospital, it is not staffed 24/7, labs have to be sent out, techs and others called in to conduct certain tests, etc. Detroit Dover is fine for normal wellness checkups. But for a pet who is sick and when time is important, go to a vet staffed in an actual hospital. I`ll be establishing care elsewhere mainly for this reason. Side note. Saw Dr Malak twice as pets were sick and needed first available appointment. Could really try to improve his bedside manner and empathy skills. Would not recommend him.<6<8<2019<22<43<1

The other side of the counter displayed their roasted chicken and various sandwiches. I ordered the Calamari and Arancini on my visit. The Calamari had a light batter and the crunch factor but the squid meat was too thin and hard. The Arancini came with three in an order and it was good. I liked that they made the items at the time of order so nothing came out soggy but overall nothing was mindblowing. I was given a buzzer after paying which allowed me to wander around Eataly. I waited about 10 minutes before the buzzer went off for order pickup. The total of both items with tax cost $32.48 which is very expensive for what I ordered.   After paying, I noticed on the receipt that I was charged a dollar more than what was stated on the menu for my Calamari. I brought this to the cashiers`s attention and his response was that they increased the price a week ago. The difference was a dollar but I expected more from Eataly. Based on what the cashier said, it meant that prices on menus located on both sides of the counter were outdated. It should be simple. If you don`t change the menu, don`t charge the new price!<12<12<2019<7<21<25

The price they quoted me was good for the ink cartridges I required. I advised the rep that I had just purchased new cartridges. So, if they sent me replacements, it might be awhile before I tried them. And, I would not pay for them until I tried them. She said okay. She would ship them and call me within 30 days to see if I had an opportunity to use them. They called me towards the end of December and I told them I was still using the ones I had purchased the previous month. I offered to send the back, but she said no, keep them another month. Then, I received a call at the end of January and I advised her I was nearing the end of the black cartridge. I asked her if she wanted me to return them because I understood it had been a couple of months, but I was always upfront with her about my usage and when I would anticipate using their cartridge(s). So, I asked her to send me an invoice and, after I tried the black cartridge, I would remit payment on good faith for the others. I installed it on 02/10/2017(I always write the date on the box in order to see how long I get out of the cartridges).      Today, I received a collections letter for the outstanding balance. I immediately called them and asked for a return address  for the unused cartridges. Now, all of a sudden, no one is available to talk to me. I was advised by the operator someone would call me back. I will pay for the black cartridge and else. I will never use them again, nor will I refer anyone to them.  F.Y.I.       Immediately after posting this review, I received a call from Ken to discuss the account. I explained to him what had happened. He gave me their side and I paid him for the ink cartridges.

Tech told me he didn`t have the right Whirlpool part, but a GE part would work the same. Despite the fact that I had diagnosed the problem and told him it was the igniter, (I`d had the gas company tech here,) I was charged for the service call ($99,) plus the labor ($148,) and the part ($105.) The bill was $352 total. The Sears tech was here approx. 30 minutes. When I made the appt. I made sure to confirm with the CS rep that I wasn`t going to be charged for BOTH the service call and the labor if I decided to get the work done. I was assured I would not be charged for both. The tech wouldn`t honor that...so, I disputed it with my credit card company. (I`ve done this for the same reason with Sears Home Services previously, for a washing machine repair, and gotten the appropriate refund.) These techs KNOW they are not supposed to charge for both labor and the service call but they do anyway, I guess figuring many customers won`t dispute it...or are too stupid to know better. Well, I know better and I did dispute it. Plus, since it was the wrong part, I knew I was in a better bargaining position. Here I am, 11 months later and the igniter isn`t working AGAIN. (And keep in mind, from May until last month, I had not even used my oven!) I knew the igniter was going to go out because I could hear the valve squeaking when it would open and close. Thankfully, I got a FULL REFUND, although it took a few months...and now I need to have the repair RE-DONE...this time by another repair company. Buh-bye Sears Home Services.<3<11<2019<3<24<14

I`m not sure how much of my experience was due to the event planners and how much was due to the winery, so I`m throwing it all in together with this review until I can come back another time on my own.  We were in the side building for our private party and valet was offered if needed. Coat check was also offered. Nice atmosphere inside with lovely fall decor (but most of this was because the event planners brought in the decor like centerpieces and fabric/flowers for the chairs and fireplace). This would make a great space for an intimate wedding reception. Hors d`oeuvres were brought around: shrimp, bacon wrapped dates, cheese puffs, and two types of wine as well. Food was nice, however you had to chase down the staff to get a bite. I`m sure they were doing their best with this large party. It appeared food was stationed in a tent outside that they had to keep going back and forth to. But walk around the room, don`t say in one spot.   For the meal we started with a salad, bread, and wine. Salad was nice, but there was supposed to be butter for the bread and it was not found. Main dish was bland white fish with under-cooked Brussels sprouts and fingerling potatoes with short rib. The latter part of the meal was good otherwise it was a little disappointing. Two wines served with this. Next up was dessert - a chocolate, cream, and berry cake which was lovely although probably too big as no one seemed to be able to finish theirs. No boxes were offered so unfinished cake went to waste. Wine included with dessert and then coffee to finish the night off if you wanted. We got a little box of chocolates to take home as well.   We toured the rest of the grounds and it was very busy, but seemed like a nice place to visit. Apparently in the main rooms you have to order your wine at the bar and then order your food at the bakery counter. No table service.   Overall we enjoyed our evening at the fundraiser. I am curious to check out this place and see what it is like when I`m just a regular customer.<18<11<2019<17<46<14

I trust Total Real Estate because they take care of my tenants and the properties as if it was their own! Total Real Estate has now managed my properties for over 2 years and I have never had to worry about my investment.   I just purchased another investment property and within a few weeks, it has already been rented out! Thanks so much guys I know my properties are in good hands!<25<11<2019<22<6<59

A neighbor told us about this place, and best of all it`s only a few blocks from our house. Uphill the entire way unfortunately. But it was worth the trek! This is some of the best Thai food I`ve had outside of Thailand. I had a green chicken curry and wife had beef and vegetable dish. The food was all aromatic and flavorful, perfectly cooked and well-presented. The coconut rice is phenom! The restaurant itself has a lovely atmosphere, with a Buddha shrine just like you`d find in most places of business in Thailand. I knocked off a star because the service was really slow, even after the restaurant cleared out. Seemed like only two girls were working the entire restaurant; one of the waitresses complained that everyone had called in sick that day and it was super busy even for a Sunday night. Also I thought the price is high but then, everything is in Calgary.<8<1<2016<1<55<30

I went to a few but I wasn`t happy with how they treated my shirts (really people, stop stapling tags to my shirts or going overboard on the plastic. Bad for enviro).  Anyway all the great reviews took me here to Wild Rose. The young man and woman who run this shop are very pleasant. Not only is it a dry cleaner but they also are a top notch tailor where you can get a custom-made suit!  I`ll have to try that in the future. And they are open 7 days a week!  My only complaint is it`s far from my house and the parking situation is hit & miss.<9<10<2015<1<34<28

What a bad choice to make in the first place.. it was hot and humid sitting outside today. I was sweating like crazy.  Having said that, I was already kind of irritated.   I didn`t take a good look at the inside, but I did go to the bathroom which was clean and well organized. There is only 1 sink to wash hands. The AC inside felt so good compared to sitting outside.   We ordered our drinks and it took around 10 minutes for us to receive it. Took another 10 minutes to place our order bc our waitress was no where to be found, and took around 25 minutes to get our food. The overall wait time was extremely long. Not sure if our waitress was busy with other things, but her service was slow (but she was nice and apologized for the wait).   I ordered the snooze classic, with scrambled eggs, bacon AND sausage (had to give some to my doggo), and hash browns. I`ve also upgraded my toast to the pancake of the day which was aloha pancakes.  I loved the hash browns, but the bacon, sausage, and eggs weren`t so great. Bacon wasn`t crisp enough, sausage was kind of bland, and the scrambled eggs were over cooked. The aloha pancakes were amazing none the less!   For the price that I was paying, $32 including tip, was just way too overpriced for the food. The mimosa was $8, and to upgrade to a pancake was an extra $4.   I`d still come back for the great pancakes, but I`d pass on the savory selections.<20<7<2017<21<46<36
s5R9GlfCPSDFuN8044xljQ<KEG4HIbEOBcp-gNTEXvxsA<utIA0LyQmwP-9DRyxUe6qQ<4<4<0<0<This establishment has some work to do with the wait time for food to come out but every negative aspect was wiped clear when we dug our teeth into the magnificent piece of breakfast/lunch that came out a little late.   We got: -The corned beef hash. Tasted great but it got too boring of a taste mid way where I had to use a good portion of the Sriracha sauce for the taste to kick back in again.  -The Snooze Classic. The bf got it cause he liked to keep his food simple. It tasted good. Not much to compliment on it. Just the average joe for a classic breakfast meal. -OMG! French Toast. The highlight of my day. I`m a sweet tooth and this plate was just the sweet tooth meal to finish off my great breakfast.   Like I said, you`ll be waiting a while for the food to come out so I wouldn`t recommend this place who needs to be out in a jiffy or who`s looking for a quick breakfast. But when you`re seated and all the while you`re waiting, the waitress comes every now and then to apologize for the wait and that she just checked and it`ll be out shortly. I don`t know if she really went and checked and all but it`s the thought that counts :)<20<8<2016<6<30<22
nlLVGDduTNsfqauZZgd7Yw<N46KsQs4xlR-RGxgLBm80A<utIA0LyQmwP-9DRyxUe6qQ<4<0<0<0<Snooze A.M. is the place for you if you`re a fan of brunch and waiting for a long time! This business is smart enough to know that distractions keep people pleased and build up an appetite. Lucky for you, breakfast/brunch eater, this restaurant provides several outdoor game options you can occupy yourself with while waiting for seating. Before you get too excited about losing in a game of Connect Four, make sure to go inside and give them your name and phone number. They`ll contact you when a table is ready. Prepare to do some more waiting after you are seated and have your order taken. You won`t have games to distract you at this point, but at least you`re seated! My advice is to get there really early (no later than 7:30 AM). The wait time to get seated was about 30 - 40 minutes when I went around 8:30 AM on a Saturday morning. I had better luck on my second visit when I got there at 7 AM on a freezing cold Saturday morning. Parking was easy, and I was immediately seated that second time.   I got the Bella! Bella! Bunny the first time I tried Snooze A.M., and I would no doubt try that again someday. It was savory and filling--no complaints there. What made my first trip so memorable and worthwhile was the server, Katrina. She was incredibly kind and informative! When I asked her about the pancake of the day, she said what it was and described it. I passed up on it, but at the end of the meal, she gave my table that pancake as a complimentary dessert.   The memorable service lured me back for a second visit. The service wasn`t as impressive as Katrina`s, but it was fine. I had the Breakfast Pot Pie with a sunny side up egg this time and didn`t enjoy it as much as I thought I would. The flavors were bland, but the crust was perfectly flaky. It was definitely filling, and I had to bring home the leftovers. I also ordered the pancake of the day for dessert, which I believe was a blueberry Danish pancake. It was delicious!   Overall, the food was good, but it doesn`t stand out from other breakfast/brunch joints. I don`t think the wait is worth it, but I am a fan because of the astonishing service I got during my first visit. Katrina is actually why I wanted to start a Yelp account! I can see myself returning once in a while if I`m willing to wake up really early on a weekend morning. Beware of the very limited parking, and prepare to do street parking.<26<1<2017<19<8<46
teQH9RzXa09IcTafS5BZdg<fSjgPtPhAvKekitxjkjw6w<utIA0LyQmwP-9DRyxUe6qQ<2<1<1<0<"Unimpressed overall.  We knew there would be a wait when we arrived. We were quoted 45 minutes to an hour and we ended up waiting about 1.5 hours because they were running a little behind. We expected this, so it wasn`t a big deal. What we didn`t expect was having to wait an additional 30 minutes for our food to arrive after we placed our orders.   We sat next to the kitchen, so we were able to witness firsthand how inefficient the kitchen was. I have never worked in a kitchen, so I might not know what I am talking about. But I`m pretty sure it`s not a good sign when food only leaves the kitchen every 5-10 minutes in this large of a restaurant and servers are crowding the front of the kitchen waiting for entrees to deliver. I went to the bathroom and saw 6 empty tables. Surprising, considering how many people were waiting to be seated. I think they intentionally left some tables empty since the kitchen was backed up.   The food was average at best. I ordered the breakfast pot pie. The individual components (flaky pastry, gravy) were delicious, but just didn`t work well together. The gravy made the pastry really soggy. My husband ordered the spuds deluxe. The hash browns were crispy on the outside, but sort of wet on the inside, not soft and fluffy. The pancake flight was most disappointing. We tried the blueberry danish, sweet potato, and pineapple upside down cake. The sweet potato pancakes taste nothing like sweet potato. Actually, I couldn`t taste much of any of the pancakes because every inch was smothered in syrup, butter, and sugary toppings. I love sweets, but these pancakes were practically inedible. Lastly, we ordered quesadillas from the kids` menu for our son. They were supposed to be cheese, egg, and potato quesadillas, however, there were no eggs or potatoes in them. They don`t even have plain cheese quesadillas on the kids` menu, so I don`t know how they managed to make this mistake. We decided to let it go since we didn`t want to wait another 30 minutes for it to be corrected.   Would not come back. They have a lot to work on, especially operationally. I think two stars is pretty generous. Just hit '"snooze'" this weekend and sleep in, you`ll be disappointed you woke up early to wait in line here."<16<10<2016<17<40<57

kOlr26lSKMgfP0OhtFRPLw<jMaSRdh090v8EsSKrsEQ2g<utIA0LyQmwP-9DRyxUe6qQ<4<0<0<0<This is my second time coming here. The first time I came here I would have rated this place 3 stars for a couple of reasons.  For starters the wait was an hour and thirty minutes long. But don`t worry you can keep yourself busy by walking to a coffee shop down the street (Southside expresso which has lovely coffee) near by and then snooze will call you when you`re next in line. That time I had the pancake flight which was not my cup of tea ; they were cold and overly sweet. But I also  had the eggs benedit III which were delicious. So overall mediocre experience.  This visit - I decided to give it another try on a Thursday morning around 8:30am: no wait. There was still no parking cause that lot is small but no worries there`s so much parking on the street! Already my experience felt better. I had the French toast neat which was delicious. So good! Perfectly sweet without it being overly done. They have a cream that`s on there that you can spread onto your French toast that taste like the cream in cannolis which was yummy. By the time I got to them they were a but cold and I really still enjoyed them. I also shared the eggs benedit III and chicken pot pie both of which I enjoyed.   PRO TIP: do yourself a favor and get all the hash browns flat and crispy soooo much better  !    That`s all from me y`all :)<7<2<2019<15<29<40

Pour le menu, même principe, la carte se trouve dans le milieu d`un livre savamment choisi, comme une oeuvre sur les vedettes de cinéma par exemple.  '"Speakeasy'" je voyais ça comme un bar feutré avec peu de lumière, des bougies et des sofas, mais finalement le décor et très '"chasse'" avec des têtes de gibier empaillées accrochées aux murs. Pas mal de tables sur plusieurs étages pour parer à l`exiguité de l`endroit, la réservation est donc nécessaire si vous souhaitez dîner à une heure de grand achalandage, sinon passé 22h pas mal de places se libèrent et la cuisine reste ouverte jusqu`à minuit ce qui n`est pas si fréquent à Montréal.  Au bar et aux fourneaux, la gente masculine est à son affaire. Les cocktails s`enchaînent avec dextérité non sans un certain sens du spectacle. Un résultat aussi bon à boire que distrayant à regarder.

The home burger is the best in Canada and possibly the world.  The fries are fresh cut and always good. The Onion rings are addictive. Even their wings are amazing. My only complaint, the regular burger is not that good.  Its what they serve at Johnny`s.   That frozen processed patty.

They had diagnosed her with conversion disorder and during her visit to Arizona from Kansas, I became so distressed watching her attacks that I took a referral from a friend who goes to Dr. Evidente and emailed last minute to see if she could see him during her 1 week trip. He had a cancellation and spend at least an hour (probably more) hearing her story, doing a thorough test and then inducing an attack. He then showed us videos of the disorder he felt she had and booked 4 hours of tests a couple of days later. Her insurance wouldn`t cover it and he gave us discounted rates to pay cash. The technicians and nurses were excellent, and the front desk excellent at explaining the billing process. By Friday he was almost certain he had a diagnosis but is running a genetic test to be sure. This doctor was an absolute God-send and I highly recommend a visit to him if you have an undiagnosed movement disorder. He is very qualified, extremely experienced and seems to have devoted his life to treating patients. While we were in the waiting room there were people arriving who had flown in for their annual visit to see him. I am grateful God lead us in his direction.

They will outright try to rip you off charging a $12 '"Brady Fee'", or as I heard on person working there call it '"Brady Tax'".  They claim it is to '" help offset our costs associated with the Brady Gun Control Act.'" on their website. Well, the only requirement under that law that was not present before is that they must call in and do your background check to a toll free number. So they are charging you $12 to make a phone call. A free phone call.   All other paperwork requirements were the same since the 60`s.  But wait, it gets worse. The background check is only required for long guns. Here in NC a person buying a handgun is required to have either a purchase permit of CCW. All the employee of Hyatts must do is staple the purchase permit to the form, the form that was already required long before the Brady law, or simply write down the CCW permit number.

It was a terrifying experience and my career was in danger of being seriously crippled if convicted. DM Cantor has a very nice office and very impressive at first glance. After sitting in a waiting room for a little while a gentlemen named David J Maletta who is clearly just the salesmen of the office. He really put me at ease saying that we will be able to fight it and they will do everything they can to fight the case and the reason for the stop. Mr. Maletta really gave quite a sales pitch and made me feel like these guys were ruthless... I didn`t even interview any other lawyers, just wrote the painful check of $5,000... At first, all seemed fine, I met my actual attorney Stephen Garcia because Maletta was busy impressing people for money. Stephen had a much different attitude, it was a much more non aggressive it is what it is attitude. We got our first plea offer which was in Stephen`s opinion '"nothing special'", so we carried on with the case. Fast forward several months and we still had the same plea. I had to decide to take the plea or go to trial which Cantor would then charge me another 5K and nothing was guaranteed. All of a sudden Garcia thinks the Plea is good and I wouldn`t have gotten that plea offer if it wasn`t for him negotiating with the prosecutor! The Law Offices of David Michael Cantor literally did nothing for me, I could have gone by myself, gotten the original plea deal, gotten it over with faster, and saved the $5,000! I called the office and argued my point and Maletta got very vicious and rude, if only he would use that fight to win a court case!! Of course they argue that they did so much for me and if it wasn`t for them I would have gotten an extreme DUI, even though when we first met they said I would never get convicted of that as I was right on the line... Well, buy yourself another ugly clown painting Mr. Cantor and sleep well on your bed of money cuddled up with Maletta!

I came in yesterday for a free AC check that I was told would take about 45 minutes. 2 hours later, they '"diagnosed'" a broken fan (didn`t specify which fan of the two) and quoted me at over $500 to fix my AC. Not only did Brake Masters give me an incorrect diagnosis, they also inflated the price to repair this '"issue'" multiple times over what it should cost if that WERE the issue. I brought my car to a different mechanic (Bullitt Automotive on Apache/McClintock- truly genuine mechanics!!) and they were able to nail my ACTUAL issue in 30 minutes, and turns out the plug for my fan motor was just loose. The staff at Brake Master`s deliberately lied to me, told me parts were broken that were not, and tried to get me to pay way more than I should have. Luckily, I was smart enough to give them a fat HELL NO and see a REAL mechanic that fixed the issue FOR FREE.

Went here cause this specific location usually is awesome about actually COOKING their fry`s and not giving you a sad and raw excuse of a French fry. Unfortunately that was not the case yesterday. I had ordered 2 #3`s with French frys well done (so they are actually cooked and not the raw chunks of potatoes that they normally give out) the first time I asked for them well done, the girl blatantly ignored my request for cooked frys and when repeating my ordered, I noticed she missed the part about them being cooked. So I asked her again can you please make those well done. I received the reply '"sorry We don`t serve well done anymore.'" So we went to the location around the corner who was more than happy to serve us actually COOKED French frys.

And you may know she consulted on the new Tryp Hotel`s Over Eden and Brick House.   But I want to highlight her amazing event space in Homewood. It`s a hip, post industrial large room that serves for elegant dining.  She has a cadre of loyal employees that have worked with her for many years, some go back at least as far as her celebrated E2 restaurant in Highland Park. They are well trained and graciously welcoming.   The food is wonderful, and the formula is always locally sourced fresh ingredients. Great salads, stunning entrees, and lots of great accompaniments, such as olives, fresh veggies, and breads. Italian/Mediterranean Cuisine is her go-to style of cooking, but I feel she does everything well.   So don`t forget about her event space, it`s for groups of 25 or more.   I forgot to mention her stunning desserts. Last night she served a delicious Pot de Creme that was both gourmet and very satisfying. It doesn`t get any better than this.<18<11<2019<13<41<19

They did a good job st transforming the place from what was previously a smoothie shop into a nice restaurant.  Our waitress was extremely nice and provided helpful suggestions, and the service was really good. In terms of the food, it is a nice place to order  1-2 dishes per person, and to share it with the table. While the food was all interesting, some dishes were better than others. Our favorites were the fried chicken, cauliflower and the cod cakes. We also ordered shakshuka but it was okay at best. To be fair, my family grew up with traditional Shakshuka, so while the twist on the dish was nice to see, it was not what we expected/wanted when we ordered it. We ordered all four desserts, and really only liked the tahini sundae.  Overall, it`s a really refreshing restaurant for the Cleveland area, and provides a lot of options for vegans and vegetarians especially. While I personally think the food is pretty good, I can see a lot of people loving the place.<25<11<2019<20<26<57

I`m now an owner of 7 of their bags and keep coming back for more.  On my most recent trip I purchased my very first noir bag and was specifically looking to replace my older everyday pochette that carries just the essentials (wallet, chapstick, & cell phone). Since phones keep getting bigger I needed something just a tad larger as my current bag couldn`t hold everything any longer. I was shown tons of options and fell in love with the all black Félicie Pochette which just happens to be the exact size I was looking for. This particular bag also comes with two inserts (a card holder and a zipped up pocket that can be used individually).   Louis builds incredible products that are meant to last forever. These products are also timeless. Thank you to everyone who works there who always takes extra good care of me and is patient while I`m trying to make some difficult decisions as to which goodie to take home with me.

The restaurant inside was much bigger than I expected, with three levels of seating, including a full bar area on the lower level. Our service was quick, with the waitress answering our questions and making suggestions for us. Since one person in our group does not eat pork, and their main broth appeared to include pork, she made a great recommendation of subbing miso broth and adding fried chicken on top of the ramen. We appreciated how flexible/accommodating they were with their menu items!   We each got something a big different, but I personally tried the inferno ramen as a big fan of spice. It had a great flavor (similar to ma-la, but more chili flavor and less peppery) and was delicious with the brisket. The portion seemed fair for the price and everything appeared to be freshly prepared. I didn`t try others` ramen, but everyone seemed to enjoy their meal.

Yes, they seem to have every conceivable part for whatever your needs are, but that`s about where the customer service stops.

After standing in line for 30 minutes or so, I get called to the counter. But, did I get my core charge back? Nope! Do to the fact that there was some valve missing, and I didn`t bring the used part back in the box that the new part came in, they would not even accept the part what-so-ever. No discount core charge, no nothing. So, this place will never get another dollar from me. It used to be a great store. Now it`s just a piece of crap with no customer service.

The bar is actually pretty cool:  lots of sports memorabilia, plenty of flatscreens to watch the action, and of course, video poker machines on the bar to keep you shelling out your dough.  Drinks were fine, and we were having a good time until the end of the visit, when the bartender brought over the credit card receipt.  My brother signed her copy, left her a tip, and placed it back on the bar.  So management can find this wonderful employee, this was on Saturday, March 2, 2019... maybe 11:00 PM?  The intelligent and talented young lady tending bar picked up the book (containing the customer copy... which my brother had left inside, unsigned) and walked over to the register.  Once there, she found the unsigned customer copy and started whining loudly to her manager/fellow employee:  something about *Can you believe this sh_t... didn`t even leave me a tip*.    The bartender then walked back down to us and THREW THE RECEIPT at us, saying '"This is worthless to me, where`s that guy he needs to sign this and he didn`t leave me a tip.  My sister in law, who overheard her tantrum and witnessed her dumbass move of throwing the customer copy at the customer said, '"Your copy is here on the bar, signed.  And my husband left you a nice tip, but he shouldn`t have!'"  We got up and left, but should have found a guest relations person and watched her get fired.  In the spirit of giving and gratuity, however, I`d like to offer our bartender some additional tips:  1.  Use your eyes for more than a place to store your fake K-Mart eyelashes. Like seeing your receipt copy on the bar.  2.  Be nice to customers.  They`re not always right (despite the adage) but there always the customer.  3. Don`t eat yellow snow.   Thanks, Treasure Island, we hardly knew ya.  Golden Circle, I hope that enchantress you have working the register gets some much needed training on basics like smiling and customer service.

And at one time Wynn`s Buffet could proudly strut its robes among the royalty of the many high-end restaurants found throughout this wonderland..... but like all that have ruled, it shows its age.  To support its extravagance its price has gone up significantly since I last ate here, now $54.99 for dinner on Saturday.  The decor has changed too, though I think in a beautiful manner.  Less traditional classy to a brighter and vibrant, livelier surrounding with pillowed chairs and flowery colors throughout.  But the food has definitely been impoverished.  Now everything is served lukewarm, and half the food is only fit for peasants.  Sushi that would offend the wealthy Japanese visiting.  Chinese pork belly that is inedible to aristocrats from China.  Pizza that must be laughable to the travelers from Italy.  Does the Wynn still wish to portray the grandeur of the best of America?

An hour later, I drove away with my summer wheels and used tires on.  No charge for the work getting the mangled locking studs off.  I thought I had a bent wheel, but David the tire guy told me it was a warped rotor.  I saw my mechanic and he agreed.  They have a new customer-me.  Nice work, American Automotive.<15<5<2019<7<53<21

sXYnzu2e9SbV6NdRlg66vg<gTNJye4cSFmYfdBQAwcTTg<obULsqXLYvIRy-QRgSlrtg<5<2<0<2<I recently played in the Winter pinball league for the first time.  They have about 20 pinball machines in the store. I`m no expert, but they all always seem clean and to run very well.  The pinball league players meet once a week (you pick your day) and play 6 machines each week. You keep score and at the end of the season there is a pinball tournament for prizes. The league costs $15 to join + the money for the games each week. It`s a pretty good diversion to the winter blues that tend to happen in Cleveland.  The store also has a bunch of cards, games, and comics which I can say that I know nothing about.  But, the pinball is fun, so I`m sure I`ll be be back for another league sometime.<8<2<2015<20<41<47

kqgyVihmSxKaJfg4qRS6rw<Tnr3D0nj8vjUBQGct80t6Q<ThNGovQZjZ5mn-ZwX_N2BQ<2<2<1<0<This hotel is a refurbished version of the Imperial Palace, so the infrastructure is really old. This shows itself in its ugliest form in three areas: elevators, circulation on casino floor and garage.  There are simply not enough elevators and it is common to wait 15 minutes for an elevator. Unacceptable. The smoke smell on the casino floor is significantly worse than other casinos on the strip- the ceiling is lower and I assume they do not have a top notch ventilation system. Thirdly, the garage smells and I have been told that it floods when it rains- and the smell lingers for sure.   Now for the good- the rooms were clean and beds comfortable. On the bad side, my room didn`t have a clock. Never seen this in a room before...It also didn`t have an ironing board, but housekeeping brought one after in requested one along with hangers as there were only 4 in the room.   As with all Vegas hotels, there is a resort fee. The resort fee covers two devices on the internet- each additional device is $14.99. That can get expensive if more than one person is staying in the room.   Last but not least- the location is fantastic. It is right in the heart of the strip and if you want a clean room to be a homebase- the Linq is a good bet. Just get ready to wait for the elevators.<24<9<2019<13<36<19

We ordered the Maine lobster roll and cajun waffle fries to share. The lobster roll was pretty good. The roll was pretty small and $25.

5Z0XHDnkJDIQP1O_l5375A<TnPD7uV7dlMh7kPdZA7W4Q<eXw22FQ7jv3Ma2kqfI3Lrg<3<1<0<0<UPDATE: I spoke with the service manager, David, and he was super nice. He explained the miscommunication and offered a resolution that I didn`t expect. The most I wanted was at least more training for the technician or advisor. I told him I`d be in touch if mom wanted to pursue it. I changed my rating to 3 stars....pending the outcome.     Let me start by saying I would recommend the sales team but not anything to do with service. My elderly and frail mother was at this dealership this past Friday due to a recall for an airbag. She must have appeared to be an easy mark. I begged her to wait so I could go with her but she is still trying to hold on to her independence. Anyway, while there they did an overall inspection of her vehicle for some reason. Not sure why but it doesn`t matter. So they recommended about $1,500 worth of service they stated she needed to have. Gave her the impression it was very urgent because it had to do with her brakes. Pretty much put fear in her if she didn`t have it done. I advised her that we will have it looked at elsewhere. my mother barely drives 4000 miles a year. And these last six months she hasn`t been able to drive at all due to her declining health. So I figured this was not accurate. Yesterday we took it somewhere else and they advised none of the work that was recommended was of any kind of emergency and needed to be done right now. Sooooo, yes.... I`m not happy. I mean.... the fact that they felt necessary to scare an older woman really pisses me off. Let alone the fact that it is my mother. I call and ask for the service manager after leaving this other Service Place. I was hung up on by Brandon once he knew why I was calling and didn`t want to leave a message. Sooo... I call back and ask to speak to a general manager. I got a sales manager instead. I don`t recall his name right now but once I do I will update. He assured me that he would get with the general manager this morning and that manager would be in touch with me today. Obviously that didn`t happen and that`s why I`m here. Now I`m sure there`s nothing that could be done as my mom did not have the service done. My goal here is to warn others to not use their service dept. Or make sure you get a second opinion ASAP.  Shame on you for trying to deceive the elderly!!!<13<8<2019<21<5<22

When I first moved there, the HOA team, security, etc. made it feel like you were living with your parents. I immediately then couldn`t wait for my lease to run out. When the new HOA took over, not only have they fixed an abundance of things that I was told was working when I moved in but wasn`t like the water softener, fires by the jacuzzi, etc. They are much more on point with bringing packages down to the front desk if you don`t happen to be home when it is delivered. They make it easy for dry cleaning drop off and pick up, getting your car washed, and, the new staff is amazing, professional and you feel like you are truly living in a high rise like NYC or Miami.

We recently stayed at the Scottsdale Resort hoping to really experience the true Arizona resort culture and it was nothing as we had expected. Now we were here only for one night, and it was just enough for us to decide that we didn`t want to spend another night there.  The first thing was the was customer service... the desk was quite rude in the fact that I had reached out prior to our stay in regards to the waiving the resort fee and the were most definitely not helpful. We spent about 3 hours trying to clarify who was actually in charge of the space.   Second, we were placed in the most difficult room to access. It was by far the farthest from the front lobby, no elevator nearby and no easy access to anywhere else on the resort. It was quite sad that it was also super difficult to get to the parking lot.   Third, the room was quite sad with ripped wallpaper and some stains here ant there... you`d think as a hotel, cleanliness is number 1 priority, but for this place it was not.  There were many other issues in regards to our sad experience, but all of these amazing other reviews can provide other details. Scottsdale is a beautiful place and there are many other options for you to spend your '"staycation'".  Grade: D"<12<11<2019<15<36<38

It turns out that Anthony no longer works for the company and that they had no record of any quote for us in their system...  It was back to square one, so we scheduled ANOTHER consultation for 10/31/2019. The guy came out and gave us a quote verbally on the spot. We then called to schedule a time for the work to be done.   The work was set to be done 11/2/2019 at 10:30 am. At 10 am on 11/2 I called to confirm everything and was sent straight to voicemail. Called again at 10:30 am, 11:00 am, 12 pm no answer.

Apparently there has been some scourge of lost chickens that is driving up prices so they add a surcharge to every wing order. Conspiracy? Perhaps the Chic-fil-a cows perpetrated the biggest chicken heist in US History but thankfully the conspiracy hasn`t hit Nebraska yet. Thank you Strategic Air Command for keeping our chickens safe. Come on Teakwoods. Let`s do the math. A pound of wings is between 7-12 wings. The cost of a pound of wings has gone up, according to the WSJ, by .58 a pound.

My friend and I landed here before our spa day at Spa Lamar that`s about a 10 min walk north. We sat on the patio- being there around 11am, it was a little chilly, but the attentive staff got the fireplace on for us, which definitely added to the experience. We ordered bruschetta ($15 for 4 options) and 2 salads- raspberry chicken salad and the first one on the menu. All were perfect. Top picks for bruschetta: apple and Brie, salami and pesto, fig and marscapone, and artichoke spread. Also enjoy the burrata with bacon. Wine picks: Last August Sauvignon Blanc and Stagedive Pinot Noir. Fun bar situation here too!<18<3<2018<17<45<33

I have my last Brazilian appointment in January. I`m happy with results so far. I did 8 sessions on my underarms before they told me I shouldn`t be taking a certain vitamin with Biotin in it. I guess it`s common sense but I do believe is something they should say. Underarm hair grew back.  The 1 star review is mainly for costumer service as of lately. First few times I had Jasmine and Chelsea . They were amazing and very sweet. They both left and everyone else who stayed seems to be rude. It`s honestly uncomfortable trying to have any type of conversation with them to ease the pain of nervousness. Main person I`ve had is Britney and I`ve had a couple others here and there.

DK7mZ7bVHUZDCUp4Jo_4iw<wTfb2nfzPIyFcYQArdPtuQ<2Zxqj0hVg-2TdDidmPOPPA<5<78<47<76<What makes a great hiking trail?  Well, to name a few things:  1. Beautiful Scenery 2. Panoramic Views 3. Well Maintained, Easily Navigated Trail 4. Safety 5. Minimal Crowds 6. Clean  And those six things are my top reason for hiking Sunrise Trail.  As a native Arizonan, and avid hiker, I`ve literally hiked most of the main Arizona trails.   In college, our team used to run up Piestewa Peak on a daily basis. I`ve hiked Camelback Mountain countless times.  The problems with Piestewa and Camelback are the parking and crowds. It`s almost impossible to get parking at Piestewa during peak hours, and Camelback parking, it`s almost impossible not to get a ticket around that Paradise Valley neighborhood.  Sunrise Trail is currently not a super well known/well used trail, so there`s always a place to park. But the parking lot is pretty tiny, so I might be screwing this up for myself by reviewing this trail.  From start to finish, the trail is very pretty.  There are numerous saguaros, and other cacti all over. It`s a pretty lush trail, especially for the desert.   Obviously, in the spring, everything is in bloom, and it`s much prettier.  The trail is well designated with signage.  The first half of the trail is on the south side, and at the halfway mark, it saddles the mountain, and you can see the Phoenix valley for the first time on the trail.  I like to take some time there and get some photos.  The rest of the trail is again on the south side, until you reach the base of summit. From there, you can see the Fountain Hills valley to the north-east, and the Phoenix valley to the south-west. I`ve included a photo of that gorgeous view below.  There`s a sign there, designating the altitude and stats. From there, the trail gets a little steep and rocky. Still manageable though. It`s about five minutes to the top.  The top is a BIG payoff with 360 views of the whole valley.  Absolutely amazing!  CONCLUSION  This a very manageable trail for first timers and avid hikers alike.  Worth the trip. I love it here.  5/5 RECOMMEND  OF NOTE  *Limited Parking.  *No public restrooms.  *Water fountain at the trailhead.<13<4<2018<4<47<41

QOgrIeytS-MSC14TS2vl3w<JV4mCFFKgf_AurjiAXqq7w<8YL_Cm7lYGLfPvp5sseyrQ<5<2<0<1<I was so excited to come write this review (I haven`t written one in over a year) because my experience last night was excellent! A friend and I stopped by to take advantage of the happy hour and it really exceeded our expectations, which were already high due to Pita Jungle`s happy hour being the best value in town by far. I feel they have matched that value and then-some at The Grand Blue.   We ordered all of the items on the Pintxo list. First was the smoked eggplant which came on sliced baguette. I didn`t get much of a smoky flavor from it but it was so full of flavor I didn`t mind. The white bean hummus with shrimp was also served on sliced baguette, with capers, and it was a tasty punch of flavor with a single perfect shrimp on each piece (2 per order). Next was the crab cake, also served on baguette (1/2 of a large crab cake on each piece). The bread seems unnecessary in this case but I`m not complaining since it was so delicious! The crab cake was hot throughout with lots of crab and a tangy remoulade on top. Lastly the mini shrimp roll was super flavorful. The shrimp were perfectly seasoned and served on a soft buttery roll. My friend ordered a second shrimp roll and I ordered a second crab cake. I would eat all of these items again!  We both ordered the blue crab California roll, and this was the only unremarkable item we tried. It was good, don`t get me wrong, just nothing special. I`d probably try one of the spicier rolls next time. Each order was only 4 pieces. I feel they should clarify that on the happy hour menu, since I would assume for $5 I was getting a full size 8 piece roll like most sushi happy hours around town.  Service was excellent. Our waiter and two managers checked on us during the course of the meal. I love that they put a decanter of water on your table so you don`t have to keep flagging down waitstaff for a refill.  I am very happy to have a new seafood restaurant to explore that is reasonably priced, with a bomb happy hour. I will definitely be back to try out the dinner offerings and the make your own poke bowl. Owners - if you are reading this, please consider a location in central Phoenix!<16<11<2016<16<11<35

Only two days before my scheduled appointment, I received a call informing me that the office apparently does not take my insurance. Southwestern Eye Center had WEEKS to let me know this and give me the option to reschedule with another provider in a timely manner and they failed to do so. The fact that Southwest Eye Center had initially affirmed that I was covered by my insurance at their office and only figured it out two days before my appointment is blatantly incompetent. This is disappointing and aggravating.<2<4<2019<19<48<41

This is a chain found in TX, CO, and CA, and I happened to visit the location in Montrose in Houston. I found that the food was good, `diner like`, and fills a niche in the neighborhood. The service leaves much to be desired. I went on a Friday a bit before lunchtime and there was a 25-35 min wait, which I typically see as a good sign.   We ordered the custom omelet and the sweet potato hash. Both were good, I did find that the sweet potato dish was incredibly salty, and used extra bread from the omelet to cut the salt. We also ordered a dish to go, avocado toast. The server, who had about 6 customers to wait on (we were at the bar) did a subpar job of keeping water glasses full, checking in, and was overall pretty short with us. To the point I felt bad asking for anything. Obviously this is one person, and I`m sure there are great wait staff there, unfortunately I didn`t have that experience.<9<12<2018<17<19<16

This time it was a 45-1 hour, which was what they quoted me on the two hour wait but actually this time it was fulfilled.  Parking is pretty much street curb unless you get lucky to park on their half of the parking lot.  Carful of the potential crazy bums walking along Montrose.  My picks are the pancakes and the Benedicts.  The pancake of the day wasn`t as good as the pineapple Pancake but it`s not bad just not as impressive.  Definitely ask for the syrup to go w the pancakes.  They might give you a tiny one but I like to drown mine so definitely ask for two if you are a syrup lover.  The breakfast burrito was meh.

My friends and I came about an hour before closing and seating was not a problem. The service here was A1 as they did a great job attending to us.   For my meal, I got the Hell`s Kitchen Burger and truffle fries. The fries were almost like steak fries as they were on the thiccer side. They were delicious and the dipping sauce paired very well. The burger was good but could have been better. I felt the meat was a bit underseasoned and I had the notion that it would be spicy given the name and toppings. However, it had no heat to it!

Valet was '"full'" at 6:30 PM and it was pouring rain. Valet staff did not even open car door. One valet said we could use valet ((other cars were leaving the lot) but a second valet snapped at him. That was awkward and not so welcoming.  So boyfriend dropped me at door (AFTER he opened said door while valet stood there!) and parked far away. He walked back only to discover that valet was now open.Really?  The very second we sat down the server wanted our drink order. We had reserved table side smoked Manhattans, at their request. She was truly unhappy and questioned where we had placed that order.  Our dinners were served before we were even half done with salads. Servers said '"kitchen is working fast tonight. Your dinners are ready. Do you want me to bring them out?'" Choice was to have them served or leave them under a warming light (ruins food). Not much of a choice.   It was very obvious the goal was to turn the tables over. Common issue with chain restaurants, (Landry`s owns). We were in and out in less than 60 minutes.  When we complained to front desk she clearly did not care but certainly did not want me to write this review and was quick to point out that the valet is '"not ours'". Well, if it is part of your service then is is '"yours.'"  Horrible Valentine`s Day evening (thanks to Grand Concourse) and our second disappointing over priced dinner. $150.00 for irritation.

She is extremely knowledgeable and you can tell she really loves what she does. She made me feel comfortable from start to finish! I got the hydrafacial with dermaplaning to get me ready for my wedding! She was also sweet enough to throw in a mask for the night before to make sure I was extra hydrated and glowing for my big day.

fr71iji7kAOHFwvQxXhLJw<UauOUx_Khw-IoxNf-OKVPQ<mSBOLc7oOaWKM4O2LSP87w<5<0<0<0<Justin from Home Tech & Automation was great! When I called, he answered the telephone personally and scheduled an appointment with me for the very next day.  When I explained my issue, he provided a quote and offered a reasonable and fair price. It was such a relief to know the price in advance, rather than being surprised later. I was pleased with the interaction, as the first company that I called (not this company) regarding the installation of my Google Nest appeared to be a call center in another state, who required prepayment and wasn`t able to answer my questions.  When Justin arrived, he was knowledgeable, efficient, professional, and friendly. He finished my installation and went above and beyond to provide information about my device, show me how to navigate the app, and even patched the wall (where there was a gap from the old doorbell). If you are looking for a local company with great customer service, a fast response, and good prices, I would highly recommend using Home Tech & Automation. I will definitely reach out to them in the future for any of my own installation needs.<4<12<2019<9<32<18

Correct me if im wrong.  What i like about this location is that theres a lot of different chair/bench type right infront of the dumbbell station. Also the deadlift area has a pad that you can drop your weights too.  Location is convenient right next to 215 and eastern freeway. Has restaurants around and other retail shops.<25<10<2018<7<50<8

I needed to buy prepaid tickets $29.95 per person- manager/owner didn`t want to lose money by people not showing up for their reservations. Understood, no problem. She boasted about the menu... Sounded great. Of course that`s what we expected.  When we arrived for our reservations the disappoints piled up... The cheese and fresh fruit was near empty, picked over. No bacon, no stuffed French toast, no chicken Marcella and the small fillet of smoked salmon was in a corner, very difficult to reach. The so called dessert area with very limited choices, were cut smaller than samples at Sam`s Club. All this for $41.50 a person! Coffee and tea not included in buffet cost. Though the manager has said beverage were included in the cost of the tickets. 20% gratuity was also added to this addition billing when we couldn`t even get a second glass of water!  So very disappointed.  We did speak with the manager, in her anger fit, she continued to lie about what she has said was included with the buffet... We paid the over priced additional charges. And she throw the change at us!! Unbelievable!<27<3<2016<20<13<40

I made an appointment with Dr. Conrad Lochner one year and I felt rushed and didn`t feel that he really wanted to be there. He wasn`t very forthcoming with his opinions. He should stay in the Henderson office. Perhaps that`s why he doesn`t have the Nellis office in Yelp. This year I made an appointment with Dr. Vorapas Thunyaluku. She was great. Open and very kind, answered my questions. The office personnel: Shay she needs a customer service refresher. She cuts me off when I am speaking; she was socializing with other employees when customers were present. I didn`t hear here say `please` and `thank you` once. The other ladies were very kind and lovely to deal with - Thank you Stacey & Sadie.<16<12<2015<2<43<22

My first month I found out a drug dealer lived in the building.. the apartment faces the parking lot and lots of tenants blast music in their cars with the bass thumping, they could care less if you`re trying to nap or rest. The roaches are by the millions!   When my lease was up, the place was bought by Dasmen residential and I decided to give them a chance. I switched apartments to a '"renovated'" model.. the craftsmanship of this apartment was poor to say the least but the location of the unit was so beautiful, facing the beautiful pond so I gave it a chance. There are 37 Canadian geese that live here (I counted) and the closed in pond area gets super hot of course and with all those filthy birds and the feces, it was unbearable! The smell! The noise!! I was stuck for another year since the only way out was a ridiculously high amount of money to get out of the lease. Oh did I mention that this building also had a drug dealer.. the place looks beautiful that is a fact but what`s the point if those geese bully you attack you and smell up the place. You can`t enjoy a walk around the pond because of the odor of geese feces and they will attack you, hiss at you and scare you. The management and staff are nice but horrible at running a community! They could care less about any complaint! If you have trouble with a tenant they tell you to call the police lol my apartment cost $1,100 a month but all apartments are not renovated. Your neighbor could be paying $800... They say you have to be working to live there but 2 of my neighbors are not employed. This place is not a great place to call home! Also the pool been closed for months due to something they blame on tenants... GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!"<17<6<2019<14<33<7

A dish of '"steak'" is filled with small cuts of very tough meat that are smothered with a sauce that is actually worse than the crappy gravies Heinz sells in a can.  The carving station turkey managed to taste like fish. It`s a miracle, because I saw the guy cut the meat off of a turkey carcass. But it didn`t taste like turkey.  Surely the pasta offerings would be better. Wrong. I think they fill their cheese ravioli with toe jam. It`s terrible. Terrible.  I have a standing rule: I never rave about a restaurant`s mac`n`cheese or mashed potatoes. I believe that those two items are simply impossible to screw up and none is truly as AMAZING as people claim. However, I can honestly report that the Golden Nugget Buffet`s mac`n`cheese could very possibly be the worst ever created by human hands. Mushy, awful, chemically-tasting artificial cheesy nastiness. It`s truly crap-tastic.  Do yourself a favor. Take the $25 per person that you would spend here and bet it all on black at the next roulette table you pass. It`s a better value for your money."<4<6<2013<5<3<43

Drove up to the drive thru. The person in front of us is waiting quite some time. My mom said they must just be short-staffed and we gotta wait. FINALLY, the person drives up. So I am there waiting. And waiting. I yell hello at the mic. Nothing. Try a few more times, nothing. So I drive up. I see the car that was in front on me, there at the pick up window. When it is finally my turn, I ask if their system isn`t working. He tells me oh yeah. I suggested that they put a sign up or something cause the person in front of me waited, I waited, and there was someone else behind me. No response. I make my order and then wait there at the window for the food. When I finally drive off, I see the poor person who was behind me still at the order screen. Sheesh. My food was fine though - I will give them that.<8<12<2019<2<27<56

It`s loud and it`s small and it`s not particularly a classy place to eat.  If you want to get drunk and eat chips and burgers maybe watch the game--then you will be ok there but if you want a good meal that tastes like someone made it with care then this will not be for you.  On the positive the waitresses know there trade and you won`t have issues with them forgetting your menu.  This is a bar that serves food don`t expect more than that and you will be alright.<9<12<2019<16<22<6

It is the new sister restaurant of Chiang Mai in Etobicoke. Parking is not TOO bad during the night for dinner, but I`m not sure about the day since there are quite a handful of restaurants and shops (optometry, dental, pharmacy, etc.) in the same plaza.  I`m been here a couple times already with my family and Yelp friends, and I absolutely enjoyed the experience! The staff are super accommodating and friendly, and even went above and beyond with their service! Definitely call in to make large group reservations, they are getting much more busy!  I love how you can adjust the the spicy level for most of the dishes here. There is mild, medium, spicy, and THAI SPICY lol. By all means if you`re up for the challenge ;) Mild is already a tad spicy for me... I know I`m weaksauce hahaha XD  Food items I would recommend ordering: - Satay Chicken Skewers - Fried Shrimp Rolls - Khao Soi with Chicken (my favourite dish) - Thai Basil Fried Rice with Beef, I love basil! - Royal Pad Thai with whatever protein you like, I went for the Lobster ;)  Food items I didn`t enjoy as much: - Famous Pad Thai, it was a bit too salty for me - Coconut ice cream, it was melting and I didn`t like the sauce on the top  I`d definitely be back again for my Thai food cravings. That Khao Soi was unforgettably good.<22<11<2019<17<24<49

I wish I had known that before I wasted thousands of dollars on a vacation package  that I cannot use and is just like any old school timeshare. They claim you can stay almost anywhere anytime. No. You can stay in very few places and at very select times. I called today and after 3 transfers and a very long hold time they said that city was blacked out for 2 YEARS. They also seem to care very little that their website issue has prevented many owners from being able to log in and book for weeks. Terrible customer service, very low value product, and shady business as a whole. Extremely disappointed that I invested in this scam of a company.<9<12<2019<21<40<3

If this is how this office handles appointments with clients, I am concerned about keeping other deadlines for sensitive legal matters.

Used 2 coupons, one for 4 chicken tenders and a biscuit ($3.99) one for 5 pieces legs and thighs, 2 sides (got mashed potatoes and gravy and cole slaw) and 2 biscuits. ( $5.99) Asked for all thighs no problem. Everything was hot and correct. Only problem was the taste of the chicken...very bland. Applied liberal amounts of garlic salt and lemon pepper it helped somewhat also the tenders are kinda dry and pale looking. I think if you cook the all white meat tenders to a crisp golden brown the meat will be way over cooked. Hence the paleness. In all fairness not bad for $10 and change and fed 3 hungry adults.<3<3<2015<9<23<26

MORE lecture on how my jargon is wrong and I need to know what to ask for and blah blah blah I finally say '"I really don`t need to learn all your internal processes and know your language all I want to do is drop this off and get a confirmation you took it'"   Then AGAIN she tries to lecture me on proper jargon and how I need to know and is still babbling away.   Then she hands me my piece of paper and guess what it says on it??!!!! RECEIPT.  Are you kidding me ? You just wasted three mins of my day berating me In front of another customer to make a list about how wrong I am and your magic machine prints a label that says receipt on it?   Please train your customer service reps that it is bad customer service to use industry jargon with the customer.   Please tell her to save her lectures for her kids or husband or partner as they`re not a good business practice to retain customers   Please change the name of '"receipt'" on the top of your '"receipt'" to say what this employee told it needs to say so at least when she lectures the next person she will be right for her significance train!   #epicfail"<21<12<2017<16<34<59

The paint work was flawless. I dropped my Acura off on a Friday morning with a enterprise rental car waiting. The GEICO and Wilburn rep were so nice, understanding and calm. I`m a car guy, our cars are always clean and tuned to perfection. They assured me that it would be as good as new. With daily updates, quick response to questions or concerns I was very comfortable while my car was in the shop. The work was done ahead of schedule. Picked up my car today. It was like it never happened, The paint work was outstanding! Hopefully I don`t have to go through another incident again but if I do I will always take my cars to Wilburn!

The staff all greeted me with happy faces and sat my family and I down immediately. We all got our food in a timely manner. They were on it with their customer service.   Their food was delicious. We ordered popcorn shrimp, soft shell crab, and takoyaki as appetizers. I`m very picky with takoyakis since it`s one of my favorite foods, but theirs wasn`t bad. It`s way better compared to other places. Their soft shell crab was delicious, as well as their popcorn shrimp. I definitely recommend them.   I`m a huge garlic fan so I had to order the black garlic ramen, and it did not disappoint me. If not made right, garlic can overpower the entire bowl, but it wasn`t with this case.

I was tasked with the glorious planning of a best friend and future husband`s wedding shower antics for a nice sized group of 20 peeps who wanted to have some drinks and be merry - who can blame `em?    Being that I lived in Albuquerque at the time and had only a month or so before coming back to Cleveland for the winter break, I did what any strong elder millennial would do, and hit the Google hard.  Tireless evenings were spent searching for the perfect location that screamed intimate yet exciting, fun but important, classy but still, not that serious.  At long last Yelpers (by golly we`re so lucky to use Yelp the way we do now) I stumbled across an adorable looking pub that just so happened to also have bocce ball, one of my friends and I`s favorite pastime.  Fate was looking out and/or Googs had my back - something like that.  Everyone was super friendly and the staff was on point with our reservation, making sure the tables were set up properly, well decorated, that we had the entire bocce ball court to ourselves... it was honestly so perfect for our group and I couldn`t have been any happier!  In addition, the food and cocktails were delish and not a single belly went unhappy.  As an updated portion to this review, I also recently revisited the pub since I`ve moved back home to CLE and you guys - the Happy Hour deals are on POINT.  The fantastic bocce ball court still exists.  The exterior ambiance is gorgeous with the wood and bricks everywhere, creating a garden-like vibe while you dine.  I love this place!!!  Nothing better than combining an old timey great feeling vibe with the modern deliciousness of fantastic cuisine.<29<10<2019<19<11<43

I have the shrimp and fish . The presentation was great . Taste was more like  the Sauces held all flavor but no flavor in corn tortillas nor protein . Must season on all levels . I`ll come back one day just for drinks tho . Good Tuesday Tequilla deals !<4<12<2019<0<23<49
S9lXYRZNvjpgasWbnYFhkg<PHriMvwmqXv5C0fdFtXIhQ<ucF6f0eni3nGjczwLyWRLw<2<0<0<0<I`ve been hesitating for a good year to post this review. We have been seeing Dr. Gracia for 8 years and love her. However, the waiting time is beyond ridiculous. We always wait a minimum of 1 hour from our appointment time until we are seen. This has been happening for years. I`ve always given her and her staff the benefit of the doubt that maybe something out of the ordinary happened that day and that`s why they are running behind but now when it happens every single time I can`t overlook it.   I understand that each appointment is different and patients require different treatments but at some point there has to be a line. If office visits are consistently behind and having to wait way beyond their appointment time something has got to change.   To me it comes down to respect. As patients we are expected to be on time and if not most office allow you a late window but if you exceed that time frame you have to reschedule. I feel the same for mine time. My time as a patient is just as valuable as the doctors and staffs.    So unfortunately due to the wait times I`m ready to switch doctors.<5<12<2019<0<54<6

Experiences have between mixed, very good to bad with the best experiences from the firearms purchase perspective and not so good/bad from the gunsmith & service perspective.  Like their website and (email) newsletter/sales alerts.  Hard to beat them for selection, including used items, but easy to beat them on price - even when they negotiate.  Staff is generally helpful but be sure to ask your questions and best to support with your own research.  No range onsite.<12<12<2015<16<30<47
scCEi9hoCMec4QuxUvSIEg<sPmSz2v8xnOMubkriyum3w<5WXuCu34Ri7peVWKSFrHVw<1<9<1<1<"Really unhappy with my last experience with red bloom, and I won`t be going back.   I hadn`t been to a salon in a few years, I had just let my hair grow and it was almost to my bum. I wanted to cut my hair and go lighter.  I made an appt, (with Jodie Lynn) and was told I would need to come in for a consult. At the consult things seemed great, Jodie showed me pictures of colour, we discussed doing balayage, and she cut a small swatch of my hair and said she would see how it lightened up. I also showed her the picture of how I wanted my hair cut. I had high hopes.   When the appt came, I was sat down and asked to fill out a sheet that asked how chatty I was feeling, how the health of my scalp was, and which two complimentary services I would like today. I thought that was pretty cool, and remember my previous stylist from this salon used to always give me hand massages and I loved them, so I choose hand massage and aroma therapy. I handed the sheet to Jodie and neither of those happened. Jodie seemed to have forgotten everything, but I didn`t mind refreshing her memory, showing her the picture of how I wanted my hair cut, and that I wanted to go lighter. Then she also mentioned she lost my swatch of hair..which I thought was odd. But she said '"it lightened up nicely'". I was very clear I wanted my hair cut two inches below my chin, so it was just slightly above my shoulders, and she confirmed that with me.   She then proceeded to do foils on my whole head- not balayage. She cut my hair to my chin, not two inches below, and my hair was uneven. I asked for it to be cut blunt, and one side was very obviously shorter than the other. When I compared the sides in front of her she said '"that`s how blunt cuts are'" ummm what? They`re uneven? She didn`t offer to fix it.   Also what I found very off putting, they asked all of their clients to fill out the '"best of calgary'" survey choosing red bloom in front of them. While my hair was processing I was also asked to do this. It seemed very high pressure, and I don`t agree with it. I wanted to say no, but I also didn`t want to look like a bitch in front of other people or have Jodie screw up my hair in spite so I felt I had to. When the customer is leaving the salon, why not ask them to vote on their own? Maybe offer $5 off the next service if they do the survey, if you`re so desperate to get votes. Instead you bring them an iPad and hover over them to ensure they are choosing red bloom? Not impressed at all."<10<2<2019<17<25<46
1_lRPTye_uYFJuTZvAOreQ<8fOJIYSRhosJ_vEFXPdV9Q<IyzNiC1EtRka3wJAUUXiXQ<5<0<0<0<I bought my vehicle with aftermarket rims which I was not a huge fan of back in August of 2017. I ran through a few scenarios in my head of what I wanted to do and I decided to either powder coat or paint my rims for now. I went on to yelp and did a search and found Christian and Bailey of Dipped auto works. They responded super fast to all the questions I had and were able to schedule me at a time convenient to me. The day had come and they even called me before to confirm I was coming.   At this point, to be honest, I was expecting to roll up to a business building only to find me driving to a house, in which I was a little bit skeptical about. BUT DONT BE SCARED OR WORRIED! I met Christian and Bailey and they went on to tell me about themselves and what they do. They were super friendly, let me ask all the questions I wanted, and were extremely professional. These Vegas Born guys definitely know what they are doing and I am always proud to support local businesses.   Now for the work they do. I am SO HAPPY with the job they did. It brought new life to my vehicle. My rims that just didn`t seem to look right just look absolutely amazing. I get so many looks and compliments on my car. My friends tell me how fantastic it looks all the time.   I will gladly come back to see these guys over and over again knowing that I will receive quality work and excellent service. I highly highly recommend these guys.   Thank you Christian and Bailey for the excellent experience!<24<4<2018<23<48<20

It is located in a gas station and I had no clue a gas station food can looked not only good but also taste good. Everything is made fresh from scratch so it takes some time but oh boy I should definitely give it to them everything was spot on, from seasoning to freshness to presentation.   People might find it little expensive for a gas station  food. But you should also get what kind of protein you are getting.   The dish I ordered was tempura luxe with bun and sunny side up on top. The bread was nicely toasted in butter and the smell of butter was there on every bite of the bread. The protein was well cooked. Then came the sunny side up on top. Wow it was delight to watch and even more delightful to eat. Standing up to their tag line '"Sophisticated Street Eatery'".  Definitely recommended and will come back for sure."<24<11<2019<0<37<46
LZ3Ws5nJdK-m7UjGMDbNWw<sKy_XjeFHLkaeUL5qbBl8g<W9P1lr_W0qWFpf0tLtheGg<1<7<1<0<"So Regret Placing My Dad Here.  They sent my dad to a psychiatric hospital almost an hour away, without authorization, they didn`t even have a brochure of the place he`d been sent to much less know the ratings of that facility. You`d think a place that considers itself a care facility for Alzheimer`s patients (and is insanely expensive) would know how to take care of their patients better.   So now my dad is in a psych hospital that SILVERADO MEMORY CARE knows nothing about, and they can`t tell me what`s happening with his care. I spoke face-to-face with a staffer at Silverado to try to find out what`s happening with my dad, when I discovered Silverado didn`t know anything about that other facility I asked her, '"Don`t you think this is a problem that you don`t know?'"  She said no.   I asked for a copy of the contract that my mom had signed when my dad moved in, thinking well maybe mom signed off on this and didn`t realize it. Once the contract was in my hands I asked the staffer - where is the section on transferring and transporting patients?  Her answer, '"Oh, that`s not covered in there.'" Really? So you can ship my dad wherever and his rights aren`t even covered in the contract? Wow.   Bottom line, Silverado thinks it`s OK to ship off their patients to unknown places without even checking credentials themselves, much less supplying that information to the family. So mad, and so worried about my dad right now. Please don`t end up in the same situation - do not choose Silverado."<12<9<2014<16<36<29

Today is day 3 of a soft opening. I drove by not even aware of the place and the furniture caught my eye. Kindly greeted by Tracy she gave me the history on the store and showed me around the place. Not expecting to make a purchase I found two pieces that I`m excited about. A nice media center and a matching console. Both her and Justin were super nice made the shopping experience a fun one.

It was my first time there and I was beyond impressed and blown away with not only the food and service but the owner himself taking time to talk with us and speaking some deep truth. It`s rare to find someone or at least meet people with that sort of passion and it`s very uplifting. . Now...on to the food! Started off with an excellent cocktail followed by some delicious starters: Reuben egg rolls, Cajun bbq prawns and mussels. All of the food was so good but my personal fav was the egg rolls, *yummmmmmy- ace Ventura voice*  Next was the entree and I went with the fish and chips! The fish came out perfectly cooked and was some of the best Alaskan cod I`ve had before, the fries were delicious and was a very balanced meal.  . Just when I thought this amazing evening couldn`t get any better, dessert came out... I`m talking chocolate chess pie, just stop. I could honestly eat that pie everyday of my life haha. And my first time tasting a crepe brûlée and I loved it. They hit the desserts and really everything out of the park.

The restaurant is clean inside with friendly employees ready to take your order. The menus next to the register make it easy for those of us that can`t read at a distance.   The Cochinita Torta was really good. The meat had a nice flavor and the sauces and vegetables paired well with the meat. The Carne Asada Torta was the best of the two because there was even more flavor than the Cochinita. Both overall had great tasting meat, tasty sauces, and good vegetables. One Torta was a large enough portion for me, but a man might need a side to make it a whole meal. The torta was on a large bread, but not overly packed.  The sides were great. The Mexican Corn was served off the cob with the traditional toppings of mayo, cojita, and cilantro. The guacamole and chips were my favorite item. The guacamole had the perfect texture and seasoning. I could eat this without chips, but it helped that the chips were delicious too. I`d order both of these sides again.  Overall, very tasty food at a fair price. I`ll be back!<26<10<2019<15<20<2
V3yeybVDTb7vhTTWX3p-rA<y-zR1tPl64UaaVJhMBq6Ow<MnO_mAkkOOxYuxir_E6d4Q<5<0<0<0<We love Impact! My daughter started gymnastics  almost two years ago. We asked around to find a gym that not only did a great job teaching gymnastics but also had a good environment that I want my daughter to be in. After hearing great feedback from lots of folks, we enrolled at Impact, even though there are two other gyms closer to us. I`m so glad we did! The coaches are kind but also teach good discipline and hard work. My daughter has improved so much and just made the competitive team. You hear so many horror stories about the world of gymnastics and I really didn`t want my daughter`s sense of self worth to be based entirely on her gymnastics abilities. Impact is like a family and they encourage the girls to not only train hard but to be encouraging of their teammates. They teach them to be good people as well as great athletes. My son is now enrolled in the Ninjas program as well and he has a huge grin on his face every class- he loves it! Not sure why anyone would write a negative review, we love it here. Well worth the extra travel time.<13<12<2019<1<56<7

I enjoyed how the apartment complex tried to make it feel like a community by having food trucks and restaurants come out every so often.   When it comes to the apartments themselves, I feel that they were a good price for the quality and size. One complaint I had was that they wanted to charge an extra $300 for a garage. Other apartment complexes i have lived at before had only charged a small amount for a garage, $300 is way too much! I will also say that the utilities in our unit were cheap and were always breaking. Our dishwasher never worked the entire time, even after we had the maintenance worker come look at it multiple times.   The grounds were always well kept and their pool/fitness area is great, we spent a lot of time there. We never had any issues with safety, although i had heard horror stories from other people who lived there.   Overall, I feel that this is a nice community with quality apartments for a decent price!<24<11<2019<19<34<53

As a licensed cosmetologist I would not come back here, ever again. And this is all based on an eyebrow waxing appointment...  First of all, WITH AN APPOINTMENT, I waited about 25 minutes, after she told me '"it`s gonna be awhile'", I left, came back, waited.  Then the lady who did my brows was so busy and rushed she barely had time to breath. Admittedly so. She barely had time to eat or drink all day she said, and we were rounding up on the final hours....this is common in a busy salon but my brows should not have suffered for it!   They were awful. She didn`t do them properly, from start to finish. She didn`t sanitize, or prep the skin properly or at all...she just started waxing. She didn`t trim the brows, she didn`t understand the shape I wanted. My skin broke out, I`m still growing out the shape and having it fixed by a true professional somewhere else. Plus probably paid $30 to have my eyebrows ruined and paid another $30 somewhere else to have them fixed!   Initially I wanted to schedule a facial as well to come back when they had more time, however I never came back after my eyebrows experience.   I ended up having them fixed at Dallas Beauty Lounge, I waited a week for an appointment there and will go back forever."<3<8<2015<0<18<58

I`m warning everyone to RUN as far away from these awful people as you can if you`re reading this! They botched my lasik eye surgery 7 years ago. I should have written this review a long time ago. I am now looking for an eye specialist and they popped up on my search. They have caused me so much pain, agony, sleepless nights, and the list goes on and on! I tried to sue, but I couldn`t due to paperwork I signed prior to my surgery. Long story short, they blamed me because my eyes are too deep set.  I had blood shot eyes for over a month and terrible pain. I still have to wear a contact in one eye and now need to have both of my eyes corrected. They were only able to do the lasik in one of my eyes, but cut one eye in an attempt to correct It. I am scared to death to have another surgeon touch my eyes. I need to look up the surgeon that did It and post his name. He is such an evil man! Such nerve to blame me! I had my procedure done at the Phoenix location. will update my review again as soon as I find out his name. I hope the medical board shuts them down and that the Dr that ruined my eyes loses his license if he hasn`t already. There are no words to even convey to anyone how I feel still to this day. Southwestern is one of my worst lived nightmares! I will probably have to travel to another city to have my eyes fixed from a specialist that only fixes botched lasik jobs.

Service was a bit slow but the pancakes were to die for. They did comp the pancakes for us since we had a long wait for our food. Definitely will be coming back.  We ordered ...  Pancake Flight - where you can choose 3 different flavors (blueberry danish, OMG french toast, and sweet potato with pecan). The sweet potato one was hands down the best one!  The Benny Goodmen - a benedict with smoked salmon, very rich since it also has cream cheese but very flavorful.  Ham Benedict III - a traditional approach to a benedict, wasn`t bad but couldn`t quite compare to the salmon one.   Snooze breakfast Burrito - this thing was huge, but nothing special really.   The BEAT sandwich- the bacon on the blt made it better. It was thick was a side of sweetness from the maple syrup just perfection.  I had to get an extra side of bacon cause it was so good.<22<2<2017<19<52<46

Extremely frustrating.After moving us, the owner Kirk had the audacity to only discount the rate by about $20 which I declined and asked for $50. Also would leave a burning cigarette on the tailgate if my moving truck and now my couch and other fabric items still smell like shit from it days later. Due to them being so late I was charged a 2nd day for the uhaul. I am considering doing a chargeback to recoup the loss from the extra day of truck rental and because I`m gonna have to get my couches cleaned. Do not hire these guys. I would give 0 stars if I could simply on how much of a headache dealing with Kirk was.<16<11<2019<17<13<50

They will of course , take your agreed upon down payment happily and tell you that your loan is approved and how hard they worked for you. The next step is , they will then call you and demand more money using scare tactics. They will tell you that they are coming to reposes the vehicle unless you can bring more money down here today. This is actually happening to me right now . I have called the finance company, that I was told held the loan and they do . The finance company knows nothing of needing more money or a repossession order as the Truck and Auto Depot stated. I have the coupon book from the finance company and my first payment is due the 23rd . Listen FTC , shut these people down at once. Do not allow them to scam anymore people ,  re open again under yet another different name , anyone associated with or anyone who has , had or still does have the same names .

I ordered a grilled cheese for myself and one for my daughter at 6:34pm. My friend ordered after me. He asked a bunch of questions because his daughter is allergic to gluten. He had ordered burgers for himself and his daughter. They received their meals probably around 6:55pm. The girl delivering the food to the table said that my order was overlooked and they were making it now so it should be out in 5 mins. Ok, I get that they had a mad rush when we came in and it was going to take some time. At 7:05pm, I approached the counter and let them know that it has now been 30 mins for two grilled cheese. The manager said they got busy. I let him know it was unacceptable at this point. It still took another 5 mins to get our food. Not ok. At this point I`m angry and the poor girl delivering food got the brunt of it. This poor girl then comes up to me 5 mins later to give me a $10 bill. I pray that this did not come out of her pocket and out of the manager`s pocket. He still made no point to appease me. Hello Bistro, I usually like you because the food is good and the service is reasonable. You need to find a manager who knows how to perform good customer service because the one you have is doing a poor job. You also need to give kudos to the young girl delivering food to the tables for trying to make the situation better. She`s the reason this review doesn`t have one star.<1<12<2019<0<59<42
HvQWmLJaFIiCo-5SoOfgIw<73UaA1SEBfwC5cHSB_13kw<fctpzxuZN1DdBkTSe6JO0g<5<2<0<0<"This was our second purchase from Hi-Line Garage.  We love Infiniti vehicles, and need all wheel drive since we live about 2.5 hours away in Asheville.  These vehicles are difficult to locate, and Hi-Line gets them frequently.  The first purchase was an Infiniti M 35x in April 2009 and we just traded that car yesterday for an Infiniti M 37x.  We called Jimmy on Monday morning to see if the car was available, it was, so he had the car cleaned up and ready for us.  In the ever changing world of real estate, we couldn`t leave Asheville, so had to wait until Tuesday.  We showed up and the car was perfectly detailed.  Hi-Line seems to be very picky about the cars they take in, and this one didn`t disappoint at all.  Jimmy took us for a great test drive and we decided this was the car we wanted to purchase.  They were very fair on the value for our trade, and we quickly had a deal put together.  We usually pay cash or have financing arranged prior to buying, they were even able to beat the rate our credit union offered.  We were in & out very quickly.  Jimmy programmed our bluetooth and we were ready to roll.  The owner, Ali, was as nice as the first time we met him and he remembered who we were when we called the about buying this second car.  Their customer service is top notch.  Sales can be a tough business, and those not in the business of sales don`t always know what we go through.  I would venture to guess some of the other reviews are a '"bit'" exaggerated, the reviewers a bit '"sensitive'".  When someone calls me to see homes, if they haven`t been to a bank to get pre-approved, they won`t ever get to sit in my Infiniti to go look at homes.  We all have standards for doing business, and Hi-Line has earned my business again.  I`ll be to trade my SUV for another SUV soon!"<9<7<2014<19<37<31

The store is super clean with freezer and refrigerated cases of delicious ready to go meals. I had help from the lady working & decided on the chicken enchiladas. SO GOOD! I got the small size and it was enough for my husband and I. I highly recommend the large size for 3 adults and up. You could possibly feed 2 adults and a child on the small. I paired it with a salad. I also tried the cannoli and it was seriously the best I`ve ever had! I`m so glad I finally stopped in. I will be grabbing something from here at least once a week or two.

I usually am not a huge fan of these type of restaurants but my mom used to take me there throughout high school but the North Olmsted location. Anyway - it`s kind of funny but the menu hasn`t changed in about 10 years. Surprisingly, I swear it keeps getting better. Now I had the honey glazed chicken which is pictured. The chicken was delicious and it was served in a thin wanton that looked like a bag, but it is eatable! One thing to note the rice and the broccoli was severely under salted. Which is fine, but they don`t keep salt and pepper on the table. Bad move. My girlfriend had the scallops. She thankfully let me have a bit at they were delicious! It could easily be a meal for two because there are about six of them with mushrooms and rice as well. She was happy with her decision. My other friend got the shrimp dish. It came with about 9 tempura dipped shrimp and sweet potato fries and spinach. It looked good, she said though it was a disappointment there was no dressing because it became very blan flavored and dry. This place is fun, and it`s an experience more than anything. The building is divided into four rooms with each room being a different season. It`s fun, a great place to stop for dinner after shopping, the prices are good, the staff is nice, and the food is OK. The food isn`t amazing but it isn`t bad either. Will I go back? Probably, plus it`s at legacy at after a couple hours walking there, it`ll be delicious to chow down on!<27<9<2019<12<38<45

I have eaten '"pizzas'" but there was something missing. We found out about Pizza Monzu via the NextDoor app, because the restaurant is in our neighborhood of Monterey Park, off Flamingo, east of Jones. We came in tonight to appease my jonesing for a real, Italian, hand crafted pizza. Having watched Ugly Delicious` episode on pie in Naples, and Brooklyn, I was in a state. We found a very attractive, stylish restaurant with a full bar and very appealing surroundings. The kitchen is visible and they have a room upstairs as well. When Jason told us that there was a pizza the size of the table, I was swooning. For appetizers, we ordered the sweet and sour meatballs, which I had seen posted online today, and which are garnished with olives and pine nuts. The serving is generous with eight meatballs. My husband ordered the Pork Reigns pizza (pulled braised pork. house-made sausage. apple-wood smoked bacon. ham. salame calabrese. guanciale). This was an amazing topping, but honestly, the high quality of the crust is the star. I ordered the Apricot, bacon, goat cheese, pine nuts, arugula pizza and this was wonderful. There is a very delicate mascarpone dressing which you can use on any pizza, and this, too, was delicious with the pizza. We had a great Big Dog lager and an Italian white wine similar to sauvignon blanc. We each had 4 pieces of pizza, 3 of which we ate there.  Servers were very helpful with our questions. My husband was thrilled and I am so excited that this lovely restaurant is walking distance from our house. At last, we have pizza in Las Vegas, real pizza. Please check it out!!"<26<3<2018<2<43<11

The last time I went, I watched an employee make my sandwich while repeatedly wiping her nose on her gloves--ostensibly used to prevent germs from spreading--then help a colleague at the cash by repeatedly touching the computer screen and jumping back to my food. That`s not the first time I`ve seen people wipe their nose on their gloves. I get it--it`s winter, and a lot of us our sick. But at least change the gloves/wash your hands!   The store is also poorly designed in that the bagels are hidden from view when you enter and the owners expect customers to intuitively know to grab a bagel before making an order. I`ve watched countless people wait in line until they can request a sandwich/bagel + cream cheese etc., only to be advised to go grab a bagel and wait in line again.<5<12<2019<18<22<18

The owner did compensated us with a free entree and was nice about the situation from the time we walked in. My friend got the new naan (not knowing I had the old burnt stuff) and I guess they heated up the burnt naan and put it back in the foil...

I popped in here for a quick bite with the wifey before heading home for some Netflix and fall asleep on the couch. Duzan`s decor and table setup needs a major reconfiguration, there`s no cozy sit and relax vibe that most Mediterranean restaurants have. Plus it`s bright as hell in here!   That being said the food is still pretty damn good. We tried the Hummus Plate, Pita Bread with Feta, and the Combo Special. Honestly, this is probably some of the best hummus I`ve had in Vegas and the Pita bread is a great compliment; soft, light, and I found out, baked fresh at their other location. They do sell bags of the amazing pita bread for $3 and you get a giant stack of carby love.   The Pita bread with feta cheese is baked together and eats like a pizza. Feta lovers this is for you and honestly a must order if you come here. It`s a great starter.   The Combo special is a solid mix of menu items. Beef and chicken shawarma, falafel, salad, and of course hummus and pita bread. This was a Mediterranean bounty that was the perfect amount of food for sharing. The falafels were crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and very tender, but the beef on the other hand was under seasoned and lacked salt. This didn`t disrupt my meal, but I would have been upset if this was the main protein on my plate.   I will definitely come here again, if not for the bread, but hummus, and the chicken, and the falafel... you get the point.<23<11<2015<20<54<27

I had done quite a bit of troubleshooting ahead of time and could not figure out the problem. I called and spoke a lady at 10:43 pm that routed my call to a technician that [should] have called me shortly after. I didn`t hear back so at 11:23 pm I called back. The second time around I was promptly contacted by a technician. Unfortunately, the technician was 60 minutes away.   12:23 am the technician arrives and effectively troubleshoots the problem and replaces a defective part. I was able to pay with my card and sign all the paperwork electronically on the company`s tablet at 1:12 am, which made for a speedy exit after the work was done.  Had it not taken 2 hours and 29 minutes from call in to repair complete, this company would have gotten 5 stars.

Most recently, when my sister in law & I arrived for our appointment we were rushed to pick a color and sit down.. then my lady was talking to other employees the entire time and when I tried to engage in conversation I got '"mhm'".. just didn`t seem to care. She also didn`t even completely cover my nail with the gel polish because she was doing it so quickly - you can see it doesn`t touch the bottom of my nail beds in the pic I attached. I also asked if Lily (the owner and also a tech) could do my design because she is so talented and she said that she didn`t have time.. for a 2 minute deal. So, my lady did the design and did do a pretty nice job but didn`t pay attention to detail with the picture I showed her. Also - let me add that the only reason I went here this time was because my place is closed and I needed my nails done before thanksgiving!   I`ll end my review with saying - getting your nails done is supposed to be relaxing and you are supposed to be taken care of with friendly and welcoming vibes - this place has close to none. Don`t let $$$ get in your head and remember why it is you do what you do..."<26<11<2019<20<1<11

I`m going to miss it.  Now the things that kept it from getting a 4 or 5 star rating from me.  I won`t miss that this is one of those places that automatically give you ketchup when you get eggs but do NOT give you jelly when you get toast. Only sick, demented people put ketchup on eggs cause it is utterly gross and disgusting. There is absolutely ZERO reason to make it an automatic thing to take to a table for breakfast items. This is especially true since many more people put jelly on toast than do something as sickening as putting ketchup on eggs and they not even give you any unless you ask for it.  Their bathroom was always nasty too.<2<12<2019<10<7<41
uxNNUTWrKPYquaH6m-NcNw<8UOJ-Z1JUcwNg-KQ6MalGQ<Jqd8QeYoBxJvYxhG0Lekyg<5<0<0<1<Had the best experience here! So we came on a Saturday night and thankfully did the check in option on their site. I recommend using that option whenever coming near here in the weekend. There were so many people trying to get in it looked like a movie scene. The check in made the process painless. Without it we would have been waiting over an hour at the location.   Without seeing how overly busy they were you never would`ve guessed it. All the staff was calm and courteous. Our waitress Jen was phenomenal! She had so many tables, but managed to stay attentive to them all. She also communicated well what she was doing if she had to help someone else before you. We never felt forgotten. I was very impressed with her.  Now on to the food. It was amazing! We both had the prime rib. After biting into it I completely understood the crowd. They only have prime on the weekends. Everything we ordered was fresh and well seasoned. Even my drink was spot on. I will be back many times over.<2<12<2019<13<19<13

Pementel are unprofessional in there treatment of patients regarding their billing and follow up of services.  Before my wife was treated by them she specifically asked if we were in network with them and she was told yes. Now a month later test results are not followed through and we are being billed 142 dollars for OUT OF NETWORK charges that she specifically asked about before starting any visit. My wife called about the bill and was told by Gilbert personnel they don`t know what`s wrong call your insurance company so we did and of course Gilbert and Pementel are out of network so back to Gilbert to call and resolve the issue. You call at 1.30pm and get a answering system and to make an appointment they say they are st lunch from 12 to 1 I called at 1.30 so tried billing and of course they always answer to get a payment. I asked if they were in network the person said probably but depends on which exact insurance you have so I told her the out of network story and she promptly recited the catchall of its the patients responsibility fine print clause.  Don`t trust anything they say get it in writing. And the service is lagging. Going to also report to BBB.<5<4<2016<20<56<18
rcCuxk-z8pula51gh4rRyg<BWcV7nasqaPAcOJzdWDRxg<Lz6QUlFkVKtnzSISk0WUPw<5<0<0<0<Is it tomorrow yet, so I can go back?! Seriously, that`s how much I loved this place. Hubs and I went in tonight (Thursday) around 5:30. There wasn`t a wait, but most of the tables/booths were full already. We ended up being seated at a tiny table smack dab in the middle of the room, which was kind of annoying, but whatevs. Our server was friendly, and she made sure to check on us throughout the meal. We ordered the calamari strips, cajun fries, a pound of shrimp with trifecta seasoning/level 3 spice for me, pound of shrimp with trifecta seasoning/level 2 and king crab legs with garlic seasoning/level 3 for hubs. We opted out of wearing the plastic bibs, but I made sure to wear a black tee that I don`t wear often enough to care if it got splattered with shrimpy goodness. Just rolling down the bag in order to get to the shrimp got me messy. It was then that my OCD kicked in and I was sure that I would hate the rest of the experience. Holy crap was I wrong. Yes it takes some work to get to your food, but it is SO worth it. Tear that head off the shrimp, suck down the juice, then go to town on getting the shell off, proceed to dunk your fingers in the sauce at the bottom and get a nice coating on the shrimp and all your cares of getting messy and if anyone is staring at you go out the window. Hubs was surprised at how much I loved the meal. With the appetizers, I definitely wasn`t able to finish all my shrimp, but that just means I get to savor it again for lunch tomorrow! I immediately called my mom when we got home and told her we HAVE to take her and my dad there next time they`re on our side of town. I really wish they were coming over this weekend, so we can go back. Two very messy thumbs up!<29<8<2014<3<31<53

The food options here are pretty intense. Looking at the menu, for those that look for good halal burgers well this is your spot. Combinations look great. I tried the Atomic Burger and a side of Poutine. The burger itself was quite large, based on my biased nyc prices I would consider the value to be worth it coming around $9cad for the burger.  Taste wise is where my opinion may differ: as good as the burger looked and smelled, it didn`t quite have the meaty salty flavor one is looking for (esp if you get a burger with a legit fried cheese patty). It ultimately tasted like mush but like, good mush. The poutine was good but I`m not Canadian and my experience with this food is lacking so I wouldn`t consider my opinion valuable lol. But portion wise it was a lot and definitely kept me full.  Service was quick, about 10ish minutes. It was busy and apparently remains like this consistently which is cool. The decor is nice and spacious, lots of seating. They also have a bathroom and even a prayer room downstairs. That`s a good and unexpected addition which I`m sure some appreciate. Would I come back here? Yes to probably try another one of the burgers. The combinations are exciting and the portions are enough to stuff your face and feel satisfied. Just taking a star off for the flavor profile. Have had concoctions similar in my city with much stronger flavors.<27<11<2019<13<51<19

Maybe that has to do with the fact this is the only place in Talking Stick Casino I got something back for money I put in here ;P  All I know is that, we were all pretty happy with our buffet dinner meal.    There was quite a bit of seafood available which I enjoyed such as crab claws, shrimp, oysters, etc.  There were several types of different ethnic foods, salads, pizza, chicken, beef and my favorite part of the buffet, the desserts.  The dessert area had a gelato station, cakes, pastries, pies, parfaits and my most favorite of part of this entire buffet, the made to order Bananas Foster station.  OMG, I love Bananas Foster so this was, needless to say, very exciting for me.  The sous chef working there was so sweet, and he walked me through what he was doing during the entire preparation.  Watching him flambe the bananas with rum, sugar and cinnamon and add the sweet cream.  I wish I would have taken a video of it.  It was glorious.  And it tasted as good as I knew it would.  So yummy.    All the staff I encountered throughout the buffet were friendly and helpful.  Our server was attentive in refilling our drinks and bringing us condiments we needed.  All in all, we were pleased with the overall buffet experience we had here.<19<7<2016<11<16<25

I`ve only been to Old Sugar on weekends so I didn`t know they did private events during the week.  Food courtesy of Hot n Spicy was delicious! The chicken egg roll had vermicelli which was different and gave it a nice texture. Pad thai was also delicious with a little kick and good level of sweetness. Midwestern mouths may want to stick with a spice level of 1 out of 4. The sesame rice balls were very satisfyingly chewy!  Walker was very excited to tell us about his cider and the unique flavor combos he`s trying out. I got to try a sample of the hibiscus juniper - it`s relatively light as he said, not the strong juniper flavor of gin. The cider overall has a less pronounced apple flavor and is drier than other alcoholic ciders I`ve had.  The UW Vietnamese dance performance was a nice touch at the end. Reminded me of the many performances I saw back in college on the west coast.  Excited for more to come from TD!<28<11<2019<8<29<55
bgwdGduljladO3HMQlgMKA<KhJlc3CMbkeOjea-PfmP-g<fYCRrN3sIQnioWMzF8miIA<2<3<0<0<"I have to agree with many of the bad reviews on here.  I bought a truck from them back in July.  A $38K truck ended up being slightly over $41K bc I wasn`t purchasing the vehicle (lease) and I was foolish enough to go through.  On top of that they wanted to only give me $4000 for a 2012 CX-9...lowest trade in value for my was $9K.  After arguing for about an hour they finally met me.  But they claim they match KBB and everything else`s appraisals...NOPE! Our salesman was nice and helpful but all he kept talking about was giving him a 10 star rating on his performance review to help him get a bonus.  The only reason I bought my truck from them is bc they do have a great selection, better than most dealers around here.  But stay affirm with what u want to pay and the values u want for your trade-in.  Let them flex...not you!   All in all, car buying can be a stressful time.  Their so called '"no haggle'" pricing is nice bc they are marked at decent prices but again, stay firm...they will flex trust me.  I probably won`t b back here to buy another car but if I do I will make it clear upfront what I want and what I`m willing to pay, if they can`t do it within an hour, then on to the next one.  There`s too many dealerships in Vegas to b waiting your time not getting the price you want. Good luck!"<19<12<2015<16<8<26

Shame on me for keep giving them a second, third, and fourth chance...but today was the last time fo sho. It`s always a hit or miss with them. We are pescaterians (because we love animals so much) so we always order the same thing, Shrimp Fajitas. Super easy. 1. They always forget to pack the guac and sour cream. 2. They`ve forgotten to pack the tortillas. 3. Sometimes there`s literally only 2-3 shrimp and the rest is just bell peppers. 4. Today, there was chicken mixed in with the shrimp (traumatizing) which was the straw that broke the camel`s back for us.....  Will never order from here again. THE END.<5<8<2018<2<35<18

The first night we were there we had just arrived and went to bed. The next morning when we woke up I had a rash on my face and hives on my body. My friend opposite of me had pink eye. We called the hotel (Front Desk) to tell them and they said they would change the sheets. If it persisted then they asked for us to call back. I still had hives and a rash on my face. Called the front desk again for a room change and they said they would call me back. They never did!!! The room was HORRIBLE! The hotel AC unit was blowing out a cigarette smell into the room. I spoke to Expedia after my trip and told them of the situation. They spoke to the hotel and said they have NOTHING on record in regards to me complaining of what had happened to us (hives, rash and pink eye).   They told the Expedia representative that I refused the room change when they said they would change the room. It makes no sense of how we would turn down a room change when all of this was happening to us. I am very dissatisfied with my trip and do not recommend staying at this hotel.<1<10<2019<19<21<41

Tea samples are available, as well as a snack or two, and employees are friendly and helpful about showing you around.  I don`t drink tea nearly often enough to get the health benefits, but found a few varieties here that I was interested in. They have decorative and practical infusers, as well as kitchen supplies that are both functional and fun. It is a specialty store, and the prices are in line with that reputation. I expect they`ll get pretty busy for the holiday gift-giving season, so pop in sooner rather than later. If you`re a fan of Sheffield or Teavana, you`ll be even happier here.<24<10<2016<7<37<35

I see uses for things that aren`t always the way they were intended. Today I bought containers that I will use to organize my fridge. We also bought a fridge! We were able to purchase it with a discount offered on the app. It was a savings of $350.00. We have bought appliances at IKEA prior to this and have always been pleased.  They have some unusual succulents, which I was not expecting. I bought one that I have never seen before.  People travel hours to shop at this store. While we were buying the fridge, there was a family that had traveled 3 hours one way to plan and purchase there kitchen cupboards and counter tops.  If you haven`t been, treat yourself to a visit.

When I contacted the office requesting a new patient appointment, I was met with very friendly customer service from the woman who scheduled me an appointment on my lunch break the next day. To my surprise, the next day I saw the Doc, selected frames, and purchased my contacts in 30 minutes tops. The quality of service was impeccable within that half hour. The doctor was kind and knowledgeable and even discussed payment expectations with me. The woman who took my call remembered me. Off I went to select my frames and a woman helped me select frames within my price point and then two additional staff members helped to narrow my selection. I wasn`t expecting anyone to assist me in that process and it became very apparent to me, as other customers were coming in for their exams and to pick up their glasses, that this place was a fine tuned MACHINE.

Since he didn`t `lock` in my rate, my new rate is much higher.  My argument was that we had already discussed the details which is the reason I had agreed to the rate and thus chosen to move forward with the refi. Why would he not lock in this rate for me?  Clearly he was not looking out for my interest. Then again he wasn`t looking out for the bank`s interest either. Since they lost this deal, no closing costs earned. Perhaps it was just pure incompetence. You can be the judge. I will definitely never use this bank ever again.<6<12<2019<15<48<59

First off my father was Dr. Wall`s patient for 20 years.  He had paid her the extra fee she charged for many years for the service she provided.  My father became very ill and was in the hospital many months and my father was concerned with his health and so was the family.  My dad had questions he wanted answered and Doctor Wall was seeing my father on her rounds at 11:00PM at night on a regular basis when my father was sleeping and when the family was not at the hospital.  She did not communicate with our family well even after repeated calls to her office.  Dr. Wall just has too many patients on her plate.  I have never seen a doctor see patients that late of night at a hospital and even the nurses commented about her seeing patients that late.  Unfortunately my father passed away at an extended stay facility a few weeks after being released from the hospital and the family did not get one call from Doctor Wall or a card.  All my other fathers doctors sent us a kind note along with many nurses.  My father was one to tell jokes and he make everyone that helped him have a smile.  I would not advise having Dr. Wall as your GP.  I would like to make a strong suggestion to Doctor Wall if she reads this.  It would had been nice of you to had contacted our family after my dad passed and you should seriously think about cutting your patient load and clinic hours.  I think a doctor needs time to rest and sleep.  I felt Dr. Wall was missing both.  The body needs a certain number of hours to sleep and rest so it can have a clear mind for the next day of work.<9<4<2019<7<35<29

x9hOvxuXDSsBNrvifdxsig<JkUFfQHGxxFVbbVdhqWbsw<pd8104c6sITdZtMTboNDtg<1<11<0<1<I have a family member who lives here. When my relative moved in they were very happy because they had activities that my relative participated in and when my relative moved in, they were allowed to bring visitors to these activities. Now, in an ill-fated move by the owner, he has ruled that no guests are allowed at any events, nor are they allowed in the clubhouse, which makes it miserable for my family member to have guests as they are either bound to the apartment, or must leave the complex to enjoy time together. The owner, in his ignorance, likens this to a country club, however, country clubs have guest passes for visitors, and this owner is doing the exact opposite of what seniors need, which is keeping them isolated from friends and family. Why would you pay for an apartment that doesn`t allow you to enjoy all your time and activities with your friends and family? In addition, this complex states that they have continental breakfasts daily, however, it is usually some cheap breakfast rolls and coffee, not even juice. I have advised my relative to live out their lease and then find a senior living place that is conducive to them being able to interact in all areas and activities with their outside friends and family. This complex is esthetically nice, but the management only cares about the money, not the tenants. In your senior years, don`t rent here. Rent somewhere that you can enjoy your visitors in all areas of the community.<24<5<2019<20<33<6

I made arrangements to have someone come to clean my elderly mother`s 998 sq ft patio home.  The appointment was scheduled for 9 am.  At 9:30 because no one had arrived I called and and informed the office.  I was told that they would make a call to see what was going on. A few minutes later I received a call informing me that the girl a problem that morning and that fortunately they had someone on standby that could come and should arrive in about 10 minutes. ( she arrived at approximately 10 am and ironically her name was the same name as the original girl )  She was friendly and pleasant. I showed her around and explained what we we wanted her to focus on. I also provided her with a hand written list of the things that we wanted done. I told her that we were more than happy to have her stay beyond the original 3 hours if necessary. ( I had previously discussed this when I first made the appointment and I had even discussed the cost to have her stay additional hours )   I explained that I was not going to be able to stay for the entire time that she was there because of a doctors appointment. ( after all she arrived an hour late )  While I was there both my mother and I repeatedly told her that she was doing a great job.  We made sure that things we put away so that her job of cleaning would be a easy as possible.  I left for my appointment at 11:45.  The '" add ons'" were:  change the sheets on 2 beds, clean the top of the fridge, clean 2 ceiling fans,   vacuum the sliding glass door track in master bedroom, vacuum or dust the ceiling vent in the hall.  When I returned home from my appointment the she was gone. I walked around and discovered that other than replacing the sheets ( we had stripped the beds ourselves, and had even put the pillows in the pillow cases ) she had failed to do do any of the things on my list. Plus, basic cleaning was missed. Big strips of carpet that wasn`t vacuumed. Areas that were not dusted. The 2 mirrored wardrobes were not touched.etc. And, after 4 hours she took off! The crazy thing is my dear mother gave her a $35 tip!   I spoke to the office and they offered me a small credit for a future cleaning. I don`t think so... the reason being, I feel that they lied to me that morning. They said they had a girl on standby but were actually just trying to buy extra time.  Plus, they have their own cleaning products and I had to redo the glass tables and mirrors that she did do. They looked horrible.  I know this review is really long but... I just wish I had known all of this ahead of booking them myself."<18<11<2019<12<39<28

The person running Service was at least 10 minutes latest.  I didn`t get checked in until 9:15-9:20, although I was there at 8:45.  I get a call an hour later than I would need 4 new tires to pass inspection and that this is to be expected.  Keep in mind that my new X5 only has 2 years and 25k miles on it.  In the past, I have received a 10% coupon when I got new tires (never had I had to get them after 25k miles).  I was told this time that I was unable to get this coupon because they were giving me a free alignment with the four tires.  At every single service provider that I have ever dealt with before, I have received a free of charge alignment with a new tire purchase, so I do not think they were doing me an extraordinary favor.  As I waited 5 hours for my car to service to be completed, I overheard a current employee talking to a customer about the negatives of the ex GM and also how his personal relationships were going.  This was very unprofessional.  Let me point out that the refrigerator used for bottle waters for the customers was empty and there were no snacks like there used to be.  Maybe this ex-GM wasn`t liked because he ran a tight ship and expected the employees to actually provide high quality customer service.  If you do not mind poor customer service and pouring $1500 into your new X5 after only 25k miles then this place may be for you.  I would advise everyone to do thorough homework on BMW before purchase.  This is my third BMW and will be my last.

CsuGhTGTX5cZFtM_n827Pg<phq0dVM4OSnNFMG2bEzfTQ<w3lvOCY1MyiVLHa8JXcklg<1<0<0<0<I am the owner of a rental property in Las Vegas.  This company was sent to the property via American Home Shield (my home warranty company).  They were sent out because the tenant was complaining of a loud noise when the heater was used.  This company assessed the problem and stated that there is nothing wrong with the HVAC system and the noise is coming from the roof.  My property management company hired a roofer who evaluated the house and said that there is nothing wrong with the roof and the noise is coming from the HVAC system.  So the property management company then hired Legacy Air who assessed the situation.  It turns out that A & R (In)Complete Service failed to even locate the second heating unit in the house!  Legacy Air was dumbfounded by this and so was I.  The problem turned out to be a broken induction motor which can now be replaced.  This caused a great deal of inconvenience for me, my tenant and my property management company and it also caused me to pay out of pocket for services that I did not need (roofer, second HVAC company) and for repairs that should and would have been covered by the home warranty company if the problem had been diagnosed correctly in the first place.  This would have required only minimal effort and professionalism from the part of the technician from A & R Complete Service.  Needless to say, I will NEVER conduct business again with this company and I may rethink my home warranty company (American Home Shield) as well for sending such an incompetent and unprofessional company to service my rental property.  Please consider this review along with the many other negative reviews on this site regarding this company before you make the error of doing business with them.  Thanks for reading!<2<11<2019<1<49<31

I am pretty sure their steaks are pre-frozen, packaged and then cooked. I go to Longhorn for my steaks.<22<1<2019<1<43<59

The salesman came with no pressure to purchase, talked about other ways to help with the sun.   He suggested we go down to the office to see the product and how it is made.   We went down and the staff there was awesome.   The were very friendly, very accomodating and knowledgable.   The product was finished and installed on time.  The installers (Jaush and Dave) were on time, very professional and friendly.   When they were done, Jaush went over everything with us.   We are very pleased with the product and installation and would definately recommend them.<1<9<2014<22<7<56

After ending my relationship after 7.5 years and moving houses this past summer he also lost his best human friend. After a long, hard search for a feline friend, I introduced a new kitten buddy to our home last week. Unfortunately Tony has a UTI history so after he stopped eating/drinking yesterday, felt extra heavy/uncomfortable today and started howling tonight I thought the worst! It`s late night Monday so I chugged the rest of my wine & ordered a Lyft (don`t judge me). However, between picking up my cat carrier and purse I forgot my phone on the trunk of my car.   Upon arrival the VCA staff was extraordinary, taking extra care knowing my Tony is very skittish. They quickly reviewed his history, took the necessary steps of blood & urine samples & determined a healthcare report. In under 2 emergency/on call hours we received his workup, bill of health (including lab results for his visit) and his medicine.   While I paid for Tony`s treatment I realized I didn`t have my phone. After retracing my steps I knew I left it behind and couldn`t order a ride back. Kendra was AMAZING and went above & beyond to help me get a ride home!!! Dr. Castonguay & Michelle gave top-of-the-line service to Tony, making his visit comfortable and as smooth as possible.  Overall it was my 2nd positive experience with this location. Thank you, VCA & TEAM, for your utmost commitment to animals & humans. WE APPRECIATE YOU!!!<5<11<2019<9<0<7

I`ve been trying to call and leaving a message to get the driveway light fix and I`ve even went to the office all they gave me is the round around a supposedly maintenance will take care of it but it`s still not taking care off. '"OMG'" I`ve even offered to fix them and they told me not to touch anything and I`m still waiting. I don`t know if they are trying to ignore me, but they are really bad when it comes to maintenance.

If you have a group of 3 OR MORE, DON`T WAIT IN LINE, INSTEAD GO TO HOSTESS AND THEY WILL JOT YOUR NAME DOWN (they have a sign out front that also has this information).   Once seated inside , I could smell the cigarette smoke from the casino. This is not an enclosed restaurant and there are casino games in close proximity which allows smoke to end up in eating area.   Not going to lie, when the food came out I was sad at how bare my plate was. Everything is a la carte so our french fries came in their own container... leaving my burger all alone on a big plate. When I took off the bun, the presentation of the burger was also a little '"blehh'". Thank goodness it tasted AMAZING! Don`t judge the burger by it`s presentation!"<23<7<2019<6<8<6

dZBFWbjxubPaZK38wYgEpQ<J8W9dk3y7TBKkNSlM97kWw<XK7_B2moEchOdg8UQQc6Bg<5<0<0<0<I have grown up eating at Brixx, so I`ve always feel warm and welcome when I walk in.  The service is always fabulous, several of the waiters always make my day by simply saying hello with a smile.  I have a gluten allergy, and their gluten-free crust is pretty good!  It is a thin crust and gets charred easily, but I prefer it that way, anyway!  I always order the Chicken Florentine pizza and substitute the Roma tomatoes for caramelized onions.  Once again, I`ve never had bad service at this location before (Birkdale) and the food is delicious!  They have endless options, not just pizza.  They have good salads and (since I can`t eat it!) all of my friends like the pasta.  The place has a very large and dog-friendly patio that also encloses in the cold/rain.  The patio is also heated (Yay!).  If the place is busy, which it almost always is, it takes a little longer, up to 30 minutes, but to me, it`s worth the wait!  I`m a very picky eater, too, and this restaurant is always on the top of my list.  The place is pretty clean and the bathrooms, are typical, I guess.  But, they`re cleaner than many others I`ve suffered - er - had to walk into.  Thank you, Brixx Pizza!  (I don`t live in San Fransisco, I live in NC and have always lived here, so FYI Yelp has my location a little off!)<9<11<2019<20<0<51

Prince`s tones play as I sit here and pen this.  Will I be satisfied here! Not sure yet but the music is fantastic.  This is what it feels like when doves cry! I cannot help myself the beaconing of his vocals call to me I`m singing along so are most in the bar! Air keyboards as we get to the climax of the song!  It`s happy hour when I came in so that`s good I had what was on tap for the day. Which turns out to be Sierra Hazy IPA in a blonde. Hey the beer matches my hair awesome. The blonde of the beer enhances the taste of the hops flavor. The beers color is a burnt yellow. All in all I stuck with these through the whole visit. I believe that I`m on number three right now; at $3.00 a glass that`s a steal. Now that we have covered the alcohol hurdle let`s continue.   The atmosphere of the restaurant is themed to a beach cabana high end establishment that has amazing food and beer. In true Vegas style they hit the nail since everything about the bar is perfect. You know it`s a great run business when the bartender does not stop. She keeps taking care of us patrons and fills the drinks for the tables around the bar.   After looking over the happy hour menu and the regular menu it is time to order. I am amazed at the size sampling`s they offer here. An individual may order single size burgers and fry portions. The small cheeseburger that I ordered was delicious. It tasted like it just came from the grill in the backyard. I was so impressed when I took a bite from that little marvel. The cheeseburger melted in my mouth as I chewed that first bite. Savoring that taste it burned into my psyche forever. The burgers here whether big or small are worth the visit. Pickles are a weakness that I will break all the rules for. With that in mind pickles that are fried with ranch, yes I`ll take those too! The pickles were so much more tasty when deep fried. Paired with ranch there is a masterpiece!   The service is flawless with the employees being very friendly. The staff interfaces with one another to help one another as needed. The music is up all the way and creates a powerful presence that everyone enjoys! The weather is perfect here in Las Vegas and as the sun sets the rays of light shimmer and sparkle on the windows of the Encore. What a place to just enjoy yourself!   The bar has televisions all around the bar and the World Series game three is playing. The Dodgers will win this game and bring the glory home to L.A. The music is playing all those songs you can sing along too, the beer is cold and on tap. If cocktails are your poison then the fabulous bartender can make your drink! The food, especially the cheeseburgers will stimulate your senses! Now come celebrate with us!<27<10<2018<0<37<50

We`ve gone two Saturday`s at 8 a.m. (read: not late), and there`s been little to no selection. This last time, croissants were the only thing available, and they announced that no new donuts would be coming out any time soon. What?!

The food is excellent but the service sucks!   We were a party of 8 from out of town and went to the restaurant around 6:00 PM and were told not to occupy the booth as they had a Poker Tournament and when we decided to leave the place to go elsewhere it dawned on them that that losing a party of 8 is not a good idea so they called us and told us that '"they could accommodate us as the tournament was not on until 7:00'".   Thank you very much, much obliged.  The lady who took our order was not really interested as she missed the drinks order of half of the party and then they decide not to order any alcoholic beverage which is high margin item except I who ordered a beer and a coworker who ordered a house margarita. Too bad.   Not that things got better. It took over 15 minutes to get the drinks to arrive!!!!  The food on the other hand made up for the service. They do not offer complimentary Chips and Salsa but what ordered was fantastic. The fresh mild Pico-de-Gallo and the not so mild salsa were a perfect combination.  I ordered the Tres Tacos and I choose one Chicken, One Shrimp and One Fried Avocado (veg) and what a combination. Each had distinct flavor and the Chicken was outstanding as it was NOT the usual shredded boiled chicken with seasoning but chicken with some robust flavors.

What stood out to me back then was their spicy yummy hot and sour soup.   The atmosphere hadn`t changed from last time. Two fake trees are situated inside with lots of hanging lights imitating an outdoor feel. Above the kitchen, there are fake second floor rooms with windows that have a different light in each room. That`s a cool design!!! They also have a patio area outside.   This time I went there for lunch and got a sizzling plate of eggplant and other veggies. It came with a pyramid shape rice bowl. The dish was flavourful but it could have been spicier. Too much sauce for my liking too. At least the portion was huge. My partner had the chicken Katsu bento box and he was satisfied.   For a lunch at an Asian place, I found it was pricey. However, if you are having a celebration, they indeed have lots of space to cater to you. I would go back if they still have their happy hour menu.<18<9<2018<22<37<9

It`s never crowded and I say that because not many followers on my part and not in my area so I know it won`t be flooded with people   2.

The food I was not disappointed with my servings plates full. Unlike other places were it looked like I got the leftovers of someone else`s hash browns. The food was hot I never had to send anything back. And finally it was delicious I walked in with and excited smile and left with a gratifying pleased smile.

zZ0E5z7M46H3h97PFODuAg<niKu4se6xtf-ctlm0udr1w<-FLnsWAa4AGEW4NgE8Fqew<2<2<0<0<Had breakfast here, thought it was going to be a treat since there were all these people waiting out front and there was a 20 min wait for a table inside.  I ordered the wild mushroom omelet and my friend ordered the blt with cottage cheese since they didn`t serve sweet potato fries yet apparently.  (I wasn`t too impressed with the menu selections either btw, there was like 5 salads and 6 sandwiches for lunch, but i guess it is BREAKFAST club) The omelet wasn`t very good - I`m not sure if it was because I should`ve ordered a meat along with the mushroom or the 1/4 lb brick of cheese inside but overall it was bland and the cheese was just ridiculous even after I pulled the excess goo out.  No amount of ketchup, salsa, Tabasco or Patio could salvage it.  My friend was nice enough to trade with me halfway through and the BLT was ok, but I gotta say this even though it feels wrong - there is too much bacon.  There would be a pile of 5 strips of thick sliced bacon in each bite and whereas I do love bacon, it was a bit overpowering.  Not to mention, between each slice was a thick layer of grease which made me wonder if they cooked it in layers in the oven???  Anyways, after I pulled out all but 2 layers the balance seemed restored AND my friend got some meat for the omelet.    All in all - the service was great, the hash browns were good and I loved the strips of red and yellow peppers in it, but did not like the menu selections which were pretty limited and the entrees.  The omelet had more cheese than egg, and the BLT had more bacon than LT and bread combined.<27<2<2011<19<13<30

I chose this facility based on the experience I had at the Goodyear facility 5 years ago. We were at this facility for a little over a month when we decided to unenroll our family. Our daughter immediately got sick and spent the entire time we were there sick with assorted viral and stomach issues. At pick up she was screaming, purple in the face, snot dripping down her chin and mouth, filthy, face covered in some sort of dried on sticky substance that hadn`t been cleaned and now collected dirt. Her screaming was so intense she was hyperventilating and spent the rest of the night trying to regulate her breathing and catch her breath. She was the only child in the room while this happened and the teacher completely ignored her, standing on the opposite side of the room talking to other adults. We immediately notified management and instead of concern both individuals made excuses and defended the teacher as being '"overwhelmed'". I`m sorry but if you can`t manage to care for one child at even a bare minimum standard because you had a rough day you should not be in the childcare profession. After confronting staff about this first and very serious issue they became catty and rude like immature children. Issues that shouldn`t ever be issues developed, horrible communication skills high turnover and at the end the kids teachers were never informed that we had notified management two weeks prior that we were unenrolling so half our kids stuff was gone. We`d witnessed our sons teacher grabbing a child`s face and jerking it upward while she yelled in his face. We left quickly without caring about the kids things that were left because we never wanted to go back. Over a week after our last day I see on my statement they charged us the day we left for the next week of care and again on 11/30 for the upcoming week. I was livid, absolutely raging. Over a grand they took with no authorization. I emailed I called I left voicemails, it was Saturday so of course I knew I`d get no response. Monday morning Im literally walking out the door to go in person and deal with them when I get a call from the accounts manager questioning me as if we`d never unenrolled even though we`d been gone for over a week! Id spoken to her or someone claiming to be the accounts manager when I gave notice, I had an email from the same conversation, the director had multiple times made petty comments to us about leaving. I got an email from a corporate rep saying they`d refund the money and sorry for the inconvenience. The money was back in my account next day but it`s disappearance had already done it`s damage with utilities being shut off, bills bouncing all over the place, short rent therefore having to pay fees. They were disingenuous even in their generic and short '"sorry for the inconvenience'". How does this location function in it`s auditing? How did no one notice the extra money and apparently missing kids? Don`t bring your kids here. Children`s Learning Adventure used to be top of the line. The facility is pretty and clean but I`m here to tell you none of that matters, it`s the staff that`s important. This location also doesn`t have the security monitors it`s supposed to and when we enrolled she lied right to my face and said they were going to be working the next Tuesday but once we were enrolled she said they weren`t going to be fixing or replacing them at all. This was one of the things we told them was important to us and almost ALL childcare facilities have. They didn`t use the app anymore for student updates or communication which is ridiculous because again almost all childcare facilities also use it, especially those charging so much! They paid no attention to check ins and check outs, they buzzed everyone in without paying attention to who it was. We move a lot so we have had a lot of experience with different childcare facilities and never once had this many issues. I`m willing to pay high prices for good care but this location hides behind the fancy facade and supplies subpar care with underqualified teachers."<5<12<2018<14<45<32

The steamed gyoza is top notch with flavor and freshness. We actually ordered two orders of it because it was so delicious!! The three kinds of mushrooms with butter appetizer lays on top of a bed of greens for a type of small salad and is flavored perfectly. On to the ramens: we got the Classic and the Blaze. The classic we added broccolini and it was truly spectacular. I might omit the black garlic oil for just regular garlic next time but that is a personal decision. The Blaze was perfectly spicy - on a scale of 1-10, it would be a 6. Not overwhelmingly spicy we added butter and black garlic oil to the Blaze. Definitely give this new restaurant a shot!

The staff was extremely helpful and they got me in and out quite quickly.  that, however, is where the good experience stopped.   Since installing my new Contour boxes...I have had nothing but issues. Not only did I have to take half a day off from work to have them installed, they have not worked right since that time. I have to repeatedly reset my box to make it work. Finally over The weekend, I called and I had Cox do the reset.  The box started working again. I then went to tune into my MLB package that I subscribed to, it would not work. When I called Cox, they told me that since I got new  boxes it would not work and they would have to fix that. Why the technician would not know that, I`m not very sure. They were able to get the MLB package working after about 25 minutes, but they were quite clear that they had to resubscribe me and that my billing would probably be wrong and to watch for it and call back if and when I saw it was wrong.  Here we are two days later. Box not working again. I called Cox and they can automatically detect that I`ve already called for something today so I get placed through to a person. Again in defense of the individual, she was extremely nice. Unfortunately after 30 minutes on the phone we could not get the boxes going.

It all seems old and not worth the prices they are charging for many items.  (Um, you can buy new kids/toddler clothes in Walmart for $3.  Why would you pay $2 for something old and not nice looking?)  It seems like they need a stricter criteria for what is re-sellable, and how to price items.  Salvation Army or Savers is much better for used clothing, in my opinion.    But the furniture is worth a visit.  Or 20 visits.  I have dropped in here three times now.  The reason is that every time I go in here, I see some pieces and think, '"That is soooo cool!'" and then see '"Sold to ____'" on the tag.  And then I am really sad.  Once I actually took a picture of furniture that was already sold to some lucky person.  It was just that cool.  I am a furniture restoration/upcycle nerd.  The really awesome thing here is they have new inventory of furniture all the time, and it moves quickly!  You don`t come in a month later and see the same ugly old end table from 1980, like some thrift stores in town.  Every time you are here, you see people bringing furniture in and carrying furniture out.  I picked up a small desk for my child for only $15!  (Which I planned to paint because it looked beat up, but a little Murphy`s Oil Soap, and voile, it didn`t need any paint!)  It is hit or miss but has a good enough inventory to visit often, looking for a '"hit.'"      The household items are somewhat junky, but you might find something good here.  I got some cute ice cream dishes, like old fashioned soda shop style, for $1 each.    I had no problems with the people working here.  They all were pleasant to me."<14<5<2013<6<59<27

They have a nice selection of really delicious burgers including prime burgers. We came to this restaurant on two visits the first time we ate in and our waitress was Lily and she was amazing and very attentive. We had the double bacon burgers which come with skinny fries. The burger was delicious the fries were OK.   The second time we got takeout and I got the prime burger with fries. Getting takeout was quite a long wait of at least 30 minutes which surprised me. Inside service is much quicker. The cashier was Cecelia and she was a bit rude. We also got the classic chocolate milkshake which was delicious. If you go here I would recommend going inside is you`ll get more friendly service versus getting take out. The burgers were on spot but fries could use some work.<1<8<2019<17<42<53

When I pulled up to the address I noticed the line out of the door and the parking lot was full. Thankfully, I ended up finding a park on the street less than one block away.   I was greeted by a smiling hostess who informed me that the wait would be about 40 minutes (and I was okay with that). After about 40 minutes I was seated in a booth and my server '"Tiny Dancer'" (her name on my receipt) came over immediately. She had a huge smile on her face that made me want to hug her and say '"Hey Girl Hey!'" And she was on point...didn`t miss a beat.   Initially, I wanted to order the pancake flight but I knew I wouldn`t be able to eat all three pancakes by myself. So I went with the OMG French Toast, Scrambled Egg, Chicken Sausage, Hash Browns & a caramel latte.  Everything....Everything was fantastic! But before my order came out, a Frosted Sticky Bun pancake was brought to my table '"compliments from my server'". Then while I was eating this heavenly tasting pancake (taste like it was made by The Creator Himself) a gentleman walked up, and kneeled down to verify everything was tasting divine (I`m still wondering if he was the owner or a manager). I could tell he had a passion for Snooze, he seemed invested and determined to make sure every customer was 100% satisfied.   I didn`t want to leave, it was such a pleasant experience that I left a 100% tip with a little note saying everything was perfect. Snooze has me considering making Houston my new home. Totally worth the 40 minute wait on a beautiful Friday afternoon. So glad I ventured out on my own while visiting Houston."<28<3<2017<1<50<44

The food is very fresh and you can definitely tell the difference compared to other breakfast establishments. There`s a bar but don`t count on it being fully stocked.

The French toast sauce (some mix of salted caramel, vanilla cream and mascarpone cheese) was phenomenal. It tasted like warmed condense milk and I refused to let our waitress remove my plate before I licked every last drop. The Brioche was buttery and fluffy and was a good match for the delicious sauce. I only wished they would have dipped the bread in the sauce for longer so the middle can soak up more of the sauce as it was a bit bland.   Ham Benedict III was amazing as well. Snooze is not kidding when their menu describes a '"perfectly poached egg'" under the description because the egg was indeed poached to perfection. When you cut your fork through the layer of hollandaise, egg, ham and English muffin, the egg yolk oozes out and spills down your tower of Benedict goodness. Perrrrrfect. I wasn`t so big on the hash brown patty/cake that came along, but it was still decent.  Service was good and there was no wait since we came on a weekday; however expect a 1-1.5hr wait especially on the weekend.

Superica is def popular and the wait times can be a little long on the weekends but it is worth the wait! Atmosphere is always lively and it can get pretty loud due to large groups dining.

The chips and salsa is always fresh! The green salsa is my go to and I can put the green salsa on everything I order its so good.  My favorite entree to order is the Steak, Chicken and Shrimp fajitas. A very large portion, comes with this amazing melted butter you can pour over the fajitas, tortillas and a side of beans.  For Brunch I get order the Steak and eggs, it is similar to the fajitas but has a fried egg over the steak and peppers. The pancakes are amazing as well.

However, this location should take a few pointers from Roncey. I arrived at 7pm on a Saturday to a less than half full restaurant. Upon entry, we were advised that if we wanted a table, we would have an hour to eat as there was a reservation, which we declined (who can eat and have a bottle of wine in an hour without being rushed). He then advised us that a table had just sat and we could wait an hour an a half until they left. There was never an apology or explanation as to why we could sit at a table when more than half the restaurant was empty. I would like to add that the bar was suggested as an option but no one was in the restaurant and we did not want to sit awkwardly at the bar. Management should learn a few things in customer service. I will not return to any Defina restaurant after this experience.<11<11<2018<2<5<47

I stood in line waiting for a table for 4 adults and a child, while the rest of my group was gambling or walking around since there was no reason for everyone to stand around doing nothing. Well, a group 5 behind me got seated because they were all there in line, they even got to pass up a number of other people in line that had 1, 2 or 3 in their party. I get it that they want to maximize seating since it`s so busy but if you would have told me, I would`ve had everyone there in less than 5 minutes. And to top it off, multiple hostesses came by multiple times asking everyone how many were in the party, and wrote it down each time. Not sure what that was about, did they think it changed since you asked me two minutes ago?!? All in all, the food is great, the service is great once you are seated but if you decide to come during dinner, be prepared to wait and be passed up by others even if you are by yourself. Actually, I would recommend coming during the day (not lunchtime) to avoid wait.<4<12<2019<4<14<51

We went to a Sunday morning warm flow class for all levels and we really liked it. The instructor, Robert, was very kind, and helpful. He often times would do many of the moves near us so that we could follow along, and even helped our form a few times. We appreciated how welcoming he was! The studio was very nice and inviting. The lights were off, quiet music was playing and candles were lit. I LOVED that this wasn`t '"hot'" yoga, but it was slightly warmer than room temperature, which helped us get a good sweat on. Even though we really didn`t know all of the moves and positions, we were able to catch on and didn`t feel too out of place. At the end of the class I did ask Robert if there was more of a beginners class so we could learn the poses, and he informed us of a yoga 101 workshop that they offer once a month, so my boyfriend and I both signed up!   I give it 4 stars because the gentleman working the computer at the front desk was not that kind or welcoming. He sort of let off a vibe as if we shouldn`t be coming to this studio if we`ve never done yoga before. We`ve all tried something new before where we feel out of place, and he made us feel that way for sure. Definitely not pleased with his rude attitude, but overall our experience at the studio and with the instructor was great! We will be back and hopefully will have other instructors as friendly as Robert!"<21<1<2019<17<15<38

There was also a lot of great places to photograph and be photographed. The building held a massive studio with different artists showcasing their pieces with pop-up galleries selling pieces as well. Did I mention the food trucks?! It was a bit crowded and lines were long, so it`s probably better to get food and drink early on in the evening.<5<10<2019<19<58<22

So we put on some clothes (barely any, shorts and bikini top for me), and cozied up to the bar for some much needed water and food to counteract all the booze and sun. We started w the Pretzel Fondue which was served w a sterno to keep the cheese perfectly warm for prolonged dipping - A+  I got the Sweet Corn Ravioli which was so awesome! OMG it was the perfect lunch for a day at the pool - beautifully served and with perfectly paired flavors!  My mate got the Crispy Shrimp Caesar Salad which he really enjoyed (I can`t eat shrimp so I can`t vouch), he said it '"exceeded expectations'" (he`s not very good at this Lol).

My wife and I usually went there for the robatayaki, the grilled items, but apparently the ramen was such a big seller, they`ve farmed it out into its own restaurant. The portions here are generous; the noodles firm, the soup rich in taste. I miss the spicy miso ramen featured at other places, but, small oversight. We recently tried the '"hot rock'" appetizer, which is a deep fried shiitake mushroom stuffed with crab salad and sriracha sauce, that was pretty tasty, although opening night blues served it up slightly cold instead of hot. We also tried a geso kara age, fried squid tentacles -- the coating on these was light and crisp, although it`d be better if the geso were split up from their cluster to make it easier to pick up and eat. The accompanying mustard and lemon mayo was quite delicious. This is a welcome addition to the growing list of ramen spots in the East Valley and look forward to our next visit!"<9<5<2017<2<28<17

The lobster spaghetti is the staple to order for the table while the steaks and other meats are as delicious as they come. However we also ordered daily specials.   The service is also top notch. They make great suggestions and simply seem to love what they do.  What`s great about this place is that you can go all out and spend a week`s pay or dine for a very reasonable price based on what you choose.

One thing I noticed that changed was the reduced amount of seasoning/ingredients in the spicy broth.  We usually come for lunch since my boyfriend literally only eats lamb (he gets like 5 plates) and some veggies. If you only care for the lamb/beef/pork then lunch is a great option since dinner is way pricier and a waste if you don`t eat much from the buffet bar.

I don`t think anyone here answers the telephone... ever. I waited on hold until the phone system ended the call - yep, the service centre call automation ended the call, I didn`t hang-up.  It wasn`t too long, perhaps 5 minutes for each call attempt (but I attempted to reach someone several times). It was only after I was connected to a person at another Dewalt Service Centre that I clued into my experience being a common thing.

Monthly locked in price, no more no less. Internet service is very consistent and when you need customer service, they are available at your service. The installation itself is perfect. Our dish stands high of our roof against the wind, the rain and extreme sunshine. The most important part of all is the quality of the internet service. We have been with them for more than a year now and the number of internet was downs was zero. They billed your credit card and no phonecalls to upsell is ever. We have tried  century, dish, and many more cable services for internet service and all failed to satisfy us as customers. I`m very happy of Yelp because through this app is how I found LV.NET.

We also ate for about an hour.  There is hardly any parking so you may need to park in the street or across the street in the lot if you get there and the parking lot is already full. Lots of space outside for people to sit around and wait and you can get drinks while you`re waiting outside too.    I tried the pancake platter with a couple of different kinds. The one with the strawberries were the best as well as the pineapple upside down.  The chocolate is also verrrrry good but kind of sweet or thick for me.  Hashbrowns were pretty average and the sausage that my friend ordered (I tried some) was meh.  The bacon was very crispy though and good.   Overall, the food was great but not great enough to wait over an hour.  I`d come again but only if I anticipated that my wait was less than hour based on the time I was going, and ready to come for longer conversation with friends.

Op3FEcovdtIDQUvAUenP6A<Z8AL_JyIUZE9QYjm-eLXHw<_M-jfz2X_QFr2VwKSvbhxQ<5<1<0<2<I purchased a 2014 Mini Paceman S from a smal local dealer in San Diego. I flew out to pick it up and drive it back home to Kansas City. Two hours into my evening drive, my check engine light came on. I immediately called Mini of Las Vegas (nearest Mini dealership to me) and made an 8am appt for the next day.  I couldn`t have made a better choice.  I was lucky to have been paired up with Mike McBride (Technician) and Kevin  Murray (Service Coordinator). They quickly diagnosed my turbo was failing and needed replaced. They spent so much time explaining the pros and cons of Mini vs. aftermarket parts and how the turbo actually works. They did a full inspection on the car, rotated the tires, aligned the vehicle, fixed a leak and replaced the oil filter gasket housing and changed my turbo in ONE DAY.  Not only that but they offered me a ride to my hotel or a loaner car while I was in town and made sure I had all the details I needed to file a claim with my extended warranty company.  Because this all happened when my extended warranty company was closed, I paid for the repairs out of pocket. First thing Monday, when they were back open, Mike and Kevin were on the phone starting a claim for me and fighting on my behalf. They did that AFTER they had already been paid... but they wanted me to get my money back and are still actively involved in completing this process for me. I have been to many shops, many dealerships and worked with many different service professionals. I have NEVER had an experience like this. As a woman traveling more than 28 hours alone in a car I just purchased, I just can`t tell you what it meant to have two people invested in making sure I had a car that was fixed and fixed right. Mike even stayed late to ensure there we no leaks after the repairs and drove it for more than 20 minutes to ensure there weren`t any lingering issues. He even offered his cell phone number if I woke up the next morning and there were any issues... he would open the shop and come in on his day off when the dealership was closed. I mean who does that??? I don`t live in Las Vegas but if I did, I wouldn`t take my car to anyone else. I cannot say enough about these two guys and what they did for me. If Mini is listening... they two deserve recognition and a raise.<2<8<2019<21<59<26

I went into a contract with UWD to replace the windows and doors in my parents house. They set the date of installation in the winter, of which I was wary, but figured they know what they`re doing. It was supposed to take one day, and it took three which was only the first issue.   The workers came in on a Friday and only worked for a few hours and left, saying they needed something or another. When they came in the second day, they did the same thing, worked for a little bit then said they`re come back. Mind you, this is the height of winter and every time they come, the cool down the house to pretty low temperatures and my fathers 90 year old mother was living with my parents at the time. After the second day, I called and pleaded with them to just come in and finish, and not on a day the windchill got below 0, I was worried about my grandma and my parents who are at retirement age themselves. Thankfully, it only took one more day to finish for them, though they needed to come out a separate day to fix the front door installation because it was letting snow in, yet another mistake.   Throughout this, I started calling the local office and trying to talk to the manager. At first, he apologized, wanted to meet for dinner to smooth things over, and promised everything would be fixed. After a while, he quit returning my calls. I had been civil the whole time, despite being incredibly frustrated. There`s no excuse for the manager and company as a whole to stop returning my calls and essentially refuse to talk to me, especially when they made such big mistakes with my contract.   Now the last thing I`ll add is that my grandmother passed shortly after. Now I won`t go so far as to accuse them of anything, but I can`t help but think that the unnecessary extra days they opened the house up to the extreme elements played a role because she was doing well prior to this. She was oxygen bound and rarely left the house anymore, and we told them this before they started. What it boils down to is that they promised one day installation and that they knew what they were doing, but could not deliver anything that they promised and won`t even call me back to talk about it.<31<5<2019<11<7<29

Then we finished the bread and asked us if we wanted more and we said yes.  So we got charged $6 total. I just thought that they didn`t want to waste the bread and just assume we wanted some. View was beautiful.  Our server wasn`t the greatest but the food was good and the desserts were excellent. We had the steak tartare which was quite good. Very flavorful. They had a salmon that was on special was which excellent and highly recommend. We ended up sharing 3 desserts: Dark Chocolate Ganache, Coconut Cream Pie and the Lemon Crémeux.  Excellent!<4<12<2019<20<57<42

The tray we got was fresh, we enjoyed every piece. It`s terrific for the price - we had 3 people eating the 60pcs tray. We were also very full! We liked how Haru had an option for a group of 3. Most places I`ve been usually have sets for 2, which then we need to order another salad/soup.   Their service was more than perfect!!! They`re super welcoming, and fun fact: they`re Korean! They always made sure you had enough tea throughout the meal & checked up on us every now and then.   It was sweet that they gave us ice cream at the end. The flavours are: mango, green tea, & red bean.   We very much enjoyed our dinner here, and will come again!<8<12<2019<5<11<35

Second, the carne asada tacos my spouse and I ordered were just okay. The meat was a little tough and lacked flavor. I had high hopes for Habanero`s.

I wanted to LOOK at the Rav4 when I went to the dealership.  As soon as we pulled up and parked, Roxanne greeted us with a big friendly smile.  Not a '"salesperson'" smile but a friendly '"person'" smile.   She was extremely patience going back and forward for different keys so I could just look inside each car.  Finally, I was impressed enough to test drive one.  No pressure at all from Roxanne.  She answered all of my questions and addressed all of my concerns in a very professional manner.  She was there to the end when we drove off in my new vehicle.   I truly recommend her if you are ever looking for a car!"<14<5<2018<22<29<3

7yrvWNnxjLS49oSv1A5sgg<EiP1OFgs-XGcKZux0OKWIA<n84zloJr2-4OXmOGS7mG6A<4<3<1<2<"TLDR verision - Good restaurant for families and friends gathering.  Most dishes are in shareable portion.  Curries are the best, followed by pad thai.  Reasonably priced.  I have visited Chiang Rai 4 times by now.  In my humble opinion, Chiang Rai is the best Thai restaurant in Markham in the mid-range price range.  My favourite items are the Malay Curry, Red Curry, Tom Yum Pad Thai, Thai Basil Fried Fries, and Sweet Potato Fritter.  All taste rich, bold and are saturated with layers of flavours.  Tom Yum Pad Thai is the spiciest among the noodle dishes.  Chiang Rai`s take on Malay Curry is different from, and in my opinion better than, the version offered in many Malaysian restaurants, authenticity be damned.  All spicy dishes come in medium level of spiciness unless otherwise requested.  The fritter is sufficiently crispy, crunchy, and is a bigger appetizer than Crispy Fish and Crispy Chicken.  By the way, the '"Sriracha'" sauces in the Crispy Fish and Crispy Chicken appetizers are more of a mayo than a red chili sauce.  The Pineapple Fried Rice is on par with other places, but I would choose the Thai Basil Fried Rice over it.   All the noodle, rice and curry dishes are well portioned, so it is ideal for communal style dining.  Bring some friends and families to share the food and the bill, and it will be a tasty and affordable dinner gathering.  There is a big TV in the front.  Chiang Rai can be your sport game eatery, too.  Chiang Rai has limited offering beyond curry, noodle and rice dishes.  At this price range, I suppose this is their strategy.  Chiang Rai aims to be an eatery, not a full range, highly priced restaurant.    Last but not least, services is friendly and professional.  Food arrives sufficiently prompt during weekday lunch rushes and on weekends.  It can get really slow during a busy weekday evening."<7<12<2019<5<39<44
CKWHvnpxqJaeb4E604kFxA<KiwvYxl4NPyxo-hptrjZCQ<4_QptQBr500iB7J1-9-pFw<5<7<0<4<"These guys are top-notch. I know no things about watches. I`ve only had one in my life. I cherish it. When its sad and doesn`t work, I grow gravely concerned due to the toxic combination of my watch-ignorance and my watch-love.   So, when my watch fell behind and then stopped ticking recently, I instantly assumed the worst and went to these guys for help Monday morning. After scampering in and nonsensically babbling for 5 minutes about my own baseless theories as to why my watch wasn`t working, the man behind the counter, rather than laughing at my blatantly incorrect analysis, just very calmly and very politely suggested, '"Perhaps it needs a new battery?'"  What a wonderful thing. I laid all my cards out on the table and clearly displayed that I knew nothing. Rather than capitalizing on my naiveté and charging me for a service I didn`t need, he was a genuine and good-hearted guy. It`s moments like these that reignite your faith in humanity.   Anyways, so yeah, only spent 15$ on a battery. Also picked up a new band which I like a lot more than my old one. On top of that, the whole time, both the man behind the counter and the woman by the computer were really welcoming and enthusiastic conversationalists. Felt like I was just visiting some family friends.  Lastly, the last time I got my watch fixed, the watch guy (at some other repair shop in phoenix) left a speck of dust inside the watch face. All day everyday, that speck of dust would searingly mock and taunt me. The mental energy I wasted being annoyed at that speck of dust is too great to articulate here. When I walked into Gemtime though, I was too concerned about the overall health of my watch to remember to warn about lingering specks of dust. However, I didn`t need to. No specks of dust were left inside the watch face. Just a beautiful, shiny, healthy watch smiling back at me.   All in all, great experience. I am never trusting anyone else with my watch."<11<12<2018<22<4<20
2kjqdpfEvFOVakxcHWqv8A<-YV1yESQXqR3vpIgBjKDsw<Xcl1C4RLUlhFbzxVoIjJow<2<3<1<0<"Facilities/Amenities: 4/5 - Theater room, pool/hot tub, computers and printers, leasing package pickup (I heard there`s supposed to be an amazon locker but as of now there is none), controlled access building, lots of parking ($40 per month).  Terribly slow internet.  Area: 2/5 - DANGEROUS! Duh, you`re on Maryland, it`s going to be sketch. Only giving it a 2 because there`s an Albertsons and Target less than a block away, bunch of food options, Walgreens, etc. Very aggressive homeless people everywhere. Construction is RAMPANT. Just not a fun place to drive or walk. There`s going to be a lot of noise pretty much any side you live on with construction or pool noise.  Staff: ?/5 - Now this is really really tough for me. All of the staff are very young and obviously don`t have experience. Some of the staff members DO mean well and are trying their best. Some of the staff members frankly don`t give two shits about your concerns.    One of my biggest issues with the staff so far has been their negligence. I moved in on July 12th, was supposed to be on the 9th, but flight cancellations happened.  Upon arriving I was told no mail can be delivered as it hasn`t been set up yet with USPS. Whaaat? How are people living here?! Where does the mail go?  Finally on the 26th mail finally was finished - TWO weeks after I moved in.  My internet hasn`t been set up yet because the property manager did not send my email address to Cox for them to give me access. I was supposed to move in 3 days ago, why the hell wasn`t it set up already?!  4 full days went by where I had no internet access at all and there was nothing I could do about it.    THE BIGGEST ISSUE:  I got locked out of the building after I walked to Target and back for a few essentials. My keyfob didn`t work on any exterior doors - I tried every.single.one. In 110 degree heat carrying two heavy bags.  I banged on the office door about 10 minutes past their closing time and thank god someone was in there.  Come to find out my keyfob was only coded for 24 hour access starting on the 9th - my original move in date. Ok what the fuuuuck? Why was it ever coded for 24 hours point blank PERIOD? All I got was a '"haha whoops, sorry!'" From the property manager about it and sent on my way. A few days later it stopped working AGAIN. They fixed it again but my god I am still paranoid to leave the building after closing hours. As of 9/12 the exterior doors STILL don`t all work and if you walk anywhere you will probably be locked out.  Apartment Unit: 3.75/5 - Apartments are brand new and never lived in, however, you can really tell the construction people didn`t clean up any of their messes and left drywall chunks? Dirt, mysterious liquid drippings were dried to the floor, the bathtubs are all filthy and the brand new flooring is covered in scrapes and scratches.  However, appliances are all nice except the washer has an agitator so if you have delicate clothing you`re better off hand washing.  Ice machine in the freezer is great, large smart TV provided. I`ve got the D1 4 bedroom floor plan and it`s very spacious at just under 1500 square feet. Everyone`s got their own bedroom and bathroom. Mattress is a total waterproof dorm mattress so you`re going to need a serious pillow top. No ceiling fans in the bedrooms! Closet space/drawer space is lacking, you`ll need some additional storage.  Internet is crippingly slow - 10 down/ 10 up and you`re NOT allowed to get your own internet service.  If you`re a gamer, have video heavy lectures online, or work from home it probably won`t work for you.   Fake promises / staff miscommunication: I`m going to very honest. I`ve rented from some awesome places before and the impression I get from the Degree is they will do anything for you to get you to sign. After that it`s all up to you to verify what they told you and get what you were promised.    I was told I would receive a $500 visa gift card at move in instead of having my rent lowered from $735 to $699 - as that is approximately the annual difference between the rate.  I said cool awesome sounds great. No admin, application, or security deposit fees if I moved in earlier than August 22nd. Also cool! No fees, love that. I signed some lease addendums verifying my incentives and I did notice it said for the gift card 30 days after move in. I thought nothing of it. Why would I question the paid professional leasing agent?  At this point I haven`t had any reason to question them.  I still haven`t gotten the gift card to '"lower my rent'" and it`s the middle of September.  The homeless people are a huge issue. My roommate and I have had to call the police once already because we found a door propped open with a grocery cart. Police let us know they get calls about intruders here all the time. Homeless people sleep in the parking garage that people pay $40/month for.   Hopefully things get better."<12<9<2019<21<20<55

There were 8 of us so we got to try everything. 95% of what we tried was very good, 5% not at all. Everything there is made from scratch, you can see the kitchen out in the open and you can taste that in the quality of the food. Crispy Brussels Sprouts - good, Heirloom Tomato and Burrata Carpaccio - excellent, Grilled Peach and Mascarpone Dip - the only hiccup of the night, not good at all, Sweet Corn and White Bean Chowder Soup - good. For main courses: 4 cheese bianco - I am not a good judge of pizza as I don`t eat it but my niece said it was good, my son had a burger - he said it was excellent, very big portion, fried chicken - this portion is absolutely huge and my brother devoured it, he said it was excellent (I didn`t try it personally), barramundi (from their specials menu) - very good, walleye - excellent, grilled prime sirloin - excellent, definitely a great value at $23. For dessert - their house made donuts holes and flourless chocolate torte - both excellent. At the end of the night, the owner (Israel) stopped by our table, asked us for the feedback, when we mentioned our experience with the dip (see above), they promptly removed it from the bill. Our server (and I apologize I don`t remember the name) - was excellent, very friendly and attentive. So why 4 stars and not 5? The noise level was very loud (we came on Friday night), at some points we didn`t hear each other and since restaurant was very busy our server was trying to be in too many places at the same time. But, great experience overall, great value for the money and my daughter even mentioned that she will consider this restaurant for her birthday with her friends (they have semi-private room in the back that wouldn`t be as loud so could work out perfectly)<7<12<2019<19<57<20
dEryGhV_BY7-GGCZsHzaKg<9UJAhpO2bnFmaPkXGQEPNw<g8OnV26ywJlZpezdBnOWUQ<1<0<0<0<I recently had a horrible experience here. We came on a day that wasn`t busy at all and it took a while for us to even be seated. At first everything was fine. A table of 2 couples were seated after us. Everyone else got their drinks first. I had my 2 year old and still wasn`t served drinks. We finally put our order in of a kids pancake a kids French toast and a Mexican plate. Meanwhile the other 2 tables ordered those fancy plates that I`m sure take much longer. The table that got there after us were served first. The waiter not once came and gave us a food update we had to go to him to ask where our food was. By then my daughter was extremely hungry we had been waiting over 45 mins. While everyone else was eating and enjoying their lunch. Since my daughter was so fussy we had to rush to get out of there. I don`t like to play the racism card but I definitely felt discriminated because we were Hispanic. Everyone else was white there and got there after us and they got served their drinks and food before us. So sad that this would happen but I guess I won`t be the first or last. I will never go back to that establishment I rather take my money elsewhere. It was horrible and I wouldn`t recommend it.<25<10<2019<22<10<0

I messaged the salon asking about an appointment (not expecting to get in that day) and they got me in 3 hours later with Sharon. I didn`t really know what to expect, but I was really impressed. I was offered coffee/tea/water when I checked in and the whole salon had a really cool vibe to it. Sharon came to get me and addressed all of my hair concerns on the consultation. She also gave me what might have been the best hair wash of my life. She trimmed my hair, put in layers, and thinned it out. I was also impressed she didn`t just use thinning scissors, she actually used a technique that one of my favorite hairdressers told me about that you do with the scissors chopping parallel at the ends. I`m doing a horrible job at describing it, but basically it`s the '"professional'" way to thin hair as the thinning scissors aren`t great.   I never asked about the cost, mainly because I really needed a haircut and it didn`t matter to me at that point, but it was lower than I expected it to be for the expertise I received. I will definitely be back, especially since they are open on Saturdays."<29<7<2019<13<53<56

My biggest gripe: I`ve been a customer for years, have literally spent tens of thousands with this company over the years. The equipment is awesome, the customer service is NON-EXISTENT. I`ve spent over an hour on hold waiting to talk to someone. Ran out of time, called again in the afternoon. After 35 minutes on hold I hung up. I then created a customer service ticket, emailed support, and even opened a support chat session... same story.. waited an waited for an agent, then the chat interface timed out after 30 minutes. I bought a $4k nocturnal camera and NVR kit. Only received a partial shipment - order was placed a month ago. All I wanted was a status update. But because of the lack of service/ support - I will never do business with this company again. Unfortunately I`ll be forced into filing a dispute with my credit card company. Unreal. It really is a shame.  Just run a Google search on Lorex customer service. Across many sites, it`s one star. All the same complaint.. '"terrible customer service'". I can`t imagine how the management and officers at this company see these poor reviews and are unwilling to make adjustments to satisfy their customer base. Absolutely unreal."<8<10<2019<0<30<15

d_Vqxyw2VDBJTSYQEPV-yw<2YL4aMX2-zSyI3jasPc8bQ<ThNGovQZjZ5mn-ZwX_N2BQ<3<0<0<0<I stayed at the Linq for some work meetings and then for a mini-vacation after. So- for work meetings- I do not recommend.  We were in a smaller room that didn`t give us much space, and then a band started practicing next door at about 1, followed by a concert directly under us at 3.  We could barely hear ourselves think, and we really did have a lot to go over.  I was told by the secretary of our organization that they would probably not be using the Linq for meetings again because of this, and the spotty wifi as well.  As for the actual stay- it`s not a bad place.  The price isn`t too bad, and the charge to upgrade to a suite (we didn`t take it) is quite reasonable- $40 more a night.  If we had been staying a few days instead of 5, I probably would have jumped at it.  The beds are comfortable, and once you get used to the layout of the place and where the rooms are, it`s pretty easy to get around.  The location is quite convenient, and I loved the promenade with the shops and restaurants.  It will be even better when they get the parking construction done and less confusing.  If I had actually needed to work on my computer, I would have been SOL- the desk space in the room isn`t much- but it wasn`t a major issue.    My biggest complaint- the Wyndham hotel people on the main floor.  They will not leave you alone and do everything they can to pull you over and convince you to go tour their hotel.  One or two times was ok, but every time I passed through there, they pounced.  It got quite irritating to the point where I had to start being rude.   The room keys were really touchy in the elevators and we had to go to the front desk 3 times before they would work in the parking garage.    Overall, if I come to Vegas again, I`ll probably choose another place.<2<11<2019<14<3<58

It was crowded on a Thursday night, our wait time was about 20 min or so. We decided to hang out by the bar and ordered a beer. I`m not sure which pitcher they ordered since I came back from the restroom and was told that I had a glass to drink. It was smooth and enjoyable (that says a lot because I don`t like beer too much).  Once we got seated I was overwhelmed with the menu. I couldn`t decide what to order there were so many choices. I ordered the Salmon Sandwich (I don`t know the exact name) because I was told it was really good and it was one of the popular choices. I thought it was just ok, I don`t think I would order it again if I came back. After dinner we kept ordering shots. Pickle Backs, Chocolate Cake shot and Scooby Snacks. I guess it started with me asking if anyone has tried pickle backs and it all went downhill from there. Lets just say I`m glad I picked the later flight the next morning.   I definitely want to check this place out again when I`m in town.<7<2<2018<22<50<14

If one of the other luxury theaters is sold out or does not have a movie I want to see, this is my fall-back.  However, I really do thing the staff needs to audit the audience seating during previews or 10 minutes into the movie. Every time I go, there is always a couple or two that screen hopped and are sitting in somebody else`s seats.  They play dumb like, '"oops, we are in the wrong seats'". They move and somebody else comes up to claim their seats. Rinse and repeat. This is so distracting.   Don`t get me wrong, when I was a kid I would screen-hop the entire day at a multiplex but I always went for the front row.  I feel there needs to be more seat assignment enforcement when I am paying for reserved seating."<19<2<2019<1<21<40

We decided to go with the indoor seating and were brought to what was essentially a sunroom with lots of natural light and a great view. The inside of Washington Place was also a lot bigger than it seemed from the outside which was really nice!  As for the food, I have been here for happy hour and know that the drinks are pretty great. For brunch, we got the blueberry lemon pancakes (which tasted good but pancakes are not usually my thing), braised pot roast, and bananas foster french toast. All of those were delicious and super filling (we were full and had leftovers) even though the plates didn`t even seem that large.  Also--nice touch but they start with complimentary salted caramel monkey bread!<5<11<2019<4<5<3

At Desert Hand on Cave Creek I was told that all the therapist were CHT`s but I was assigned to one who was not. Her evaluation was totally lacking. She really didn`t demonstrate knowledge  of a proper evaluation and really didn`t even look at my situation. My shoulders and elbows were involved and she didn`t consider them. I looked around me and I noticed the other patients performing similar activities.Though I was there for a limited time, the patients that were there were all performing similar exercises. When I was a young clinician we used to call this kind of therapy shake and bake. I felt badly for those other patients who expect to be getting good treatment. I`m sure some people get adequate care but my concerns were not addressed. Possibly the other clinicians are more capable.<6<8<2019<10<14<29

We went to our previous room to go get out stuff and our key didn`t work. We went to the front desk and they GAVE AWAY OUR ROOM WITH OUR STUFF IN IT. Luckily the people that were assigned our room were good people and didn`t steal anything. The room we upgraded to in the tower is nicer but still not $250 a night nice. They didn`t do anything complementary with this whole issue so they didn`t really do anything to make it right.   West wing area they difference is huge. Plastic cups and a open bathroom no privacy at all. Horrible lighting and there is literally enough space to just fit the bed. The tower area is a bit nicer glass cups, bathroom with a door,better lighting. The beds are so uncomfortable and the pillows are very hard, sheets are rough and cheap.

For our mains we ordered the sweet potato, sage gnocchi and pile of vegetables (which was a roasted acorn squash with a variety of vegetables sprinkled with cashews and a ginger miso glaze). Both mains were full of flavour and cooked perfectly. To add, their wine menu offers a variety of wines from Ontario. It was also nice getting to know one of the owners.

I was just a bit upset because I went to another shop after (to get these nails off) and they said they would`ve charged me 45$( my sister got the same sparkle nails and it was 45) So maybe I was getting jipped.

Zero class with their dates who have dressed to the nines, yet cuss like sailors waiting for their food at McDonalds.  Loud and unruly in the hallways. I`m all for a good time, but mind your manners. Leaving empty drinks in restrooms and leaving a mess like you are in a gas station is uncalled for.

I previously was in Vegas for a follow up from surgery a month prior and I found out that a friend will have a birthday celebration during the weekend which will be cinco de Mayo. I decided to stay in Vegas  3 more days but had nothing to wear for the event.  There are these pants that are avail only at Saks but In St. Louis they weren`t avail and would`ve taken time I did not have to come. My friend was with me and needed some new shades and it was perfect timing as I wanted to get my mom some perfume ( she loves bond no9) also I wanted to get her a cross body from lv, some mom looking Chanel shoes for Mother`s Day and it was like a one stop shop for us.   Walk to the contemporary section so happy and I walked to a register and politely asked a question upon an item. Before showing an image to give needed info to check, I was directed to where the jean section was. I was so confused as I have never in my life had an associate do that, they normally would look and help. So I say '" I`m sorry is it a new thing where we don`t get to check if item is available.'"? I was told if it`s not over there it`s not there.  My friend came over and said '" you guys don`t check to see if an item is available anymore'"? The lady was beyond hesitant, still did not want to help.  My friend said you know what let`s just ask someone else. As we are walking away the associate and the other at the register continued to stay there. I was so shocked by the treatment there for that moment I was outdone. My friend said wait let`s ask someone else. So as we were walking my friend asked for help and this new associate walked past us and the original associate at the register looked at her like '" the nerve right'" so she asked the individual we just inquired for help... '" you`re back from break'"? So went to ask someone else, I was told to look over in this Jean section.   Again I have never been treated like this at Saks even in cities where you would assume that you would be stereotyped.  I told my friend maybe I appear to not have money, she replied back, I have a damn himalaya birkin, it`s not that.  So instead of my friend purchase of sunglasses, we went to The actual stores and it turned out better because I told each store 3 ( diff stores ) the story and since they knew my friend from being a repeat customer as well as her associates I was treated very well and I bought more than what I planned on because the service was refreshing from what I experienced.  One good thing came out of that bad situation."<11<5<2019<1<50<7

tbqfTVn1iGWJjlgW7LyGGQ<bSPIjHwCJRcvXhZ9ZavPrg<_EybYNGM8hvKQwqUP0-MmA<4<0<0<0<Overall, a solid restaurant with great prices. Surprisingly good food from an unassuming front. The rolls are creative and the servers are nice/attentive. I have been 2x now, and I will definitely keep coming back! It`s not the best Japanese food ever, but it`s really good and the fish is fresh. The first time I stuck with basic stuff (eel avocado, salmon avocado, miso soup, marble soda). The next time my group tried the Maki Mentor roll, which is served in foil on fire. It is pretty impressive. Overall, that one wasn`t our cup of tea--the salmon on top actually cooks, and the resulting texture is unexpected. The roll itself is good, but I`ll stick with the other rolls in the future as the fish is fresh and I`d rather eat it raw. The hot tea is served nicely, but let it brew, as it does not come brewed (which is no issue--it`s not overbrewed!). Overall, a solid choice, you won`t regret it. Kept from 5 stars by: lack of fresh/non-spicy/non-tempura options on sushi menu, limited sashimi/nigiri menu. I know that might just be a personal thing, though, so I wanted to put it out there so no one is scared away from trying this place. You definitely won`t regret going here!<4<11<2019<2<8<58

This last time, Jack was a pretty good server. But, we were very disappointed in the desserts. Before it was four different desserts and they were all delicious. Now, there`s just some type of a little tart and there`s only two different types and they were both awful.   We explained our disappointment to an older Asian lady but she didn`t apologize she just said '"well, now it`s made in house.'" First of all, it didn`t taste like it was made in house. Second of all, and most importantly, we didn`t like either one of them. They could`ve gave us something else for dessert. The scone was a bit extra dry also.   The sandwiches were pretty good though. We got the $35 one instead of the $24 one but I think the $24 one is even better. Overall, the high tea here is just OK. There`s other places that have much better high tea."<9<11<2019<20<3<23

FdSOiLX4zcOvK2OApDM7VA<ufcFOz7hafmAlbf8zRTefg<aEL5t0JAArsrt6SonM5PRg<3<1<1<1<"I think Hawaiian probably has others beat just because of their prime destination offers & the goodies you get while traveling to/from the islands that you can`t really get on other airlines! But, they lack in many ways, too.   Prices are steeper than most other airlines, and I`m not sure why, because I felt like flying American on the way over was a step up from what I experienced on Hawaiian. I can`t complain much about the '"puddle jumper'" from Maui to Honolulu. Old, ghetto plane, but less than an hour flight, so no biggie that the seats are uncomfortable, accommodations less than average & you pretty much just need to get from point A to point B efficiently.   The larger aircraft from Honolulu to Phoenix was a bit better. But they want to charge you to sit anywhere ahead of row 20! No blankets, pillows, and they are VERY stingy with drinks! Will not give you more than 1 small cup. And they didn`t have enough water to accommodate after the first round. There is a great entertainment screen in the back of each seat... but headphones don`t fit the jack, and there is no Bluetooth option. So- it is virtually useless unless you want to watch something with 0 sound or play a game or check the flight status on the map. At least the seats reclined decently & head rests are built to adjust for a '"cradle'".   Their boarding is chaotic. They call first class, and then everyone else piles in line. So you are pretty much walking all over & bumping everyone seated towards the front all the way to the back. Flight attendants don`t really help with anything besides drinks & food. They did offer a free meal, which wasn`t bad. Otherwise, everything costs & I suggest bringing your own bottle of water!   Would I book them again? Only if I am flying to/from the islands. Otherwise, I think other airlines are doing a much better job. And I wouldn`t pay to '"bid'" on an upgrade. That felt insulting. Like: '"maybe if you offer us the right price, we`ll give you a little extra...'" really?? It already costs a ton to begin with! But my biggest suggestion: maybe have more friendly staff that are a bit more helpful & manage a way to let your customers utilize the in-flight entertainment than the useless screen not a single person sitting in my vicinity could figure out how to use. Take note on what some other airlines are doing, because I have found several competitors to be better for less of the cost."<16<11<2019<5<14<38

The food was so good, I literally ate myself sick (my family laughed as I took a lap as a breather).   Admittedly, I didn`t spend a lot of time on side dishes but the sauteed mushrooms, prosciutto, and fresh mozzarella were all very tasty. The lobster bisque was also on point, but I`m not sure if that was a nightly special or a common place.   On to the meat, don`t waste your time with chicken. It`s not because its not good, but seriously with that much freshly grilled steak flying your way, why waste time (and valuable stomach space)  Highlights were the sirloin, flank, and bacon wrapped filet. The sausages were surprisingly good and the pork ribs were extremely tender and delicious. Cooked to perfection.   Thiago, our waiter was very nice and humble.

However, whoever the performer is at the house of tape it`s definitely not the same guy that was on tv.  Within 5 minutes of the show starting I knew it wasn`t him.  My gf got called up on stage and when she sat back down she looked at me and said that`s not the same guy.  I get it if the original tapeface doesn`t want to perform in Vegas but you guys should not advertise it as such.  We will never pay to see the show again and to be honest tapeface just lost two of his biggest fans for life.  Be true to your fans...be honest.  I think we deserve that.

Service was good, came with amuse bouche (pork meatball) and bread, seemed to have a few in the older crowd. I ordered a sparkling water that never came and the bill was split where I had the higher check despite not having any wine, which literally doesn`t make sense. Otherwise it was really better than expected.  Starters ( tuna and caprese) were great, spaghetti was totally on point. I was meh on the gnocchi. Plenty of food for 2!

We arrived at 10:30 am and It was still packed so we waited a while. I wasn`t too bothered by that because I take it as a good sign that the place must be good.   Once we were finally seated I believe It was about 15minutes before some one came and got our drink orders and another 10 by the time we got drinks. We ordered food and waited around 35-40 minutes for our meal. Or more...   I got egg benidicts with a quinoa corn cake which wasn`t all that bad but not worth the wait or the drive.   The manager came over and apologized for the wait which was very nice of her.   My friends also didn`t enjoy their meal and they got the Benedict ranchero.

She didn`t return to fill up our coffee or check on us until we were half way done with our meal. The pancakes were nothing special, just fluffy but I like mine with a little crispy edges and buttery...it was none of that. Instead, to compensate for the lack of texture they added so much sweet toppings to cover the taste. I got the Trio: blueberry danish, pineapple upside down, and pumpkin. Our table also order the OMG french toast, classic snooze, and some hash brown dish. The eggs and hash brown dishes were bland. The OMG French toast was ok too.

The restaurant is cute with fun decor, the service is amazing and the staff is super friendly and welcoming.   The wait was a little over an hour which was expected for a Sunday at noon. Not only is the food is totally worth the wait but they also have a waitress who takes drink orders from the patio area outside and complimentary coffee while you wait which helped make the wait more tolerable too.   The entire cocktail and food menu looked tasty but I decided on the chilaquiles Benedict and a mimosa and my friend chose the pancake flight with the bacon vodka Bloody Mary. Both my mimosa and the Benedict were delicious! The Benedict had perfectly poached eggs and poblano hollandaise over flavorful barbacoa and crispy hash browns on the side.

Their menus is extensive so can be overwhelming and I was I had the opportunity to go back and try some more options. I had the chicken sausage and egg and paired  it with some hash browns. My server kindly recommend a delicious green habanero hot sauce which add the right amount of punch to the meal.  Overall, would definitely recommend this spot just budget enough time. There is ALWAYS a wait (even at 8AM and even for a sole bar seat). This place is probably the most popular breakfast/brunch spot in the city. I overhead waits for over an hour for a table of four.

I want the money I put in this those shit dryers and she just told me, '"they`re working on the dryers and I checked the fire and it`s still lit.'" She literally sat there and was of no assistance. I just left. Took my wet clothes, put them in a bag, and left before I burned that dump to the ground! The owner ought to be ashamed of herself running a place that`s so broken down. I had a bug problem that can only be killed with heat 150 and above so I hope they`re stuck in there and get transferred to the next persons clothes lol avoid this broken down place, go somewhere else where shit actually works and not half ass works just so they can make a quick buck.

I caught bed bugs from my neighbour and the experience cost me $2000 to replace all of my bedding, mattress, box spring and dresser among other items. I received no compensation and the insurance company would not cover anything.   1. They will let ANYONE rent within their buildings. This company does not perform background and/or credit checks. The turn over of tenants in my building was fast and consistent.   2. The main door to the building was constantly left open. And it would take weeks and multiple complaints for them to actually attempt to repair it. The entire door and door frame should have replaced months ago, but instead this company just left the door unlocked and couldn`t care less about tenant safety.  3. Homeless people sleeping within the building and laundry room, building manager knew this and did nothing.  4. When I got the keys to my place it was absolutely filthy and it took them weeks to properly clean it upon multiple requests.   5. No other tenants in the building were told about the bed bug infestation. Emerald cared more about keeping tenants and their money versus being honest about an ongoing situation.  6.  I had to pay for new blinds in the kitchen and bedroom because they were extremely dirty. Emerald did not want to replace these. This cost me $45.00. I also paid for a new lock for my door.  7. My fridge was leaking water and making loud noises, it took them weeks to finally replace the fridge. I received every excuse imaginable for this delay.  8. In an attempt to let executives know what had occurred within my unit/building, I emailed executives and in response received a '"we are sorry this happened'" and '"will look into it'" response. In conclusion, even executives could care less about the well being and treatment of tenants.   This experience caused me severe anxiety and stress and I received no support from their staff. I strongly encourage you to rent elsewhere and never, ever rent from Emerald."<1<12<2019<21<34<0

Shelling out thousands of dollars to a company you`ve never had to do business with before is always scary, especially in the AC business, where you expect to be gouged in the summer. I did my research and got estimates from several different companies, and finally ended up settling on AC Doctors. I`m so glad I did! They were prompt and helpful, and ended up giving me a much more competitive estimate than the other outfits I got quotes from.  Once I decided on AC Doctors, they wasted no time - the unit was installed the next morning. The install was very professional and the unit is doing exactly what it should. Additionally, I had a few questions days after the install, and they`ve been tremendously friendly, responsive, and helpful after the fact - very appreciated, given that they already have my money!  My second AC unit is likely going to need replacement in the next couple of years, and I won`t hesitate to call AC Doctors to do. Super happy to have found an outfit of their quality!<5<8<2019<17<25<8

I told them that they should have told those deliveries that were going to be early/late and give the customer option of not going forward with their order. My husband has not tried them yet.

XTd6BaoIkEC4GL-VVILWIA<p3ALY5fIY2oi6rdahctWdw<aSXmV1DKsbk6UA0TwPkgVA<4<0<0<0<I stayed here on a 6 month lease in 2019. I lived in a lot of places in AZ and this was the best. Rent wasn`t the cheapest for a 1-bedroom; It was $1299 for 482 sq ft. But I liked how the area around it was walkable, including there being a Starbucks nearby. Also, I appreciated working with the front office, as they were very helpful and professional in the end. (In the beginning, I was told incorrect information or not told important information at all with the old staff. The folks there post-remodel were more knowledgeable and professional.)  Surprisingly, the freeway traffic wasn`t a noise concern, as the sound was a steady stream. Any issues I had were with construction/building quality and then a neighbor always slamming things in the apartment below me; however the front office had kindly worked with me to get his door hinge fixed; as it was making most of the noise.  It would have been great if the windows were double pane; for weather insulation and for helping to block sound. You could hear people talking outside and horns honking/cars beeping to lock. But I at least was on a less populated side of the complex and could usually turn on some loud white noise to help me to relax.  They do need to update their gate entry system, to where we have a clicker vs. having to--open up our car window to--enter a code or tap a key fob; modern buildings have this. And it would have been nice if the community area was 24/7 like the gym. I did like the free coffee and snacks; better than other apartment buildings too!  There is a homeless settlement right next to the cemetery (right outside San Portella). I never had issues with the people there. Also, coyotes would howl a lot in the Spring, but I never saw one.  Also, a friend of mine did get her car broken into. Tempe is notorious for break-ins.  Construction:  _____________ Screens were not in place when I had moved in. 1 of them looked like someone had tried to break in from the balcony. Also, my dryer, hot water, ceiling fan and light, and heat all didn`t work when I had moved in. The kitchen sink is so close to the wall and outlet at the bar, that it`s nearly impossible to use; the sink should really be on the other side of the bar/counter. The USB ports are in a bad location too, next to the stove, which is not a good spot to charge something, being so close to food and cooking areas. My soft close drawers would always lift up; they needed to be glued down or fastened better. And the fridge door could only open up so far, limiting how far that I could pull out the vegetable drawer.<2<12<2019<3<6<10
ByOx2f-87DOFvquGm6seyA<0DMMLtO0aspIGMm5Cv4-5w<1WHM7EnTMSjteM9UEr86tA<3<1<0<0<"5/5 for SALES, Joey was very nice and understanding of our needs. I enjoyed the experience in that regard. 2/5 for FINANCIAL, they care most about maximizing their personal profit (I get it`s a business, but meeting us somewhere between invoice and MSRP is how you get lifelong customers).      I had initially went in to purchase a new EXL model of a vehicle using AMEX`s auto program that took a couple thousand off MSRP. I also used the $500 college grad rebate. I opted for the extended warranty and chose a long 84-month term to keep payments low (with the intention of overpayment to allow wiggle room when needed). During the first negotiations, when going from a 72 to 84 month term, the guy said '"we`ll throw in chips, dents, scratches and the payment will be $X'". When looking over the contract, what was '"thrown in'" wasn`t a free addition but an extra $1500 package we didn`t need. We had it removed.   When I came back to switch the car to another model due to concerns over the 1.5 engine with known oil dilution issues, I ended up downgrading the trim from the EXL model to the EX model, but the hybrid version ($$1600 more, around EXL MSRP). Being cyber Monday, there was a $1000 off incentive in my email. I was told I didn`t qualify for this because I was already receiving a greater discount. I was also told they were removing my $500 graduate rebate because of the length of the loan term. When I mentioned we signed with the rebate before at the same 84-month term, the financial guy said sorry that was a mistake.   I ended up paying the base MSRP of the vehicle. No AMEX discount, no cyber Monday $1000 off, no $500 college graduate rebate. There is no real reason I shouldn`t have qualified for these with our combined 750+ credit scores and combined finances. I would have been mostly satisfied if at least the $500 college rebate was honored. Another dealership offered the same vehicle $1000 less than I purchased it (too late).   I love the car I purchased. However, the financial services team are more interested in us meeting THEIR needs than them meeting our needs and helping us save where we can. I get they need to make money too, but gaining life-long customers means meeting somewhere in the middle."<3<12<2019<18<52<48

We attended her rehearsal at the Overture Center in Madison in June of this year. I have attended two of her recitals, and both times I have been shocked by the content of the songs, as well as the sheer length of the performances. During her recital there were songs about sex, male and female genitalia, as well as alcohol, that girls as young as four were dancing to. These songs are not appropriate for kids that age. We sat in the audience, my husband watched, embarrassed by some of the songs that were playing and having little girls dance to them. I`m sure he was not the only one to feel that way. The men danced to songs about wearing long gold chains and sagging pants. Instead of empowering our kids to have respect for themselves, to act like young men and women with class, this show exposed children to songs that they are not at all ready to understand, let alone perform to. This company also made sure my last review was removed from their website, which leads me to believe they are not seeking an honest view of their company from parents with children in their performances and classes. We pay for these classes, and we find the songs you have chosen to be very inappropriate.<7<7<2016<20<5<29

It seemed weird at first going to someone`s house to cook, but she was very kind, warm-hearted, and made us feel welcome. It felt like home, like I was at my aunties learning her cooking secrets! Food was amazing, she cooked us Beef Rendan prior to us getting there. She demonstrated how to make yellow curry, fried rice, and stir fry veggies. She also made us a salad with this peanut sauce (which was amazing btw, this is a must try for sure). Although We would have wanted to try cooking ourselves, we weren`t able to due to time constraints, but still a great demo on how to cook Malaysian food! Overall fun experience, Pon was hilarious, great to talk to, and amazing at what she does. Thanks for the hospitality, until next time!<20<4<2018<18<20<12

For this kind of price, everything should taste like butter and service impeccable. Anywhere in NYC, this type of resistant would charge about 1/3 less. I had the daily omakase for$140.

But the reason i`m leaving another review is because i decided to go with a facial this time around. I`d never gotten a facial before but i hear from my wife these are a great thing for your skincare and even as a guy this is still important! Well let me start by saying sarah ortiz who did my facial was fabulous and caring along the way, she took the time to ask questions on my skincare routine and even gave advance on the do`s and dont`s of helping to keep healthy skin. This was just the beginning she then started to extract any bad stuff on my face and then started exfoliating my skin and mind you while this is going on there is a steamer on your face the whole time that just puts the cherry on top, once this was done she put some product on that helps with your problematic skin for breakouts etc.. then she began`s to gently massage your face , head and neck literally putting you to sleep. Last but not least a Toner is used to help sooth your skin down with everything it just went thru. All said and done i left there with my face fully rejuvenated and a new cut looking and feeling like a million bucks !  Gentlemen jax`s never disappoints and i feel sorry for there competition they have a lot to compete against and this is just the services alone, the customer service is a whole other ball game !<17<8<2019<17<2<51

I must first give a lot of credit to Lauren our waitress who was absolutely outstanding. Her recommendations and  attention to detail plus her  personality will have me asking for her on my next visit in Dec.   This dinner was on May. Her wine recommendations for my guests was spot on with the Golden Eye Duck Horn wine and all our meals were outstanding.   I honestly forgot what I had because we let Lauren basically order for us based on what we preferred.  I promise this time more pictures , better feed back like most of my posts .

Charred lemon leaves stuffed with beef and lamb, apricot wood-fired pizza, rucola salad--all of it was fresh. Even the bloody mary was made of fresh tomatoes: not too salty, and surprisingly topped with homemade bread knot and high-grade salami. Gaston, our server, was passionate about the food and conversational, telling us about the origins of the recipes and the Italian-Argentine cross pollination. Great find.<8<12<2019<22<39<55

A little bit pricier than thai places such as in Chinatown, but the price was worth it. I got the spicy eggplant with fried tofu and it was outstanding. I love how they offer the yelp waitlist feature since this place can get packed especially on the weekends. They also offer mixed drinks, which is different from other Thai places. Parking kinda sucks since it is in the downtown area, but it is worth paying the downtown parking prices! Definitely come check this place out if you`re in the downtown area. One of the best restaurants out there.<9<12<2019<2<9<54

I was having debilitating episodes at least twice a month, each of which would keep me in bed for 24 hours.  Previously, I had been treated at the AGH Hearing and Balance Center, with no relief.  I have not had an episode since being treated by Qiong. Qiong has also given me total relief from sinus issues which would regularly trigger asthma attacks.  Most recently I was diagnosed with high Mercury levels. Qiong is treating me with a foot bath that draws the heavy metals out of my body. Qiong always asks questions and listens intently.  She is extremely knowledgable, having been a hematologist in China.  She is truly a one of a kind.  I travel one hour to her office on a regular basis, and the trip is truly worthwhile.  I would recommend her to anyone with medical issues.  In fact, UPMC thinks so highly of her that they refer their head injury patients to her!<3<11<2018<20<36<47

I called to reschedule the appointment and was told I could be seen the following week.  I already had plans for the following week.  I was then told it would be another month before I could be seen again.  After a referral from my primary care physician, I would have waited a total of 3 months in order to see this provider.  Possibly this practice is handling too many clients and should not be taking on any new clients.  So sad!<5<10<2019<5<36<31

6YiALldAqTrGD1ALnsB46g<cLK54cehHEgD4AYNyMptTQ<dqbaOPNOFHFF-4JAlhozQQ<1<10<0<0<I`ve been a customer here since 2011. It was a great practice when I first started going, but customer service and patient care have definitely taken a nose dive since then. Today was the straw that broke the camel`s back. Without going into much detail, a hygienist by the name of Leah exhibited a shocking lack of professionalism and bedside manner. I actually got out of the chair and left. I have no intention of going back. In addition to today`s incredibly disappointing service, I`ve noticed other things. Among them, there is no continuity of care. Every time I go in I have a different hygienist and dentist. For that reason it`s impossible to establish a meaningful doctor-patient relationship and quality of care suffers. Additionally, every time I go in I get a different story on copays. Sometimes there is one, sometimes there isn`t, but the specific course of treatment never changes - it`s always the same. My insurance has never changed either, so I`m perplexed why they can`t keep track of my copayment. Lastly, they`re notorious for canceling appointments at the last minute, so when you`re supposed to be coming in every 3-4 months, but haven`t been in for 8, they make you feel like a bum for not making an effort to get your teeth cleaned, when in reality, they`re the ones who make it impossible to visit on a regular basis. I`m done with this place and recommend it to no one. Worst dental experience ever.<17<9<2014<2<51<27

Had I not searched on Yelp, it would have not be noticed from the main street. Its a family owned business in a cozy, clean interior.  At first seated, the friendly server brought us fruit infused water, which was so refreshing. The menu has a large variety of vietnamese and even some chinese. The server was so helpful in recommending some dishes.  We ordered their popular thin rice noodles with grilled pork,  stuffed pancake, seafood noodle soup in shrimp paste, and oxtail noodle soup. I enjoyed sampling all and it was incredibly tasty in a subtle way. The tender oxtails were whole pieces and not cut up which I really appreciate the full benefit of.  That in itself will bring me back and to try more of their unique specialties. Oh, and don`t be surprised to see mostly asian clientele. Got to try this hidden gem!<2<10<2019<21<0<15

I went to three other stores in this shopping center before finally making my way here in hopes of finding a workable watchband. Thank goodness they had several options for me! They have a coupon in the Simon VIP club for 25% off one item so make sure to sign up for access to the VIP passport!  The guys who work here were all super helpful and let me know if there was anything they didn`t have in store they could order from the iPad and have it shipped to me for free - great customer service!

I`m like first of all, I don`t have gas services, second where is the paperwork and why are you jumping my fence. He claims that this was his third attempt and that Southwest gas gave him the green light to jump the fence if no one answered on the third try. Here`s the actual problem I called the company he works for and the girl says that this is allowed for which I`m just baffled. Then I ask if she can tell me or show me where the paperwork for the prior techs is. She then tells me that she`ll get back to me but she totally didn`t.

Following completing of the project, Grant was also available to assist with an automation/heater programming issue.  Their service is much appreciated.   I would recommend them to 99.5% of Las Vegas residents.  The only reason that you might consider another builder would be for a completely unique design for a super high-end pool.  However, I do see that they are quite capable in that area as well (see photos of guitar-themed pool).<31<10<2019<19<3<1

And I must say, this place did not disappoint. The restaurant itself is a small location with limited seating. The only thing - I was not a huge fan of the smell within the store, it has a heaby odour from the meat, I would prefer not to sit and eat inside.  The service was very friendly and quick, they brought my sandwich to me in a few minutes after I ordered.   Now onto the good stuff - the sandwiches! I had the camel club ($11). The sandwich was pretty good and extremely flavourful. Plenty of food for the price paid and the sandwich was packed with chicken.  All in all, I would definitely come again if I was in the area!<1<11<2019<22<57<59

'"Don'" doesn`t waste your time and will give you the advice you need/want. He knows his stuff and I promise you that he will do what it takes to get you what you want. Even at 9:30 at night.

Do NOT under any circumstances hire this company to move you.  Do you use to trust with your belongings and home.   Moving Date:  6/26/2019  Was suppose to arrive between 12noon-2pm.  At 1:30pm I phoned the company and they had NO record of my booking and said the movers needed to look me up manually.  MOVERS: For the most part were very nice people, but obviously cannot read nor do they pay attention.  ALL my boxes were clearly marked on all 4 sides which room they were to be moved into.  I placed SIGNS on the rooms so they knew which was which.  We did a walk thru at the new home and all was clear UNTIL after I paid the OVERPRICED bill and had to deal with the arrogant and asshole, Walter in Dispatch who spoke to me like I was a 12 year idiot vs a grown woman who DOES know a thing about business and how to treat people.    Once the payment was made, they proceeded to complete the move in.  Once they left I discovered they PILED bedroom boxes in my kitchen (although they had placed bedroom boxes IN the bedroom before, so it wasn`t foreign to them) AND kitchen boxes in my living room.   The kicker - they heavily and I mean HEAVILY damaged a wall at my previous home and new home.  Gaping holes and window blinds ruined.  They NEVER once pointed it out to me, they waited me for me to see it. Then, they acted all jittery like I should of not seen it.    I was told the walls would be repaired in both residences.  Here is where it gets insane.    1st appointment set 10 days after the move in.  Walter calls (of course) the day of tells me that the '"Handyman'" was out of town (like they didn`t know this when they booked it) and needed to be rescheduled.  2nd appointment booked and of course, now I am being told '"something came up'" and the Handyman could not come the day of.   3rd appointment booked and lo and behold the Handyman showed up.  I had all the paint all he had to do was fix it.  His EXACT words when he saw the holes in my wall:  '"What in the world did they do to your house???'"  He fixed the holes and told me he would be back '"tomorrow'" to texture and paint.  The next day comes and I am told by Jasmine AND Walter that '"something came up'" and reschedule again.  Not going to waste my time with them, I have rearranged my schedule enough for them and this simple job.  Handyman was wonderful and nice but I could tell something was amiss and he was BSing me too. Only takes a few moments to let the wall filling to dry, doesn`t take all day.  I am not stupid, I have painted plenty of walls to know how it done.    4th appointment scheduled and guess who do I hear from the day before?  Walter telling me that the Handyman is going to be out of town (again).  They are bullshitting me because they have NOT even repaired my previous home either.  We will be filing for a small claims against them for fraud.  They underestimate what the power of social media can do to them.  This is how my home looks right now..3 weeks after the move out.  They are corrupt and frauds. Do NOT hire them and ensure anyone you know who is moving NOT to use them.  Just look at all the bad Yelp and Google reviews.  I look forward to hearing they have been shut down and out of business.    In addition, I have filed a charge back claim with my bank for fraud and misrepresentation of services.  They are responsible for fixing these repairs and they are not, plus they WILL double charge for '"travel'" or '"driver fees'".  Let that sink in.  You get enough complaints you you won`t be able to accept credit cards any longer.  Oh well - run an honest business and you wouldn`t have this problem."<15<7<2019<23<57<31

Stopped in during the early afternoon and was greeted by the staff.  Felt very welcome and was very impressed with the outgoing and charming Hanna.  We stayed for a beer, then returned later that evening for the live band.  We ended up closing the bar.  So much fun, we returned the following evening for more entertainment by the band (tony marques band, A+++).  The staff and the other fun loving customers were so much fun.  This bar is defiantly a must visit when you are in Vegas.  You will find yourself not wanting to leave & will likely return over and over again.  Special shout out to the beautiful girls Blair, Hanna & Alyssa.  The service and the girl`s bubbly personalities & charm really made this bar.  I also had great service and conversations with the manager and bouncer.  The only thing I would offer as an improvement would be an old-school Juke box with 45s on vinyl.

I signed a waiver not to wrap any of my furniture which was a mistake ended up the trainee busted my fireplace and the leather sofa which still had tags on it had a huge hole in it.

Finally the host/server came & I told her: table for 1 please. She gave me a sour face & took the menu with such half-ass effort & attitude. Sat me down next to where a technician was working on the ceiling panel. Wouldn`t you think to place me somewhere where my food would be safe from particles falling from the ceiling?   That was not the worst part. I sat down at my table for a full 10 minutes before walking out because NOBODY paid enough attention to come & take my order. I saw 4 female servers behind the cash register just talking & laughing whilst I was eagerly waiting to place my order before heading to the airport but no one wanted to look my way even when I was trying to flag them down.

ZA9zHfPOIWyeFSCAhTqE-g<D4GMqFaWTOVsVCvJi6V35w<74vqVbTFUYqvSqrBiVj6RA<2<5<0<0<I have to say, as one of the biggest apartment managements, Mozart is not as good as others. First of all, and the most important thing, they are not honest. They just want your money, and they can say whatever you would like to hear but they never do anything in their service. They do not try to help you fix problem, and they do not want to take any responsibility. You pay parking, they do not care about your car was damaged by their fault. You pay fees, they make laundry and garbage more and more inconvenient. Elevator always has problems. They increase rent year by year, but their service is worse and worse daily. The reason I gave 2 star is because it is truly better than some other small companies, but it does not mean Mozart is worth 2 stars.<19<4<2016<15<58<45
GkGD--EnjUtUdNuRngeSFg<P2p4saBzroc3fzABXr4vxg<74vqVbTFUYqvSqrBiVj6RA<1<1<0<0<"I have had a parade of horrors since moving into the Parklane 4 years ago...Let me start from the beginning.  First, a week after I moved in, a piece of the building fell off and shattered my car`s back window. I was parked in the outdoor lot.  Mozart refused to reimburse me for any damage and said I was parking there at my own risk.  I was paying to park in their outdoor lot on their premises, but a falling piece of building was a risk that I was supposedly to know of. Ok.  Second, one night I woke up to water pouring out of the vents in my apartment. Mozart had to tear up drywall and clean the entire mess up because a pipe burst several floors above and was leaking into the apartments below. Ok.  Another instance of Mozart`s complete lack of care for maintenance of the Parklane surrounds the numerous power and water outages that have plagued the residents there.  There have been two times when water was shut off for more than 24 hours.  Only of those times,  water was trucked in for residents who had to literally carry water by the bucket load to their apartments to wash dishes and flush toilets.  The other time water was not trucked in. I had to go to Target to buy gallons of water so that I could flush my toilet.  I had to leave my apartment and stay at my parents` house (outside of Pittsburgh) so that I could have running water, as Mozart had no idea when water would be restored.  As for the power outages, try living in a place that has 24 floors when power is shutoff and you have to take the stairs...not fun.  Probably my biggest issue with Mozart is the heating/cooling system.  Mozart runs seasonal heat/air on a system from the 1960s that pumps hot and cold water to heat and cool the building.  I lived above the 10th floor and let me tell you I never used the heat even when it was below freezing out.  This is because all of the hot air from the lower floors rise up to the upper floors.  When it is mid-fall and mid-spring it is Hell on earth.  Any time the outside temps are above 60F my apartment routinely gets to be 80F.  Mozart refuses to switch the heating over to air until they deem the temperatures are '"sufficiently warm for a continuous amount of time.'" Basically, you are at their mercy. I have to use multiple industrial fans to survive spring/fall because it is so hot.  I cannot sleep at night until they turn the air conditioning on.  Their logic is completely flawed..they don`t want the people living on the lower floors to be without heat if it gets cold...Can`t they put layers on or use blankets if it is cold at night?  The people living above the 10th floor cannot do anything to mitigate the heat. It is truly miserable.  I would advise against anyone considering living in the Parklane. The building is over 50 years old and Mozart is using band-aids to patch glaring problems. The price of rent is not worth the plethora of issues I have had to deal with the last 4 years. They should be ashamed of how they treat their residents."<8<4<2015<11<49<40

Tried it for the first time since I was in the neighborhood & wanting some good New Mexico Food, that other place you know the one was much further away so I thought I`d give this a try.  I`m glad I did, the food was excellent!    I ordered takeout from Chile Addiction & had the Pork Verde with regular green chili & an order of the Chicken Tamales with regular green chili.  Let me start with the pork Verde, it was OUTSTANDING! The Chili was the perfect heat level, it was moist, delicious and large chunks of pork. The pinto beans had a really nice smokey bacon flavor and were very good.   The second order was the chicken tamale plate & that one I was less thrilled with. The masa was really thick, with little to no flavor overall. The chicken was fine, the tamale had a fair amount of chicken in it, but honestly I`ve had much better tamales. Overall I was very happy with the food, the staff, & the service.  I`ll absolutely be coming back to try that green chili burger!!<21<9<2019<2<46<9

Update - I`ve now had acupuncture twice and cupping twice from Dr Sonya.  I`ve also gotten a few magnesium shots - to help with migraines and muscle cramping.    I`m so impressed.   She really cares that I`m in pain and wants to help.   Her prices are so much better than anywhere else.

Many of the meat dishes here didn`t taste as heavy or creamy to me as many other Indian restaurants, which I appreciated. The naan also wasn`t coated in butter. I particularly enjoyed a spicy beef dish, the puff rice (great to snack on even when you`re stuffed) and the tandoori chicken.   Pro tip: make sure you check in on Yelp to get the 10% discount and also use the buy 1 get 1 half off if you`re there for lunch. Normally it`s about $20 per person which I don`t think is really worth it given the relatively small selection of food but with all of the discounts it`ll be closer to just about $10 per person!<18<3<2016<14<38<8

I had an acute lumbar disc herniation earlier this year, accompanied by severe pain, leg numbness, and significant quadriceps weakness. The latter was bad enough that it was hard to negotiate stairs. I walked with a limp, and running, cycling, etc. were completely out of the question. Initially the pain was fairly debilitating too- I could not sit or stand for more than seconds at a time. Brendan custom-designed a rehabilitation program, including a combination of electrostimulation, stretching, strength, and flexibility exercises targeting my deficits. I made steady progress, relatively rapidly, towards recovery. The pain largely resolved after 3-4 weeks, while the numbness and weakness persisted. However, Brendan stayed with me and we continued to work on my deficits, making steady progress, until the numbness and weakness have entirely resolved about 5 months following the injury.   I can honestly say that I never would have re-gained the function of the affected muscles without Brendan`s expertise, support, and patience. I am eternally grateful to him and his staff for making it possible for me to return to a normal life. I can`t thank them enough, and I highly recommend Contact Physical Therapy.<19<11<2014<23<27<3

My first experience at this location right after it opened was not great. I originally gave it two stars for very slow service. This time it was much better.  We came on a Friday night and were sat right away on the patio. It was a bit humid but it is monsoon season.  The monsters and fans helped. It`s a bit noisy, but that`s to be expected.  And they did have a really good live DJ.  Our apps and drinks came out quickly this time. Food still took a while but they checked on us often.<7<9<2019<3<1<18

This is actually my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. I have celebrated my last 3 birthdays here and I make sure everyone in my party tips greatly because that`s the kinda person I am. I was really good friends with the General Manager David back in the day. I recently went to Texas de Brazil and I have 8 people with me. I had a reservation and the hostess refused on seating us because 3 people were missing. I said are you serious? We finally get sat and everything seems to be going great till we get our checks. I had 2 nurses in my group and they informed me they give discounts for doctors and nurses and ETC. I then say oh that`s great. I get my servers attention and I then tell him I`m actually a doctor DVM. The servers than say oh it`s only for regular doctors. I look at him and say are you kidding? A doctor is still a doctor whether it`s humans or animals. I discard his stupid comment and ask him if he can add my bill to my friends since they are nurses and he looks at me and says I have to ask my manager because of the bill Is already discounted and all. It was so embarrassing for me and my guest. I just then paid but I admit I didn`t tip because I was disappointed. For a 50 dollar restaurant, the service was terrible. I guess I won`t be attending this place ever again.   WOW I don`t even know why I`m writing this. I guess it`s to give all customers a look of how they can be treated. I went to this place again for my birthday and wow I can`t believe how unprofessional the server was and so embarrassing to. I will never attend this place again.<11<11<2019<23<32<13

TS_NbocbwqORN9teIvyeqw<812l_d7e42R1S80ShzOy1A<MZdFfPLqkiBClj97lvhtPw<5<1<0<1<A true hidden gem in Las Vegas.  Came in with a party of 4 for lunch today. We ordered the eel, minced pork with egg, and the three preserved meat rice bowls. The rice bowls are cooked fresh so it does take a little while to come out. A salty egg custard comes with the bowls for you to enjoy while you eat. The first bite shocked me- the texture was amazing and the flavor definitely hit.   When the rice first comes out, I recommend that you to mix from the bottom of the bowl so that the rice doesn`t overcook by the time you get to that part.   My personal favorite of the 3 was the eel (I`m biased, eel + rice is my favorite meal) and the three preserved meat. The minced pork was yummy also but the other two were just sooo on point.   Our waters and teas were refilled promptly without us asking.  Overall: Great authentic tasting food, great service, plenty of parking, strong AC- I will definitely be back!<10<9<2019<22<27<14

I also requested a quote though yelp.  Within an hour he had called me back.  I felt his price was good for what I needed so I asked when he could come out.  He offered a couple time slots that conflicted with my work schedule.  Once I explained when I was available, he offered to come out that evening.  Who does that?  Seriously, same day service around my schedule at a good price.    The service was great.  He sent me several text messages checking in in the hour or so leading up to my appointment.  I had 3 rooms to clean, one was pretty gross due to my dog peeing in there and me not noticing it.  He got right in there, sticking his nose in the carpet to find the stains.  Rob placed corner guards everywhere his hoses might rub on the walls; a nice touch I thought.  After soaking the spots, he used a special tool to help suck the cleaner etc out of the pad.  Everything looked great.  He provided booties for me and my kids to walk on the wet carpet and warned us several times about how the tile would be very slippery when exiting the rooms.  He even provided a bottle of pet stain cleaner.   This is next thing he did really set him apart.  After the pet treatments, the soaking, and the extra suction, a couple spots that were really stubborn, still smelled.  I asked Rob if he could recommend anything else that I could do to get rid of the smell.  Instead of pointing me to the bottle of pet cleaner he kindly left behind, he recalled my schedule and offered to come out a 2nd time at no charge that evening!  He said all my work is guaranteed. Seriously people, a stand up guy.  These tough stains are completely my fault.  He did everything I asked the first time and would`ve been completely justified in charging me for a second treatment of those stains.  Instead he came back at my convenience without a charge.  How a company handles their customers after a sale really tells you what kind of company they are.    What a great experience!  I will continue to hire Rob and recommend him every chance I get!<10<10<2019<4<21<15

I usually get takeout so I`m not sure what a dining experience is like. They always say 5-10 minutes when you go in to order but it ends up taking 15 minutes which isn`t a huge deal.  I got the mixed BBQ platter with 2 choices. I chose BBQ duck, pork, and got chicken fried rice with it. Also came with bok choy.

I waited 1 hour and 45 minutes for some pepperoni and sausage pizza rolls ( I think that`s what they`re called ?) and an order of wings . The wait time was no big deal , since that`s the time the told me when I ordered . The delivery guy kept calling me & yelling at me because he couldn`t find my apartment number . the prick hung up on me twice .  So overall it took about two hours for my food to get here and the food was OKAY.

I did see that they have a Cuban Panini and I thought I would give it a try. I love Cuban Sandwiches and felt that this would be a treat. So I ordered and the lady had such a straight face. Maybe it`s to early in the morning. She prepared the Panini and it was good. They only have the pink packet (Equal) like sugar and white sugar. I asked the lady if they had the green packets (Stevia) or yellow packets (Splenda). She said that they did not. She said that I could go to the other coffee shop at the airport that it`s owned by them. Although the sandwich was good, I personally did not like the coffee at all. I don`t remember the last time I threw coffee away after a sip. I may have been able to tolerate if they had sugars that I use.

When I began my journey to become a nomad I had no idea where to begin so I watched YouTube videos for a year. So many portable home choices to consider: class A, class B, class C, fifth wheels, travel trailers, truck campers. Fortunately, there are some very helpful channels by full-time RV`ers who offer advice to newbies. Do your homework. There are also many videos made by regretful people who chose the wrong type of home on wheels.  After deciding that I needed a truck camper, I began watching videos for this segment and visiting various manufacturer websites. Enter Tom`s Camperland. The Host Industries website lists Tom`s as a dealer of Host truck campers.  I also read many reviews of Tom`s on Yelp. Tom`s has many happy customers.  I contacted Tom`s via email with a few general questions. Allen, the General Manager (?), answered my concerns within 24 hours.  After the initial contact, Allen became my go-to for silly questions ('"you guys sell propane toilets, right?'"). I spent the summer of 2019 locating the proper truck for a truck camper and Allen checked in with me on a weekly basis during the process. That meant a lot. He was serious about staying in touch. At this point I should mention that I live in Denver, Colorado and Tom`s Camperland is in Phoenix, Arizona. That`s an 865 mile drive.  As November rolled around, I was ready to purchase and drove to Phoenix in my 2005 Dodge 3500 dually diesel. Mike McFadden shook my hand upon arrival and immediately began showing me Tom`s selection of truck campers. That was day 1-look, but don`t buy. I visited two of the three Tom`s locations. Each location features selections by different manufacturers.  On day 2 I asked Mike for his advice on which camper he would most like to own. To my surprise, he didn`t push the brand that he owns. Instead, Mike showed me a camper that is, essentially, leak-proof due to the construction process. It was also substantially cheaper than the Host camper I was considering. Don`t get me wrong, Host makes big, beautiful truck campers with 17 slide outs and enough interior room for hopscotch and back handsprings (stick the landing!), but their construction is typical. Think seams...  I purchased a 2019 Northern Lite 10-2 truck camper and, while Mike was generating the paperwork, struck up a conversation with Angela at the front desk. Angela has lived in Phoenix since the dawn of forever. She`s the glue that holds everything together at Tom`s. Need a place to stay overnight in Phoenix? How about a nice restaurant? Want to learn how to build fire-breathing snowmen in the desert? Ask Angela. Great lady, very personable.  Day 3 involved orientation. Once you purchase a home on wheels, you need to familiarize yourself with the various onboard systems: propane, solar, and batteries. Adan is the man who provides you with the answers to all of your questions. He educated me very well. Never mind that I forgot most of what he told me! Adan told me to text him if I had any future questions. I have, and he`s always answered my concerns satisfactorily. Mike McFadden has also refused to stop answering my questions after the sale. These are great people who love what they do, and love America. TIP: Ask questions and/or take notes, or better yet, use your phone to record the orientation. Adan isn`t camera-shy.  You can`t go wrong when shopping at Tom`s Camperland, folks. The employees are genuinely nice people who respect boundaries and offer no high-pressure sales tactics as they are not paid on commission. They are also unabashedly pro-America. WWG1WGA!  Thank you!

I had high hopes that I would get to enjoy the beauty that is Snooze more than once a year.  When we arrived after 9:30 on a Sunday, we were quoted a 60-75 minute wait which proved to be true - it took almost 75 minutes on the dot. We made our way over to Half-Priced Books in the meantime to cool off and get a little retail therapy in.  Once we were seated, we took our time to review the menu and make our choices. The only downside was that our server frequently checked in on us despite only a few minutes having passed each time. Not a huge deal though. Our food took a while to be brought out which was fine as well - we knew what we were getting into.   My issue came when the food actually arrived. I looked at my Sandwich I Am and noticed there was no cheese on it. I tried to ask my server to take care of it, and she explained that the cheese was actually inside the eggs. As I made my way through the sandwich, I confirmed that there was no cheese anywhere to be found. After waiting so long to eat, I didn`t want my food to disappear from my sight so I made do. Maybe the chefs are still working out the kinks with their consistency.  The other downside was the massive number of people who crammed around the bar as they waited for their tables. I`m not sure how this can be prevented - bar service outside? Fans to cool off the people waiting in line?   Overall - decent food, long wait, lots of people.<29<7<2016<19<21<18

The morning of we received a text message from the '"manager'" that the cleaner had called in sick and they would have to reschedule for another day. Told them this was not acceptable, and if they couldn`t clean the house that day we would like a refund as our event was that night. No response.  Husband asked again, no response. I messaged them that we were very disappointed,  and if one of our scheduled cleaners (we booked two) couldn`t make it, why couldn`t the other one still come? Or why couldn`t the manager come? Recieved a response back that we hadn`t asked for that, WHY SHOULD WE HAVE TO ASK? If those were options they should have offered them instead of just saying they had to come another day.

I got the pancake flight with sweet potato, blueberry Danish, and strawberry coconut (the pancake of the day)  plus a peanut butter cup pancake.

Mango salad 4/5- mango was fresh and in season the sauce complemented the dish. Only complaint is the fried wrap it came with was kind of stale.   Pad kee mao 4.5/5 - one of my fave dishes on the menu. Beef fried flat noodle it is a bit spicy but good.   Chicken pad Thai 4/5 - decent pad Thai full of flavour. Comes with side dish of raw bean sprouts if you need extra    Pla rad pirk- 4/5 deep fried fried topped with spicy tamarind sauce and basil. Fish was super moist and fresh. Comes with a side of rice. Becareful of the spicy peppers !   Lastly tried the gaeng massaman curry with chicken 3/5 - this was my least favourite dish because the chicken was dry and sauce lacked flavour and kind of watery. Also potatoes were undercooked. Note this dish does come with a side of rice.   Overall would be back if I`m craving Thai food!<17<8<2019<17<24<2

To put it simply, the Poppy Foundation is a couple of cat ladies with a business license. I will not deter you from donating or helping the kitties in anyway. The supplies are few and the cats suffer from this. For example, empty cat litter boxes with a few shreds of paper for litter. paper plates with dried up wet food and dry food scattered all over the floor. And the smell! This organization had moved locations and the SMELL still remains. Its called proper hygiene. Ive been to kennels and boarding facilities and other vets offices that don`t have this smell. And its not cute kitten breath.   Getting to the bigger picture, I want to talk about ethics and discrimination. A few months ago a rescued a sweetheart from the freeway. THE FREE WAY! How that baby got there I can only imagine. All I know is that I was going to save this kitty. I collect strays of all kinds. Not long ago my partner and I rescued Geoffrey. He had been lost and roaming Las Vegas for over a year. He was saved and actually returned to his owner. His story made news headlines...anyway, to the point.  I rescued this kitty and called my friend who works at BONANZA CAT HOSPITAL (look for my review on them) I call them because I have a friend that works there and they could help as this was what they do. She calls me back to tell me '"there is no room at the inn'" so to speak. She guides me to every other option in the book. Kitty Farms that are closed, or not answering phones cause they are full. I keep kitty overnight in a friends garage. I would have kept the kitty myself, but I have a special needs kitty with a sensitive heart condition and I couldn`t sacrifice one for the other. Luckily I made this rescue kitty comfortable, watered and fed overnight with friends.  I try to take kitty to the no kill shelter here on Dewey..FULL as well. Since I can not foster for 2 months like they needed me to do, I take kitty back to the car and start making more phone calls for placement (friends, family, more shelters)  My friend who worked at the Bonanza Cat Hospital which is in direct conjunction with the POPPY FOUNDATION, says bring the cat to us.  I am so thankful and I drive us all back across town to the exact location I called the night before. Suddenly, there is '"room at the inn'"  Just yesterday, after trying to attain my kitties file to move onto a new vet, DR. LINDA STEELMAN reminds me of the time a few months ago of when I was looking for somewhere to bring the kitty, she has the audacity to mention that '"she knew that it was Me who was asking for help, and that is why she wouldn`t take the rescue.'" '"Only because my friend who works there asked, did she decide to take the kitty!'"   This is where the discrimination and violation of Veterinary Ethics comes in. Her statement alone violates her sworn duty to protect and care for these animals. She has every right to be a bigot and refuse my business. But she has NO RIGHT and it is a travesty to turn away a lost kitty like that, based on her hatred for my orientation.   I am still in shock that she has the gumption in this day and age to treat people this way. I thought this foundation was based around helping the kitties.   Both Lina Steelman and Linda Newman are counterparts in this facility and this foundation. They will try and tell you that '"they only rent the facility'" or that they have nothing truly to do with one another. But that is absolutely untrue. They make decisions together, and they discriminate together as well. LINDA NEWMAN is the Office Manager at Bonanza, and President of the POPPY FOUNDATION. So you`re not separate, you`re definitely equal.    To be clear, I have known about and supported this group since 1999. I have sent business to them, I have sent rescues to them and I have supported their efforts.   I also raise money for and support  Heaven Cant Wait Circus Couture (raising money for pediatric cancer research, local non profit) Super Summer Theatre Opportunity Village The Center  ...these are just the local organizations I support and donate my time and efforts to. So I am by no means a terrible person, or a person who tries to bring down a good thing. I just wanted the truth of these two bullies, and the moderators of their Facebook page, who cyber bullied me for making this review, to come to light.   Sincerely,  a devoted pet owner for life and a proud parent of a Special Needs Kitty of 17years."<7<8<2015<15<11<23

The big brother next door has a policy to prevent workers cherrypicking items (not allowed to buy until 2 days), hence they are truly a customer first company, and that reflects in the high amount of traffic they get. When I asked some of the regulars why they dont go to talize, they just said a waste of time. And its true. Nothing worth buying, majority is outdated mall clothes. Ive witnessed the girl at showcase this morning by change room take something out and hid it in the corner for her to buy later on. All those bags behind cashiers....staff - cherry picked them for themselves.   When I told an staff that the racks are too crowded to the point that I cant even browse...they shrugged it off by saying '"more selections'" ..when in reality its no one is buying there ish.   Since the renovation- prices have gone way too high. 90% of the store is outdated H&M for 10$...why not just go to H&M and get it new for just a bit more. Their '"showcase'" IE the best they have to offer is old Michael Kors shoes and Coach bags that only your 50 yr old Aunt would want.

At $59 per person, it is not a bad deal for the great selection of food you`re getting, and getting to enjoy the live jazz band while you`re brunching is a plus.  This time around, it was an amazing birthday celebration for my dad, from beginning to end! The hostess was friendly, offered to hang our winter coats, and came back to check up on us and my dad to make sure he was enjoying himself. Our server, Christopher, was lovely - he gave us a tour and came by to surprise my dad with a birthday cake and candle, while the wonderful trio jazz band played '"Happy Birthday'". Best part was that my dad turned 74 this year, so he got 74% off his meal with Ricarda`s birthday special. Love it!  And near the end, when the fluffy pancakes ran out, I asked the pancake station cook if there were any more, and he surprised me by having the chef especially make me some special lemon ricotta pancakes that they don`t usually have on Sunday brunch days. It was so sweet of him to come up to me unexpectedly with the pancakes and I enjoyed it thoroughly with the airiest and freshest vanilla bean whipped cream (you can see the vanilla bean black dots in it!) and wild blueberry compote. It tasted like cloud 9! Needless to say, the service was fantastic!  Rest of the food was great as always - oysters were fresh; foie gras was tasty and I`m always a fan of the grilled eggplant and the DIY s`mores bar with the roast your own marshmallows! Only thing that could`ve made it perfect was if the hot carving stations with the prime rib, porchetta and glazed salmon were hotter temperature wise and the meats more tender. Other than that, I can always count on Ricarda`s for a good time and the best Sunday brunch ever!"<18<11<2019<0<9<11

The menu is quite extensive with many interesting offerings (including the drink menu!) Although I did not drink on my visit, I would be interested in returning to sample the frozen cosmos. For food, I had the entree mac n` cheese, which was MASSIVE! It was seriously 3-4 meals of delicious cheesy goodness on one plate. I really enjoyed  the meal, and my friend enjoyed her burger.

We were seated and got water but that was the last contact we had for over 15 minutes. No one bothered to acknowledge us even though we were seated right by the kitchen pickup area rather than tucked in a corner. I waited tables in college and know that you never, ever ignore a customer. It takes 10 seconds to stop and say, '"I`m super busy but will be with you in a moment'". No one likes to be ignored.

I stopped using them for some reason but can`t remember only that it had to do with customer service. I started using them again a few years back. I even subscribe to their maintenance plan. They called me to schedule my spring check up and was scheduled a window from 4-7 on 6/14/19. I left work early so I could be home in case they showed at 4. I waited and waited. 7 pm came and went. Finally, I`m getting ready for bed a little after 8pm and the technician calls to say he is on his way. I said, '"you were supposed to be here by 7.'" He said, '"didn`t anyone call you?'" No one called me. It would still be a half hour before he would arrive. I told him don`t bother. They kept calling me and leaving messages to reschedule.   I finally called on 7/1 to reschedule. The woman I talked to tried to tell me I would have to pay for the visit. Uh...no...it`s covered in the maintenance plan. I`m not paying. Besides, what nerve! They made me miss work for nothing. Anyway, she checked and said, oh yes, you`re covered. I`ll note it on here and she scheduled me 4-7 for 7/11, or so I thought. The next day I get a call from Julie because she sees that the technician didn`t log the call for my scheduled visit on 7/1. OMG! The lady that scheduled me put in the wrong date! So Julie made sure I was scheduled for the 11th. Left work early that day to make it home by 4. Guess what? It`s 6:30 and I figure I better call. The lady I talked to says, '"Oh, he won`t be there until after 7.'" They were so busy she forgot to call me and I guess they were so busy last month too that they forgot to call. I am fuming at this point. I told her I want half of my maintenance plan refunded. She said she would have someone call me the next day. No one ever called!!   So, on a side note. On one of the visits to my house, the technician tells me I overpaid for my system. He said I paid $1k too much just for the Trane label. He said if you pull the Trane label off it`s the same as American Standard. You know, I let that ride at the time. It didn`t sit well having a company rep telling me they screwed me out of my hard earned money. But I`m done now. I want my money back and if they give me a hard time, I`m going to lose my s#!t. It`s not like I`m asking them to reimburse me for the 2 hours of work I had to miss, just what they failed to deliver.

My first experience was definitely subpar. I had booked Belon for Montreal a table, as I forgot that it already been for oyster mania. However, my second experience here was phenomenal. It seems like they`ve gotten more organized and they were able to keep up with the demands of the clientele.  I will start with the food. Because it was for the set menu of Montreal a table, I had very specific dishes available from the kitchen. The choices were actually really good ranging from oyster Rockefellers to salmon tartare to octopus to fish and a variety of desserts. You could also order from the cold bar. They had around 6 to 7 different varieties of oysters. The food was extremely well executed well presented and really delicious. I had the salmon tartare as a starter and then the octopus with pearl couscous and finally the brownie. I highly highly recommend the octopus and the brownie.  The service was a lot better than during my first visit. They were very attentive and your water was always being filled. The waiters are very friendly. And because we sat at the oyster bar we saw the oyster shuckers and they were very friendly.

The food sometimes varies depending on who is in the kitchen as far as spices go, but I usually go for the half priced apps after 9 anyway.   (when I am paying half for my food I am not as picky).  The managers are all super nice as well when they talk to you and are pretty helpful if you need to speak to them.

Whether I`m dropping off a box that`s already wrapped and labeled, or a bunch of stuff that needs to be packaged up, weighed, and labeled, they are always helpful, trustworthy and professional. I leave the store with peace of mind, knowing if my package doesn`t arrive, it`s not going to be because of them.   Also, as my business has grown, I realize how important it is to have a good relationship with a conveniently located mail store. I`ve had many good conversations with both Michael and Danny about business and they are always fascinating conversations. These guys are BOTH very smart and they do run a tight ship! (I think that`s a pun intended...)  I am so glad they are a part of the neighborhood, about a two blocks away.

hWqVJzn_9RJnUhKuiXE6SA<GpTlLaNcWnaYIGFNOYj6yA<2UFl9gLOQrSGY2sPu6U-kA<3<0<0<0<After the renovation, I couldn`t wait to come back.  The inside decor is beautiful but I think they lost hot pot tables which means the line up is longer.  The new reservation is fast and efficient, they will notify you by the announcement in Mandarin and English.  I don`t like the hot pot table because they have individual plates or large plates.  Sometimes you are forced to share a pot instead of your own pot and share a table with another couple but they do have a cool divider to separate the table.  You don`t have a lot of room if you are sitting inside and you get the cool shelf to put your food on.  Last weekend I was sitting at a table with another couple, the controller is at the front of the table so I couldn`t control the temperature which is a pain.  The self-serve area, they used to have a lot more selections and you can add it to your own plate.  The self-serve area meat, seafood or veggies come in a square or cone shape box which is hard to carry.  Selections are a lot less.  No more free drinks like pop, soya drink and plum juice.  Why????  Also, they got rid of raw eggs and replaced them with quail eggs.  They added frog legs which are a specialty but not my favourite.  Same great service but now it`s like any other hot pot.  Very reasonable price but I missed the old self serve selections.  In the end, I asked for the bill and they told me to pay at the front counter.  I don`t even know my table number?  On my way out, they gave you a Melona bar to take home.  It`s a nice gesture but you can`t enjoy it sitting down.  I used to come often but with all the changes, I will give another Hot Pot place a chance.  Bring back the Free soya and plum drink, please.<12<11<2019<4<43<23

There isn`t much ambiance, but for the price you can`t beat it. Our server kept our drinks refilled and plates cleared. They have freshly carved turkey, ham, and prime rib. The mashed potatoes are real and there is stuffing for the turkey. I was surprised to see egg foo young on the buffet. There were breakfast options. The dessert area is large. The oatmeal cookie was my favorite item. They have soft serve ice cream machines.  There are no sugar added desserts. Soda comes with the meal. There was no line.

We settled on a selection of starters to share, oysters, swordfish ceviche and veal tartare. The swordfish was especially good. Two of us had the Lobster spaghetti which was delicious. My other friend had the pork chop. The restaurant was busy, buzzy and had a really nice atmosphere. Malcom was knowledgable and gave good wine recommendations. James - who I think was one of the owners was present in the restaurant making sure all the guests were happy, and he stopped by to chat.

Great food, vibes and people, it was only natural that I would choose snooze again to host my monthly Houston lash artist meet up, this time I chose Montrose location because it`s the middle spot for Houston basically. It was very packed and I liked that, meaning it had to be good. I waited for most of party to arrive before asking to get seated we were already (4) and I had told the hostess 5 Incase the last person was able to make it, while waiting to get seated the hostess came over and told us our 5 person was here just went back to the car. She never showed up, We got seated and out waiter seemed bothered by taking our orders, I asked for a macchiato and he quickly responded, '"this isn`t Starbucks, we don`t have macchiatos here'" ... well ok then... we place our order and he`s still acting bothered by us! We get our food pancakes and potatoes.. the food was good. As we are enjoying our meal and almost over with meeting and our food.. the manager comes over and tells us '" you can`t get seated until your whole party arrives, next time you won`t get seated until everyone is present'" umm.. that seemed kind of rude, considering she saw we were almost done eating, obviously the last person didn`t show up. We were only there for 45 minutes, normal I supposed not long enough for the manager to come and say something unesassary making it seem we were hogging the table, and our waiter just stopped checking on us all together. Really unprofessional from their part. Needles to say I definitely won`t be going back. I`m still trying to figure out why there were so packed, the food is good not great, and the service is horrible.

I`ve always waited for this place to open as I drove by it for my weekly Costco runs. Finally, they were.  Service: - Great service, entire staff welcomes you as you walk inside - Waters were always filled. This is a must with how necessary it is to cleanse your palate after each bite. - Best of all, they were patient with answering peanut allergy related questions and brought out fish sauce for my girlfriend to use for the summer rolls  Food: - Finally, some good pho in the North Las Vegas area - The other places have noodles that taste papery, dry and cheap - This place has noodles that are chewy, ricey, and delicious - The pho had generous portions of meat, and the herbs that it came with was fresh as well - The fried noodle bowl was great, but my only complaint was that it had imitation crab. I don`t remember if it was advertised as crab on the menu, but it didn`t matter much because it tasted good anyways  Bathroom was clean, which is rare among most pho restaurants.  If you`re in the local N. Las Vegas area and don`t want to make the drive to Chinatown for pho, give this place a try.<24<10<2019<6<13<21

The hotel lobby is colorfully and cheerfully decorated for the Christmas Holiday.  High Tea is served in both the elevated area of the beautiful lobby and in the Terrace Room itself.  My two star rating reflects my finding of the quality and selection of items offered for the $30 + tax + gratuity tea.  The first plate offered contained a thimble of pork pate inside a pastry cup, a  tiny salmon sandwich the size of a nickel, a cucumber and egg salad sandwich portion of which the bread was dry.  Following this offering came a three tiered tray.  The top tier pineapple, honeydew and cantaloupe melon, middle tier of  sweets of macron, truffles, a small cheese cake, chocolate trifle, a pastry cup with cream and strawberry, the lowest tier two scones no larger than a quarter.  I have enjoyed high tea in London, Ireland, Canada, through out the USA and on the high seas.  The Terrace Room high tea is deficient in savory items, the size of scones and excessive on sweets.   Service is good and the space between the tables abundant to afford private conversation. Tack on parking, cab or trolly charges and their High Tea becomes a pricy experience and not a good value for the food offerings.<5<12<2019<0<12<32

jPRzsxhNOcblRosRSvuSXw<moj7DUHkP4j9yfwFm-oOHQ<-9nai28tnoylwViuJVrYEQ<2<2<0<2<"Tapas Papa Frita has been around for a long time but apparently they have still not figured '"It'" out.  By '"It'", I mean how to please diners.  For example, the stage show (decent guitarist and good dancer) is presented in a remote corner of a large restaurant so that about one person out of ten gets a decent view.    For example, the music is rather loud so that the voices of dozens of patrons must be raised even louder to be heard.  The result is that it is so voluminous that you can`t really hear your partner and you can`t really enjoy the music.  You can`t hear your server very well either; maybe that`s why the service is so sparse, almost neglectful.  For example, half of the eight tapas we sampled were good to excellent, one was mediocre, and three were not worth eating.  But the entrees were worse - much worse.  The lamb ossobuco was not ossobuco, it was simply lamb shank, poorly braised and so tough that we needed a sharp knife to pry any meat off the bone (and we couldn`t get a sharp knife because our server was nowhere to be found).  Never mind; it`s taste was such that we didn`t want to eat it.  (By the way, the defining feature of ossobuco is that the lamb shank is cross-cut to reveal the bone marrow which is the real ace of the dish.  Here the shank was uncut and the marrow unreachable).  For example, the featured fish, Dorado (mahi mahi) was about the worst restaurant fish I have eaten.  First, the manchego crust was soggy to the point of being paste-like and very unappetizing.  Scraping it off, the fish had obviously been frozen (I hope) or very old, and had an off-putting flavor.  The rice mess underneath it was ruined by what was on top, and, well, you get the idea.  To be fair, the sangria and desserts were okay.  You may wonder why I didn`t give Tapas one star.  I generally reserve one star for restaurants that try to poison me, and I don`t think Tapas did it intentionally."<29<9<2019<15<3<25

But everything about the food was lackluster. Cauliflower appetizer had a slight peanut flavor but was mostly bland, and our two ramen bowls were not up to par. Dragon ramen had an undercooked egg compared to what is expected in Ramen, and mine was far too salty.

lEGArtmof1Gaz0QTU4KoKQ<PrPAKuxN2Aw_QL60DhALKQ<8Mj9EBSSg9X_Wnueus22aw<3<1<1<0<OVERALL: cool atmosphere with average food. Service was great.   I ordered the inferno ramen at Ki Ramen, and the first thing I`ll say is - don`t expect them to tone down the spice. I grew up eating spicy food, but even this made me sweat a bit. The taste of the ramen wasn`t terrific. I`d say it`s pretty average, but it wasn`t bad. There are definitely better ramen places in Pittsburgh though, but this place has its perks, such as really friendly service and a chill ambience.   What I will say though, is that they`re interesting with toppings. I had fried chicken skin in my ramen, and while it didn`t taste good, it was definitely innovative. If you come here, I would recommend the cauliflower appetizer. That was one of the best cauliflower dishes I`ve ever had! However, the consensus among my friends and I was that the ramen was at best a 3.5/5.   I would probably not come here again, but if I do, I wouldn`t mind too much. It`s decent - just not great compared to other ramen in Pittsburgh.<27<4<2018<22<36<57

He picked out a nice Pinot noir for me from California :) We both decided to do the filet combo meal. It comes with a salad and bread. We also ordered the garlic shrimp appetizer which was pretty good. Lots of cheese and garlic for sure! Then we both got the Caesar salads which was pretty good with these tiny coutons :)  The filet was the star of the meal for sure. The filet is wrapped in bacon and cooked a beautiful medium rare! Seasoned very well. For my side I got the twice baked potato which was creamy and had bacon bits and cheese in it. Yummmy! The other side was mushrooms/green beans and peppers. The veggies were fresh and delicious. After our lavish meal we still had room for dessert so I ordered the creme brulee. It was also good but some of the top was alittle burnt but I ate around it.

My lawyer advised me not to pay Firenza, but I did, just to get rid of this mess (which has been ongoing for almost 6 months). I have encouraged Firenza and give the money to charity, to avoid the bad karma they are likely to ensue, but I doubt that they will.

Vb_iCBFck0ZHcgLIcCgP4g<4K5HvzU-_QAxsuWG0nKlUQ<LrGj2VdmJVMthx7-eultjg<4<1<0<1<My friend who lives in the west end told me about Scotty Bons and I had to try it the same day cause how could I not know about a food spot in my own hood. Looking at the few photos online, since it`s still fairly new (they just celebrated their one year anniversary July 5), it all was very attractive already with the stand out decor and different offerings. Walking in, everything matched what I previewed and a likkle bit more.   The space is open and welcoming just like the service. Upon walking in, the 2 ladies at the counter acknowledged us while they were helping another customer and putting together take out orders which gave me a chance to check out the whole place including the menu.   The choices are simple but presented as a twist on what is usually available. For the commonly known dishes such as jerk chicken or curry goat, you can get it in a `bowl` or wrapped in a roti. The bowl option to me is a spin on the word used in salad shops but it just means the usual of rice & peas. Next on the menu are the sandwiches that I was looking forward to because there was seafood. Here is a breakdown of what I ordered:   Jerk chicken bowl - the chicken surprised me because it was flattened and boneless. I guess I`m a traditionalist and prefer jerk chicken to include skin and bones. The flavour was good though. Our server asked if we wanted veggies with it and of course we said yes. There was a generous portion of coleslaw that I found too creamy but that`s just my personal preference.   Curry goat roti - this had to be eaten with a knife and fork because the filling was just oozing out of the roti shell. A nice touch that they do here is putting the roti on the panini press so it`s not too mushy. I prefer Trini roti`s with dhal (split pea) crumbs everywhere. For the goat, I found it to be too `herbally` tasting but again that`s just me.  Cajun fish sandwich - this was made before the other 2 dishes so it sat for at least 5 minutes making it a bit mushy even though it was put on the panini grill. I didn`t find much of a Cajun or any flavour really on the fish so I probably wouldn`t order this again. Also, I wouldn`t ask for cheese as one of the toppings either since fish and cheese together can sometimes be weird.   Jerk shrimp sandwich - the shrimp was great, cooked well and great jerk taste. I enjoyed the lime sauce a lot! Another topping is corn salsa with pineapple which I`m not a fan of but only cause I don`t particularly like fruit, especially not mixed in with savoury food.   Everything was very fresh and made to order. There is limited seating with only 2 bar style `tables` (basically a chunk of a tree with the natural groove kept in which is cool) that equaled to about maybe 10-15 seats inside. 2 picnic tables were outside so that`s more seating when the weather is nice. I would definitely visit Scotty Bons again and recommend it to others. It`s always nice to find and support unique gems with good service in the GTA.<6<7<2019<12<24<21

It was just kinda.....bland. It was just there. Couldn`t taste the cheese, and the lobster/crab was woefully underseasoned. The fries weren`t cooked the best, and contrary to the sandwich, was oversalted.  Overall, not a good first impression.

9zr7ylLthnq1cLNXAcUK-A<Bv_niPt-fnfr-n_qIciCxA<A-UPD1aji1HP3e6uOmQGeA<1<6<0<0<"I wanted to give this place a fair chance, so I bought a 10-class pass and took a variety of classes that Y2 Yoga had to offer. After some reflection, I`ve come to the conclusion that this yoga studio is not for me. I`ve been doing yoga for many years, both in Austin and Houston, and found this place didn`t really vibe with the goals I had for my practice. See below:  The Good: 1. The studio offers a lot of classes throughout the day, which is great for people like me who cannot come until later in the evening due to my work schedule.  2. The studio is fairly large, with two stories, and three yoga rooms plus a massage room.  3. I like the changing/shower rooms. I especially appreciate that they offer tampons and hair ties in the women`s room.  The Bad: 1. While the studio is large, the yoga rooms are a bit small. This normally wouldn`t be a problem, but Y2 Yoga likes to cram people into these rooms like little sardines. This is an issue for me. It`s very hard to do poses without brushing up against someone and after 30 minutes the smell in the room gets a bit much to handle. I also find the amount of people they have in the room is a little dangerous, especially with the heated yoga classes. The room is already hot, but when you cram it so full of people, the temperature skyrockets. It becomes hard to breathe and I`ve gotten quite dizzy due to the amount of heat that accumulates in the class. Yoga should be relaxing, not a burning torture session. I recommend the yoga studio re-think the number of people they allow to register for a class, because as of this moment, it looks like they are worried about squeezing as much money out of a class as possible instead of their customers comfort level.  2. The music. Alright guys, we need to talk about the music at this studio because it`s a little ridiculous. When I come to yoga, I want to listen to relaxing music that helps me relieve stress and tension, not cause me anxiety. The music they play in class is usually a mix of some weird electro-dance music and crappy pop songs, all of which is really fast paced and played at an ear-splitting volume. Most of the time, I can barely hear the instructor because their silly dance music is eating through my eardrums. Turn it down. I didn`t come to cycling class, I came to yoga. I shouldn`t be getting hyped up in yoga class.  3. The pace. The pace is extremely fast, to the point that I can hardly ever keep up. By the time I`ve settled into one pose, I`m suddenly finding myself scrambling to get into the next pose. I find it extremely difficult to understand how these poses can be beneficial if you`re not given time to ease into them. I even tried the LDS class, and still found that class to be faster than I would like. I`ve never been to a yoga studio that had me falling all over myself trying to get into the poses. I get to the point where I just start doing my own thing because I get so stressed out and anxious. Again, I want my yoga practice to relax me and help me focus, not cause me anxiety. Y2 Yoga seems to focus more on cardio/fitness yoga than it does traditional yoga.  4. The poses. The poses are the same in almost every single class. It`s repetitive. Extremely. I`ve done more poses in one class back in Austin than I have done an entire month at Y2 Yoga. I don`t understand this at all. There are so many poses out there. Why don`t you ever change your classes up? I`m tired of doing the same thing over and over. And yes, they use the same poses in all their classes, regardless of what they title the class.  5. The instructors. I really dislike a lot of the instructors at this studio. Literally, all they do is walk around with a mic on and bark out yoga poses at lightening speed. They hardly ever demonstrate or do the yoga with you. Again, weird. I`ve been to many other studios where the instructor practices with the class, not walk around yelling out poses for an hour. I`ve also never had anyone correct my poses or help me out. Again, I understand it`s hard to give personal attention to everyone with the enormous amount of people you have in each class, but that furthers my belief that you need to start cutting down on class size. The experience here is very impersonal. I`ve also had an instructor call me out in front of everyone for leaving 15 minutes early. Excuse me? The reason I have to leave early, again, goes back to the fact that the class gets too hot and I start getting very dizzy towards the end and have to step out. I find it hypocritical that the instructors always say '"Listen to your body'" but then call you out when your body is telling you it`s about to pass out if you don`t get some fresh air. Not sure what`s up with that.  6. The front desk staff is, again, very impersonal. Never get a hello or goodbye.   **Owner slandered me and made fun of my review in class. Refused to apologize. Deleted all my FB posts regarding it. Beware.   SEE PHOTO OF INCIDENT."<13<5<2017<20<34<56

FvH0q3a9aV8yH-CT30YpyA<ihWqvIhIYXHOHHB-FYQdnw<Z87ulBDnosLf0yrMO3D-_A<1<1<0<0<So, here we go! okay, let me start by saying this review will most likely be added to and revised over the next few months because that`s how long i`ve been dealing with them due to the damage they caused to my dryer. I won`t use names but I am sure when the company reads this they will know exactly who I am.   2 May, 2019 I hired this company based on a referral from a friend. they showed up on time, and moved my furniture. The problem came when their moving crew dropped my dryer as they were carrying it down the stairs. They don`t use dolly`s or furniture straps to move furniture so i knew then this move might not go off without a hitch and when they dropped my dryer, my fears were confirmed. When they dropped it, the dryer hit the door jam which dented the front of the dryer. It also caused white paint to transfer onto the stainless steel finish of the dryer. The crew filled out a damage report, took pictures and told me this would be handled within 2-3 days. :-/   Mid-June, 2019 I am still dealing with them to either repair my dryer or pay me for the damage. A dryer that was 1 year old and cost me approximately 990.00, and their offer; $125.00. Keep in mind this dryer is brand new and I expect it to work for 10-15 years, and I would have to look at that damage for that entire time,and they feel $125.00 would be sufficient.   During the past 2 months I have had to send them numerous emails, text messages, pictures and all sorts of information which they should have already because their moving crew filled out the damage report on the day of the incident.   So, here we are. 2 months into this situation and still no closer to getting either my dryer repaired or compensated for their failure. Stay tuned; more to come.   6/21: Thank you Hannah. You are correct, we do have an agreement and i will update this review upon completion of our agreement. Thank you.<22<6<2019<5<3<38

I had the creamy chicken enchiladas and the small rolled enchiladas seemed as if it was one they had so little filling.  The beans and rice were modest portions as well and there was more plate showing than food covering.  The margaritas came in small half tumblers, which I thought was strange to serve a margarita in, but for $8 dollars each you would think it would be more than a few sips. The most disappointing item was the fried ice cream. I`ve grown up in Western New Mexico and Eastern Arizona where fried ice cream is a staple of every birthday and party.  They went too far overboard with this, with some sort of oatmeal??? At the bottom below the ice cream.  The sauces were more like a banana split, strawberry, chocolate, pineapple on the side.

HOWEVER, this time was actually decent! Had it not been for the bartender/waitress then I`m sure it would have Sucked as usual. Tika was working the bar area and I have to say, she was the BEST! Service was exceptional due to her overall positive attitude. She was very friendly and made the service great. Food was good. They have something called a quesadilla burger. If you`re sceptical about it like i was, dont be! It was actually really good! I have to say that this time around here again was A LOT better. Thank you!!<13<12<2018<2<16<4

We waited like over 45mins just to grab seats and order the food. And need to wait another 10-15mins for the food to be served... Overall I don`t think it was worth my time and energy! Which I can get this in Asia quite easily without any wait at all lol Short time wouldn`t go back to visit! :)  But if you are living in Toronto and never tried this type of '"dessert'" before(or never planning to go Asia to travel any sooner).

And since the demise of Rocky Montana, it`s the only place to get fruits and veg in the Girouard Park area. That said, it`s not a terrific grocery store. There are the occasional good deals. Look online at their circular, deals of the day on fruit and veg. They often have good sales on pasta and cereals. The set up of the store is off putting. You walk in to packaged meats....ugh! It would make more sense to put the meat at the back with the processed meat and the dairy and welcome customers with greens. The staff is, for the most part, surly. Don`t look for friendly faces. After a while you seek out the pleasant cashiers and you`ll wait in a longer line to interact with one. For better prices on '"healthy fare'" try Branche D`Olivier across the street. Almond and soy and coconut milks are less expensive, as are many flours and condiments....and all in a pristine environment. But for a quick pick up of pasta, or the mushrooms you need, or a couple of beers, Esposito is convenient. (There`s that word again!)"<29<7<2019<13<17<6
aLmfp6H2Fw3yeUkZGw9M9Q<6djZZa-GCQ-CsewwNpULpw<xyw1u6COx67m-XcHUccZPg<1<0<0<0<I have rented 6 apartments in the last decade, some on line and some with prior visit and have never been so deceived. I rented here because it is advertised to be a gated community with great amenities.  My list will describe my reality.  Upon entering the apartment, it was immediately noted that a drawer front was broken, A repair was made which failed minutes later.  1.     Upon arriving at the apartment building, Female tenant was verbally harassed / threatened by other tenants including one tenant asking her to reach into his pocket to get out a cigarette and light it for him.  2.     Other tenants approaching and asking to use her cell phone  3.     Security gate:                a.     propped open with a rock  b.     foot traffic gates and car traffic gates are always open  4.  The air in the apartment cause tenant to have an asthma attack on her first night requiring her to go to an urgent care for a Nebulizer treatment.  The carpets are dirty.  6. A puddle in the bathroom floor was noticed immediately.  Although maintenance was called - no action (other than a visit from an individual with no ID or uniform) telling tenant that they have to get a new part.  7..     The lights in the kitchen are bare bulbs - no coverings.  8.     Electrical outlet in living room does not work`  9.     Carpet tacks in both rooms - along every seam are exposed and dangerous  10.     All interior door handles (except Bedroom 2) are installed backwards  11.     Door to Bedroom 1 does not close (is installed incorrectly)  12.  NONE of the windows have screens  13.  Door knob on front door is loose  14.  There is no lock on the doorknob  15.  NO blind in Bedroom 1 - exposing it to street view  16.  Gap in blind in bedroom 2 also exposing it to the street  17.  Bright orange eviction notice on neighboring window detracts from safety.  I lost a lot of money in move in costs and hospital bills. Stay away.<6<12<2019<3<51<32

qOdJwB6YRD-kZMwDIC_hxQ<RJ-2sKDw54poPnEz6xrIaw<3AVDL6wjEnicjgSSgRiSXQ<5<0<0<0<Chris has fantastic work ethic and knowledge when it comes to plumbing.  I`ve had three plumbers visit my homes in the past, from the guaranteed $X amount for any rooting/plumbing service to the expensive 2-4 person man jobs to clear any issue.  The issue this time was that my laundry room was flooding whenever the washer machine would drain and empty into its respective drainage pipe. He originally diagnosed the issue as a bowed/curved pipe underneath my bedroom which was causing a sludge of backup to not flow into the main sewage line outside. After clearing it out, I hoped for a resolution to the issue, but unfortunately the laundry room still flooded. Without any hesitation, I contacted Chris and he immediately booked me for his next appointment the next morning for no extra cost.  The actual issue in this case was a backup of grease, food, and debris that has been accumulating inside the pipes around my kitchen sink. As such, this was stopping the water to flow correctly from the laundry room into the main sewage line. After clearing this out, he recommended me some preventative measures and now my washer is no longer flooding the room.  I filled out several requests for quotes online and Chris was definitely the best price for the service and with the end result and knowledge I now know, I am definitely going to be calling him and recommending him for future jobs !!<28<8<2019<18<16<23

The decor was nice as well, but the room was freezing and it was uncomfortable to eat while being cold. However, it tends to be the thing in a casino.  My issues arouse from the food itself. My friend and I decided to go big and get the Omakase for $125 per person at 5-6 courses. The food was just '"meh.'" The Uni Risotto was strangely bland and the weird; breaded Wagyu beef dish was just...well, weird. I took a couple bites and couldn`t eat anymore. Made me sad that the meat was prepared in this way.   The sushi was pretty good, but not exceptional. And when I went back to my room at my hotel later that night, I became quite ill. Being that I only shared 1 carafe of sake with my friend and had nothing else to eat since breakfast- I feel positive my upset stomach was due to the meal I ate at Mizumi.   Pretty much the last thing anyone needs is to become ill while on a trip, and being that the food was average and overpriced- and most likely the culprit of my agony at 2 in the morning- I would suggest steering clear."<10<10<2017<19<34<36

There`s a massive parking lot surrounding this taco joint, so you have to drive around to find it. I didn`t go inside so I don`t know what it`s like. The drive thru servers were not pleasant; they almost sounded bitter at life.   On Wednesday`s, they have $1.99 shrimp and fish tacos, so I tried one of each. Both were delicious. My only suggestion would be to give a tad bit more meat, or make smaller tortillas. The tacos are served on double tortillas, and I found that eating the taco with just one layer was great.   I tried both red and green salsa and decided both are necessary for the fish taco. The shrimp taco is full of flavor by itself already. I would have liked some lemon sprinkled on top but forgot to ask since I was in the drive thru.   I gotta try their other daily deals next time!<9<10<2019<19<37<1

What an awesome place. There was eight of us and they sat us on the patio which felt more intimate to our big group.  Our waitress JAMIE/JAIME was AMAZING! All our drinks came out quick and very delicious. Enough so that once happy hour ended it didn`t stop us from ordering more. The food was delicious. Much better than I expected and I found myself craving it again this morning. Jaime/Jamie was very personable and took our jokes and wild laughter in and was able to fit right in with our vibe ! It was a great experience and most us agree we will definitely be back    I brought my husband back about a week later and was beyond happy that the quality of service and FOOD (most important to me) was exactly the way I remembered. Raving about this place and getting my husband to try it and then he LOVED it too (so rare I can not even explain) he then went to tell our friends about the platinum tacos!

We supposedly got an updated/upgraded room, but our restroom shower is missing tiles from the bottom of the shower (see photo), our carpet was so dirty, it made our feet grey from dirt (see photo) in which my sister had worse since hers was basically black as I later resorted to wearing socks, our AC started leaking a steady flow of water that we had to use a trash can to catch water with which was eventually fixed by their maintenance team who was very good and nice, & the tv reception is so god awful, I can only watch commercials in their entirety if I`m lucky while the shows just keep skipping and freezing (see photo). The sofa couch is so terribly thin and unsupportive that my back was hurting and aching in the mornings.   The only good things I can say are this: the smell of lobby is great, nice front desk workers and maintenance and housekeeping, the room itself is nice and big and has a nice kitchen area to cook and do things and the kiddie pool. Oh and the jacuzzi bath tub but after the first night of having our feet turn black, i refuse to use the tub again. With the floor being so dirty, lord knows what else isn`t cleaned properly!

So rude and judging its crazy how a business can make paying customers feel like they shouldn`t have walked into their workplace, my friend came in to say hi quickly while I was eating and the waitress threatened to kick her out because she wasn`t paying for all you can eat(she didn`t want to eat...) and the whole time kept staring at us making us feel so uncomfortable I didn`t even want to eat! I wish I got her name because if I treated customers like that at my workplace I would be written up instantly or even fired. So disappointing to see great food not being enjoyed because of the customer service!

Their dinner menu seems to get a lot of flack? But I have no idea what that`s about. All I know is that I`ve gone to their brunch buffet numerous times and it`s never failed me. I truly believe that it is the best buffet for its price on the Strip. It has amazing variety, the quality is decent, and the service and cleanliness is great.  I think some people write reviews without having a realistic view on things? But I think when you take the buffet for what it is, which is a buffet- that`s churning out loads of unlimited food for you, it really is such a great choice. Definitely recommend it!  Tip: the breakfast pizza at the brunch buffet is super delicious! And the shiumai is surprisingly on point too~<18<10<2019<2<18<45

I was intrigued by the variety of flavors they had but did not get a chance to taste any, as I`m watching my sugar intake (pre-diabetic.) If they had sugar free options, I would have :-).    My family got:  1) Ube shake - with hard ice cream & boba 2) Pineapple & Lychee shake - with hard ice cream, no boba.   Here you have the choice of using hard ice cream or soft serve with your shakes and smoothies.   My family said the shakes were sweeter than other places but they still liked it.   The service was friendly and attentive by both individuals (one I`m assuming is the owner.) We will be back. I may try their halo-halo and Ube soft serve as it seems to be popular picks here.   TIPS:  1) Tuesday and Thursday BOGO free offer is only for the soft serve, not hard ice cream.   2) There is a price difference between the soft serve and hard ice cream shakes. Not by much, just an FYI ;-).   3) In the Goodwill & Dollar Tree shopping plaza. Limited seating, about 3 small tables, 6 chairs inside.  2018 Yelp Challenge Review #5<22<10<2018<3<33<55

He appreciated our patience so much so, he offered to give us a gift certificate to a local restaurant that we like.  We were happy with the results until he failed to return our calls.  We needed electrical work, repairs to cracked tiles, hardwood flooring was not stained correctly, re-cauking of the bathroom tiles.  Gary came over to assess all the fixes, and said his team would be here by a date.  I emailed him the day before to confirm and he said the tile was not available.  So we postponed and we offered another day which he confirmed.  I took off from work to wait for him and get all the repairs done.  This was back in May.  It is July and Gary has not responded to any of my emails and does not answer my phone calls.  We have given Gary the benefit of the doubt too many times.<1<7<2019<23<23<26

I ordered the spicy passonfruit margarita- highly recommend. It was refreshing and made for a perfect cocktail.   Onto the main show. The menu all sounds amazing and I fondly remember the lettuce wraps but I opted for the Tuna salad. SO good! Everything from the ingredients to the yummy dressing.

The first was our A/C going out in the middle of July. It took 11 days for them to replace it. 11 days is unacceptable in Las Vegas. In the meantime, they offered to let us borrow a window A/C unit, but did not offer to put us up in a hotel or any sort of compensation, or even apology, for the extremely delayed work order.  We also had our sprinkler system leaking, so much so that our water bill was outrageous. They sent someone out to '"fix'" it, only to find they turned off our sprinkler system completely without fixing it. It took us several weeks to realize our sprinklers weren`t coming on early in the morning any longer. By that time, most of the plants were on the verge of dying. We bought a hose to manually water the plants, but the damage was already done. We put in another work order and never heard back. I guess they didn`t care about the dead plants.  When it came time for us to move out, we put in our request through the tenant portal 30 days in advance of our move out date. After two weeks without any sort of reply or response in regards to our move out, we called to inquire about the move out process and checklist. They said they could not access the patient portal to see our move out request. However, we pay our rent and put in work orders through this same portal, and they never seem to have trouble accessing it. After several phone calls and back and forth conversations being transferred to multiple people, they magically found our request. We were then transferred to two more people before we could get specific move out instructions. It was exhausting. We were just trying to be good tenants. Once they found our move out request, they immediately gave out our phone numbers for realtors to contact us about showing the house. We were responsible for setting up these appointments and being home for the realtors to come by. We had realtors from Costello showing up with multiple clients at the same time (awkward), and several with no notice at all. It was an utter nightmare.  We received our final deposit back (and it wasn`t the full amount) after 37 days, which is in violation of the law in Nevada. That was after contacting them multiple times. We would take them to court, but are honestly too exhausted to deal with them yet again.

elowt9mqPcUrXivTzNoYaA<dqKGX-Zz61Cz62S86mHNmg<0gOE-DJOhWavRI6qQryGhA<3<0<0<0<We met some friends here on Sunday for a meal. We ended up sitting in the dining room side.  Pretty cool old Victorian place turned into a restaurant/pub.  They had a lot of nice Gastro beers on tap and a reasonable amount of wines as well on offer     On Sundays they serve their prime rib, with a huge Yorkshire pudding and gravy and the Fixin`s. Yeah that`s the thing to order. But to make sure you`re hungry. I ended up actually taking part of my meal home. They give you 10 ounce of prime rib with a really big Yorkshire pudding, vegetables, mashed potatoes and a little gravy boat. It`s a lot of eating but it was really good. We really enjoyed it and we also that we would come back.  The only thing that was a slight downside is that a very loud large table of about 10 people came in and made it really difficult to hear each other.   I get that and some of these locations it`s hard to manage noise. But they were really quite obnoxious. And part of it might`ve been about the old building thing and that noises tend to really resonate. Regardless of that we would give it a spin again. So if you`re looking for a good roast beef dinner on a Sunday, look no further this is the place. It`s not a huge spot so I do recommend making a reservation. I bet it really fills up. We had gone early so it wasn`t too bad at all but by the time we left it was pretty full.<9<11<2019<20<57<29

This time I dined solo and sat at the bar with Melissa(Awesome customer service and very attentive) as my bartender/server. Of course I ordered my favorite taco, '"Baja Fish'" and tried a new one '"Crunchy Chicken'" with a side of corn salad($2). I love the baja fish taco but always like trying a new taco each time I go. The crunchy chicken was really good and super filling. Its loaded with mashed potatoes, cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, special dressing and shredded chicken.  Corn salad is very `rich` and a looks like a small portion, but I couldnt finish it! Also, had my favorite drink '"El Pepino'" which is refreshing and delicious. Im super full! If dining solo be careful not to order too much because the tacos are huge and loaded to the brink!  Lots of tv`s with all the sports going on, very lively establishment.

We refused and instructed him to counter. He reluctantly did what we asked and we were able to get our asking counter offer. (no thanks to him) I thought realtors were trained to negotiate....It was very clear early on that he was not interested in doing what was in our best interest on the sale of our home. During our new home construction, he was completely absent. We just closed on 11/8 on our new construction home and we have not received any correspondence from him. Our home took seven months to build and during that time, he never reached out to us once to just touch base. He never took the time to call/text/email to say '"congratulation'" on either transaction. We only went with him because of the great reviews that was posted.

When I first heard of this place, I thought this would be another dessert place that has crappy food but baits people for their pretty-looking food/corner of their interior. But to my surprise, Cafe Bora`s dessert was not only tasty but healthy as well.   They`re well known for their purple (Bora in korean, hence the name of the cafe) dessert, that gets this colour from the purple sweet potato. Knowing this, my friend and I ordered a purple shaved ice. The size of shaved ice wasn`t as gigantic as your typical asian shaved ice places, but the quality for sure was a lot better. Instead of the shaved ice just being sweet and tasting like sugar or artificial flavours, it wasn`t too sweet and tasted like sweet potato. I was very impressed how they pulled this taste out and made it go well with shaved ice.   On top of the shaved ice, it came with three sweet potato and walnut chips, condensed milk and purple sweet purée in very pretty receptacles.   The price is not super cheap, but given that it`s located in Yorkville, and the quality is actually pretty good, I think if was worth it.<26<9<2019<1<43<23

Only until recently did I figure out which family member belonged to what kind of burger - until I got the grandpa burger and saw the massive 3 patty burger. So, the older and fragile you are, the more you eat?  Okay then.   They should consider putting lettuce in all their family member though, as mine only had ketchup and mayo, with a sliver of pickle.   The onion rings I find are so damn salty, yet I continue to order them. Sodium overload for sure - they need to consider cutting it down for those waist conscious people (aka, not me)  This place seems to give regular coupons, but at times, the store will have a better price than the coupon itself. Marketing fail.   Overall, I love this place - and you should, too<6<12<2013<20<10<2

We just closed on a house in which he was the listing agent and it was an absolutely horrific experience. This evening, hours after receiving the keys to our new home, we realized that Phil, his team, and sellers broke a legal contract by allowing the sellers to remove light fixtures from the outside of the home that were clearly and explicitly outlined in the contract. This was really the tip of the iceberg of our completely unprofessional experience with Phil and his team. While Phil might be great if you are trying to sell, it you are interested in a home he is selling I would strongly advise you look for another home as he sets no boundaries with his sellers or limits about what should remain in the house. In addition, he allows sellers to leave their homes dirty and not remove trash from their properties.<16<11<2019<1<56<4

Hmmmmm.... I wonder if there`s a connection....  Meanwhile, quality and quantity of ingredients has declined substantially.  What was once my favorite place to grab a sandwich isn`t even on my list anymore.  Kinda sad.  I wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewer who complained about the avocado.  The most insulting part of it is that they charge something ridiculous like $1.00 (a huge amount when compared to the total cost of the sandwich) to add extra avocado.  In my experience, even if you pay for extra, there`s still not enough on there to actually taste it.  Paradiso is located in the same building as the JJ`s on Lincoln, and is a MUCH better sandwich for about the same price.  I`d recommend going there instead.<15<6<2008<4<41<1

I`ve been here five times, and never have I had a bad experience. Superb timing on my part, I suppose.   If anything my only grievances are as follows: this is the only Nespresso in town. Chandler doesn`t have one apparently, and Tempe certainly does not. Fine, but of all the locations for this Boutique to be located, Fashion Square is a hassle to visit -- that is, unless you arrive as early as I did today.   On Sundays, Nespresso Boutique opens at 11 A.M. Otherwise it`s 10 A.M. for the rest of the week. I arrived about 3 minutes before opening to find a small queue of eager shoppers.   When the doors opened, I made a beeline for the tasting counter, where a friendly staff member prepared a Cinnamon coffee from their new seasonal styles. I thought it was excellent, so I added it to my shopping list for this morning, in addition to a couple sleeves of Stormio and Alto Dolce.   The cashier who prepared my order was amiable and answered my questions about my Nespresso account. He also suggested making online purchases through the Nespresso website versus Amazon (seeing as I buy almost everything from Amazon), if only for the possibility of free capsules and other little membership perks. Not a bad idea, plus I appreciate his not shooing me out of the store for entertaining a third-party vendor.   And so, with a fancy paper bag of expensive coffee, off I went! I was in and out in less than ten minutes. I like this shop, decorated with its many kinds of coffee makers, colorful capsules, and the aroma of freshly brewed Nespresso. I certainly hope you do too, and not just because there is no alternative store in the Valley. Do check it out; at least grab a cup of coffee while you`re there.   Am I in any logical, financial position to be a Nespresso regular? Probably not. But damn... that is some excellent coffee.<28<10<2019<18<30<6

However, I would rather come here with him so he can do all of the talking, lol.  We brought his mom to this store when she was visiting, and I swear, she could live here. We were here for an hour and I know we could have been here longer, but we had to tell her we had to get going due to prior engagements. I am glad that she loved this store, though.  One of my favorite sections is the bakery. Their pastries and breads are very fresh and taste so good. Also, where they sell their cooked foods is another section we love. Their carnitas, tilapia, rice and beans are what we like to buy and they all taste very good.  One of the reasons why we don`t need give this place 5 stars is that it could be cleaner.

Yv7RVeqqQKGRR_eL_a2b0A<smoPqnOHDy8tWjAiTaQMlQ<5blQIaqSrpk5j0mxO26nEg<1<13<2<0<A little over a year ago I had Jim Brown and Sons Roofing Company come over to give me an estimate on replacing some cracked and broken clay tiles on the roof. When the estimator came over she suggested to also have the flat roof resealed. I have signed the contract with them for the suggested work and they came over and according to them completed the job, i.e. replace the roof tiles and seal the all the flat roof portions. I have paid them when they said they completed the job.  However, a few months ago I was walking around the house and have observed that that the roof tile they were replacing above the garage door did not have mortar in between like the rest of them. I have called them to come back and to give me an estimate on replacing some other cracked tile. When the estimator came over he checked the roof and he asked who did the work before. I told them that it was them and he said that they did not complete everything but they will come over and complete it because it was still within one year warranty period.  When the second person from Jim Brown arrived he went on the roof and said that he cannot do it because he did not have the proper equipment. At that point I have climbed up the roof and checked it myself and have almost felt off the leather because all the tiles were randomly scattered on the roof. It took seven visits from the company to finally finish the job that I have paid them to do. And that was because the house was for sale and when the home inspector pointed out that some of the flat portions of the roof were not even sealed. Most of their roofers were not competent or they were just trying to take an advantage of me for not climbing on the roof and checking their work when they have said they have completed it.<19<1<2015<3<57<28

Located in a strip mall this place looks pretty boring from the outside .. but the food and the spacious interior space did not disappoint.  We were greeted and seated right away.. lengthy menu so we started with egg rolls so we could decide on entrees .. curry, pad Thai, papaya salad, soup, dumplings, fried shrimp ..  chicken, beef, pork, shrimp .. spicy or burn your mouth hot.. so hard to decide  I went with the pineapple curry with chicken (new flavor combo for me!).. heat 3 on a 1-5 scale was perfect .. served with fluffy jasmine rice.. it was delicious, coconut, chunks of veggies, chicken & pineapple..  The bf decided on the spicy fried rice with pork because  he loves fried rice .. heat 3 out of five also .. this was also delicious.. full of carrot rings (not mushy) and sliced pork ..   Even though we were full we decided to split a dessert and omg the fried bananas with coconut ice cream with the caramel drizzle was amazing ... warm bananas with cold ice cream .. perfect ending or beginning to any meal.  I would recommend this place for a delicious Thai meal .. fast service<4<8<2019<2<22<22

May was our waitress and super knowledgeable about the menu and personable! We split the benny duo with the chile Verde (added Barbacoa on top per May`s recommendation) and the benny goodman. Both were amazing! Side of bacon is a must! And my most favorite thing... drumroll please... OMG French toast! The name was obvious after the first bite- definitely the best I`ve ever had!   They serve Boomtown coffee -- delish! Unfortunately didn`t have any of the craft cocktails/coffees because we ate at 9 am on a Sunday.

I think the longest I`ve waited was about an hour and a half. If you decide to go, go earlier in the morning. Parking is small so you have to find neighborhood parking or street parking. I always get the egg benedict and there`s a mix and match option for you to choose two kinds in case you can`t decide which ones (called the benny duo).

No prob, put your name/number down and go down a couple blocks for siphon coffee while you wait. You`ll get a text when you`re ready to be seated. Win win.  The service was great and food was outstanding. We ordered various dishes and each one was thoroughly enjoyed. I had the barbacoa chile verde eggs benedict and the frittata. Both were delicious, but if I had to pick, I`d go with the frittata since it is lighter on the palate and stomach.   The place is child-friendly, but I don`t know how much they would enjoy the dishes, save for the simple things like pancakes and waffles.

As I have lived here since 1971. I went for my  '"FREE'" consultation on a Saturday. I called the following Monday to give a retainer for the services, paid over the phone with my card. That Wednesday I decided I was not going to used his services after all. I call the office and '"MIKE'" answers,  I explain I would like to cancel and would like my deposit back. He said '" Oh we dont do that, its non refundable.'" I said  '"Your office did not do anything, so why is non refundable?'" Mike explained '" I will speak to someone and get back to you '". Did not hear back from them, so I called again and got MIKE! I stated who I was, and was calling back to see about my refund, again he said they do not refund the retainer, it says that on the agreement I signed. I proceeded to tell him I did not sign any agreement, he said I did when I gave my payment over the phone. I again explained I was not aware of any agreement. Mike then proceeded to say how rude I was and he kept talking when I was trying to talk. I never raised my voice just wanted to understand why they would keep my money. I then asked to speak with office manger and Mike said I did not need to speak with her, I then asked what her name was and he stated I did not need to know that, she does not have a name. So as he was speaking to the office manager, thinking he had the phone covered so i couldnt hear, I could hear and heard him call her Alice, i think. Then MIKE gets back on the phone and says they will speak with Frank Sorrentino on Thursday and get back to me. I also heard MIKE say that '" oh this is a newbie'". So I said  '" ok I will call on Thursday, MIKE hung up on me. So its now Friday and I have not heard anything back from them. I decide I will call them on Monday. I go and check my mail on Saturday and there is a check with the amount of my retainer fully refunded and a copy of the agreement I NEVER signed. All ended well, but to be treated like that was unacceptable and undeserved. I hope that Frank Sorrention knows what kind of staff he has and how they treat his potential clients.

Everything was great until about 1 month in, and the control panel on the steering wheel stopped working. Then the face panel then came loose,  and then the side plastic covering came off shortly thereafter. I normally try and solve quality issues through speaking directly with the company - and that`s exactly what I did. I spoke with the owner directly several times, over a long period of time to get this resolved, and he repeatedly told me that he didn`t have a fix. He essentially forced me to take my money elsewhere to get better service. The part itself worked fine. It was specifically the installation and poor follow-up service that warranted this poor rating.   The overall level of professionalism for this company is reflected by the owner. If you`re not a discerning customer and don`t mind poor service, you would probably be satisfied. Otherwise, I wouldn`t recommend it.<13<7<2016<16<9<51

I watched cocktail waitresses stand in there station at the bar and bullshit with each other for 25 minutes straight so I couldn`t get a drink. So then I went to the bar I finally got a drink and tipped 2 dollars for the drink bartender took the tip didn`t acknowledge me didn`t say thank you nothing I was ignored the entire time at the bar then at the sports deli it took 1 hour to get a French dip sandwich.

I do not like the near-deafness I was threatened with just for going to the restroom (more on that later). I do not like the horrendously bad service.   Food It sucks. It fucking sucks! One-star level of food here, no hyperbole. (Well, maybe a little.)  Now, I am no goddamn expert on barbecue (I have only made pilgrimages to Austin, KC, Memphis, and Nashville for barbacoa though, and actually saw firsthand how all originally derived in a Taíno reserve), but what I have been served here at Lucille`s was simply not good food.   Did not taste good, did not look good; made me want to strive to become vegan. If I were forced to eat all of my meat exclusively from Lucille`s, or of a Lucille-like quality, I would become vegan. No bullshit. I would basically become Morrissey.   Service The one waiter we had did not (a) know what was it that came with the largest pre-packaged combo on their own menu -- like no shit ... had no clue at all -- ; and (b) did not bring everything that was supposed to come with the combo from their very own menu after studying it at fucking length! Sucks.  Ambiance I have been to Heavy Metal concerts that were kinder to my hearing. And I have also been to private invite events at Wynn fucking Resorts that had less pretentious yuppies than Lucille`s in The District at GVR, Henderson, NV, U.S.A..   Dude, turn down the fucking volumes on those goddamn amps in the bar; this is not an arena or Lollapalooza. It is a fucking restaurant!  Epilogue Overpriced. And it sucks. The holy duo for I-won`t-be-caught-dead-in-this-shithole-again for me. That is just me; this might be the greatest eats you have ever had in your life for you though. We are all different, after all. - E  Postscript.

Didn`t expect italian when we ordered two bean burritos` that were served filled with a small amount of watery beans, and swimming in what smelled and looked like marinara or speggitti sauce! There was actual italian seasoning on our bean burritos.  We were really hungry, so we ordered the cheese dip to go along with basket of chips (which were stale btw)...The cheese dip was the texture and appearance of a high fructose corn syrup laced salad dressing, which tasted absolutely fake!

NvYS0xPX-vd1jFVYjUkroQ<F78tJHr0qW6FsYBtWMmLpA<aEL5t0JAArsrt6SonM5PRg<3<7<5<5<This review is primarily based on my recent flight with Hawaiian Airlines via their first-class service.  Starting with check-in at the airport (PHX), staff were pleasant the morning of our flight and assisted us with the check-in process via one of the many available check-in kiosks, in addition to taking our checked luggage (no cost with the first-class service which was a plus).  We were checked in via the kiosks as there were some folks already in the first-class line.  After clearing the TSA checkpoints, we assembled by the gate and enjoyed the little time we had looking around the terminal.  There were many areas you could sit, away from the crowds assembled by the gate, that afforded you some peace and quiet if that`s what you`re looking for.  The terminal also had many available bathrooms, a Starbucks coffeeshop, and a magazine shop (maybe a couple of those) as well.  For boarding call, I found the process to be a little daunting considering we were in first-class.  The boarding call was similar to that of Southwest in that the gate agent would announce that they are now boarding and doing so by zones, e.g. zone 1 would board first, then zone 2, etc.  Well, with that process, we found that everyone got up and started making a line so it was difficult to differentiate who was in zone 1 or 2 and so forth, and the gate agent didn`t make the process any easier (-1).  This to me felt a bit disorganized.  As we boarded, we were greeted with lots of warm welcomes and smiles by the flight attendants and shown our seats.  At this point, I must say that the first-class option/ticket is absolutely worth it based on the amount of space you`re given especially their 180-degree-lie-flat seats especially on a 6-hour flight to Hawaii.  Overhead bin storage was plentiful since it was all primarily reserved for first-class customers.  Pre-takeoff, you`re offered a drink of either a Mai Tai or a guava drink (or water).  I`m not sure if there were other options but that was presented to us.  I opted for the Mai Tai and it was good though, for me, a bit on the strong side.  The completion of boarding went by in no time, and before you know it, we were pushing back.  Our flight left on time as scheduled with no delays.  Once up in the air, they offer more drinks and a bowl of macadamia nuts before the first course of the meal.  The first course of the meal consisted of a croissant with butter or jam and fresh fruit.  The main course meal thereafter consisted of an omelette with cartelized onions, mushrooms and a sausage.  Then dessert is a mango panna cotta.  My only issue with the meal or rather Hawaiian Airlines meal service as it pertains to the first-class is the lack of variety or options, e.g. no vegan/vegetarian options or gluten-free or kosher (-1).  Before you`re about to land, they do offer you a bag of onion chips and more Mai Tai cocktails.  Even throughout the flight, you`re well taken care of with an attentive crew of flight attendants that are always around or within reach at any time.  And, what`s also nifty is that throughout the flight, all first-class customers are provided with their own individual iPads (on loan from the airline) with headsets (also on loan).  The iPads had a decent variety of TV shows and movies to choose from including a section for games and music as well.  There were many movies I hadn`t watched so I didn`t have to take out/use my own iPad with movies.  Overall, the flight was smooth and not bumpy or turbulent and went by like nothing considering all at the available amenities and luxuries that one has at their disposal in the first-class cabin. My recommendation and if you can afford it, treat yourself to the first-class experience if/when you`re flying on Hawaiian Airlines as you won`t regret it!<11<11<2019<0<13<2

I ordered 3 street tacos at the drive thru and I changed my mind at the window and asked to take one taco off. I didn`t think it would be a big deal and the lady looked at me with a rude look and walked off without saying anything! She went and yelled out to the cook to take off one taco as if it was the biggest inconvenience. I asked if it was a problem, if so I`ll just keep the taco. She took my payment and didn`t say anything else. I waited and when I got my food, the carne asada was hard as a rock and the meat was so tough I didn`t even take a bite. I went inside for a refund and didn`t even get so much as an apology. She rolled her eyes and gave me my money back.

Server did offer me dessert but didn`t have time for it. I went to Ricarda`s on a Tuesday noon (October 15), booked a table for 2 at 12:30pm. I got seated right away, in a bit squeezed table with full tables on all 3 sides of us (the other side is the wall, we didn`t have window table) when there were a lot of other empty tables around. I`m ok with that.  The server came around, I ordered Pan-seared Scallops and my coworker ordered Lamb Burger. It took awhile for the food to come out, my coworker got his lamb burger, but I got halibut & octopus - wrong order there. The server apologized, I only have 1 hour lunch and in a rush, so I accept the halibut & octopus without asking to switch to my scallop order. I said I ordered the last item in the Lunch menu, the server said halibut was the last item in the main menu, so she got it wrong.  The food was good, my coworker seemed to like his burger, my halibut and octopus were also decent. I asked for the bill and the server asked if we wanted dessert as her treat, but we were in a rush for meeting at 1:30pm so we declined. I got the bill and got charged for the halibut, which was $5 more than the scallops I supposed to get.  As the wrong order was the server`s mistake, I think I should get charged for the price of the scallops, not the halibut. If only I had more time for the restaurant to make me the right order (and charge me for it, obviously), or have more time for the dessert, things could have been better. However, I did not expect to plan time for wrong order or dessert.  The 3 stars are for the interior design and the quality of food. If you`re a food reviewer, choose a table near window and you`ll have pretty photos for sure. Not sure about great services though.<15<10<2019<23<32<31

Upon asking to speak to a manager we were told they were able to find another chair, which we no longer needed, but still decided to get our checks and take our party elsewhere. It`s a shame that a party of 12 who was ordering food and multiple bottles of wine couldn`t be accommodated. I will not be dining at this location again with a group or otherwise.

I was born and raised in Puerto Rico so Im always a little nervous of trying Puerto Rican food outside PR because mostly I just don`t wanna be disappointed. This guys DO NOT disappoint. I had the tostones (fried green plantains) with carne fria (fried pork) and of course mayoketchup ( a mayo and ketchup sauce with other seasoning to dip your tostones or fries). The tostones were freshly fried and the carne frita had a great flavor! Very well seasoned. I also had a tripleta (3 meat sandwich) to go... because I can. The tripleta was HUGE and although a little less tasty that those found home it still hit the spot. Price wise for the amount of food you get it is really affordable... we all had left overs! I was sad they had run out of mofongo (fried green plantains mashed and dome shaped) just before we got there (11:30pm ish) . I would recommend going early because they do routinely run out (that tells you how good they are!). They also have dessert ( flan), pastelillos (similar to empanadas) and drinks that take you back to the island (malta, coco rico, uvita). And the guys who run it are just so nice too! Always a plus! Obviously will go back again (early this time) and will likely buy multiple things again<3<12<2019<4<52<9

No one ever knows anything, and you get the run around from everyone. My mother has been here since last Friday, September 6 - and they have YET to take her to the actual gym for exercises. They do not turn her over, which if they do not, she can develop bed sores/ulcers. We always have to tell them to turn her on her side.  Call light will be on for 20..30...40..minutes before anyone comes in, and if they do, they will say '"oh that is the RN, I will let her/him know'". That turns into another 20...30..40.. All for them to not end up knowing the answer.  Everyone always seems bothered when you ask questions or tell them about your comments/concerns. Also, it seems like you always have to ASK for them to give her a bed bath. Are you kidding? That is something that is necessary. HYGIENE. They just mediocrely do their job and leave. They don`t want to have to deal with the hassle of changing bed sheets, sitting people up in wheel chairs, chairs, etc.  The first night/first day she was here, we had to explain approximately 4-5 times of what happened to her. I expect for the nurses to have already read her chart, and know exactly why she is in here. Also, '"oh I don`t know I just clocked in'", is NOT an appropriate answer.  Also, her feeding vessel was empty for about 2 hours before anyone came to change it out - we asked multiple times, and multiple different people. Nothing.  We have also asked for a full report on her time here, and have yet to receive it - it has been three days.  It seems as if there are no family members with her- they will not do anything, or tend to her.  Please do NOT take your loved ones here."<14<9<2019<2<53<27

I think he could run his own pool business and make a fortune just from his knowledge and fantastic attitude/personality alone. As long as Brian works there, we will be faithful customers.  :)<4<5<2014<18<55<14

Bill showed me what they had, and I found one that I thought my fiancé would love. This was my first stop, and being a responsible consumer, I went to 5 or 6 other jewelers that day to see what what else was out there. Nothing compared to Desert Diamond and the experience I had with Bill, both in terms of a quality selection in line with what I was after, and the costumer service offered by Bill. I went back and purchased the ring and a different diamond after some education. They resized the ring, placed the new diamond, and shipped the ring across the country in time for me to propose the next weekend. I will definitely be going back there to get the matching band here shortly. Overall wonderful experience. Buying an engagement ring and proposing are daunting prospects, fellas, but this experience made it much easier and I left with peace of mind.<9<12<2019<19<55<51
YqGmd5OhZkZAcURlhgKRdw<zckLu2_HoG2UmmQzC52AZw<4QIpOUetqRefQ3HGfdIQoA<5<1<1<1<"I saw Brassica while scrolling through Yelp`s list of Cleveland restaurants, and honestly what drew me into Brassica from this list was its pretty pictures... especially the stuffed Pitas in the metal cylindrical holder! (How cute!)  Anyways, I finally had the chance to visit this restaurant with my coworkers on a Friday! The restaurant is located in a cute and renovated area in Shaker Square (where the RTA line is).   The interior was quite modern and cozy, and the restaurant was bustling with a steady stream of hungry customers. Ordering food is similar to Chipotle - you walk down a long counter and ask the employees to scoop certain ingredients into your lil` Pita or bowl. They offer a variety of protein options!   Here`s a link to their menu if you wanna check the ingredients! https://brassicas.com/menu/  I ordered a Pita with Falafel as my protein and a ton of veggies - btw, I highly recommend getting a scoop of spiced carrots, which they add in the final station!  The pita was HUGE (for me, at least), and the Falafel was totally yum-yums. I hate it when I get a cold, hard Falafel, but here, I got a piping hot Falafel that showcased that well-ground Chickpea texture...that probably doesn`t make much sense. It was pleasantly soft, but it still maintained some grainy texture that makes fresh Falafel so delightful to chew. The Spiced Carrots are big chunky slices of carrots that are boiled (or steamed?) and look to be glazed too. I wasn`t really looking too much because I started nomming on the Pita ASAP (oopsies!). It`s called '"Spiced'" Carrots, but it isn`t really spicy at all. So for people who don`t like spice, these carrots are safe for you!  I come from a foodie haven, aka Southern California (where there is an abundance of young and hip Foodie Millennials), so I`ve tried quite a lot of '"Foodie'" destinations. But...this place was a standout in my memory. It was one of the best, quick n` easy to order Middle Eastern restaurant I`ve eaten at. If I wasn`t so hesitant/lazy to drive out so much, I`d maybe go here once every 3 days... but I guess it`s good that I`m lazy, because that prevents me from spending too much on food!  I think this is a great restaurant to try on the East side. If you haven`t been here yet, I say it`s time to plan out a day to eat here!"<9<12<2019<17<9<33

As I frequent Chinatown a lot. It is less than 6 months old. Walking in, you are greeted with a Welcome in Mandarin by the workers there who are very nice and welcoming. The menu itself has a big variety from a large selection of different milk teas to regular tea, like you would find at your big chain bubble tea places like Coco or chatime. I ordered the passionfruit yakult and my friend ordered the Fresh orange and grapefruit tea. I usually order the mango jasmine milk tea with pudding but decided to try something else. And again and again I`m not disappointed. Although, it took some time to make the drinks. It was totally worth it, the passionfruit yakult was not too sweet but could taste the passionfruit and It was made with real passionfruit as I could see and taste the pulp in the drink. Pricing is pretty much the same as going to Chatime or Coco but this place is definitely a place you need to go to. Everything is fresh and they do not skimp on the toppings at all. Their slogan is '" More topping included than you think'" and honestly they live up to this. This is the place to go to if you are looking to stray away from generic big chain bubble tea. They have quite some locations in Toronto. But this is the only one in the downtown core!"<11<12<2019<3<49<36

We got here around 10am on a Tuesday and the parking lot was relevantly empty. I told the lady at the front we were '"new'" and she was very helpful in explaining everything. We settled on going from spot 1-2, which was about 2 hours including the bus ride to/from. We rented tubes from them and one extra for our cooler (generic big cooler size). It didn`t fit nicely in the tube, but was a little tilted - they assured us it would be fine. Cooler was packed to the brim (I didn`t know what to expect - a famine? lol) and we were off. Bus ride to the drop spot was fine, driver was very friendly - helped you get on/off. Walk down to the water was fine. Water was FREEZING when you got in, but you felt absolutely perfect as you floated along. This is the PERFECT thing to do on a summer day! We covered two tubes with a queen size fitted sheet, so that we would stay together, which worked great! No burn from the hot black tube and you don`t have to worry about hanging onto each other.   Everything was AMAZING until literally the last five minutes of our float. We could see the bridge in the distance (where you get off) and were sad it was ending... and then... some rapids. We didn`t think much of it at first, but it didn`t take long to discover that these weren`t just any rapids. Before long my mom was tipped out of her tube, our cooler dumped out of the tube - the cooler`s lid ripped off and literally everything I had brought was floating down the river. Oh yeah, including MY KEYS which, like a complete dummy, I had put in the cooler...   Long story short, we lost most of our food and a pair of shoes, but found everything else including the keys (HALLELUJAH!). Was a rough end to a perfect float, but we will just be more aware next time and float to the right. Not sure if we missed a more calm exit or are just morons, since everyone else did not seem to have an issue lol."<11<7<2019<1<18<5

QOZdkGW_faUVkId6iDytDw<BpP2dVTr2cgU5N-OXAP2lQ<yn4Cwv98Mf8nu1Q2uriTtw<1<0<0<0<Hello John B. First off, I`d like to say that I do not know your company, or what your values are. Greed is probably the highest of them I can imagine. Me, my wife, and our four kids would like to thank you for making us homeless this holiday season.  Now we never signed a lease with your company and I`m glad we never will. Our landlords sold the property to you on the condition you keep us as tenants for the remainder of our 2nd year lease. Wouldn`t you know it? After paying our first rent to you on time, we were greeted with a notice to vacate for renovations. We begged and pleaded for more time to find a new place live and to let our children at least finish out the school semester. You couldn`t even wait a month, or offer us another property to rent?  Yes we were paying a hundred dollars short of what the zillow rent price was, but I myself personally performed renovations to increase the value and aesthetics of the property.  Now instead of eating Thanksgiving and enjoying the company of loved ones we will be packing everything we own.   Now if you had just left it there yeah we would have had hard feelings towards each other, but I guess the money talks louder than your morals. Your company sends us a letter to clean the appliances and house before we leave to receive our security deposit. Now, mind you, the only appliances that were in the house when we moved in were the stove, waterheater and heater/AC unit. Then you tell me that you own them because you claim they were listed with the house? No sir, I paid for them. So while gathering all of our belongings on Thanksgiving,  I also have to find receipts to prove to you they are my property and contact the realty company that sold the house. Guess what? They were not listed.   We also do not have a lease with you, you want to kick us out, you lie to me, and you also want me to clean to get our security deposit back? No thanks I`d have more faith in getting struck by lightning or hitting the Powerball than getting that deposit back. As a craftsman, and a handyman, I will leave my work intact, and clean for the next one you sucker in.   It shocks me that a company that bullies, lies, and has no value for other human beings is still in business. You are not people you are monsters. You kick tenants while they are down, and walk all over them.   So John B., Park Avenue Properties, and whoever reads this just know what this company stands for: money not morals.<6<12<2019<7<31<24

Though people can have good, bad, and ugly experiences, I will explain one of each that I have had since being a patient here personally.  The Good: Couple things here I really want to mention. There is a ton of the staff that work, and volunteer here that don`t get the credit they deserve at all. Starting with the people that work at the information booth. There at all times to help those in need, and they`ve always been nice to me. Then there`s the kitchen staff, those who put up with the worst of us. They deal with grumpy people who think that just because you`re a veteran, AND YES I`M ONE TOO, you think you`re entitled to having your omelette in 10 seconds flat. Be nice for once, it will change your life.  The Bad: So, when it comes to the bad, this mostly falls into the parking category. The parking garage will fill up before 9am on Monday-Friday. It is nearly impossible to find parking. Security claims that staff are not allowed to park in there, but I see staff park there every single time I go. Which is more than 2x a month. Also, I wish they would hurry with the amount of construction going on. The ER department is still under renovation. This is where my second bad experience, the ER. I once checked in for something, and the wait wasn`t the bad thing. I know and understand how trauma and the procedures for evaluating what and who needs help first. My problem is that they had me in a bed, shoved in some hallway, with people walking in multiple times. Patients, family, nurses, and everything in between that had no clue what was going on.  The Ugly: So my biggest complaint, which I have talked to Patient Advocacy about is the pharmacy. There`s multiple patients who wait at exactly at 9am for the pharmacy to open. When it does, it can take up to 1 hour for your number to be called, and god knows how long till you can get your meds filled. It truly is sad that I have to wait up to 2 or more hours before I can get my medications filled. Then they try to push the pharmacy refill by mail on all of us. Some of us work full time, and can`t be at home for the medications that require signatures.<7<9<2017<23<20<19

Make sure you talk to a HUMAN who`s actually a licensed contractor.  They (Paul) will show you that the company is licensed.  Again, I repeat, ask which actual human is a licensed contractor?  Or..actually, just don`t use this company.  The review by Tom S is bogus.  He`s the actual owner.  He`s the one who`s licensed.  Nice guy, but you won`t talk to him or see him.  So if you want to use this company, demand to talk to Tom.  Red flags all over the place and this company paid the price because of all the unethical practices they (Paul) pulled on me.  Paul is disorganized at best, rude, and unethical.  I won`t go into details with my experience, just that, I filed a complaint with the board of contractors and boy, things sure turned around.  I thought it would change the operation, but I guess not.   So, do your homework if you decide to use this company.<7<5<2019<15<55<1

We make it a point to come here at least once every time we are in Vegas. We love the patio seating right in the middle of St Mark Square with perfect viewing of the intermittent live entertainment. This evening we were serenaded (not literally to us lol) by a very talented opera singer showing off his vocals to Nessun Dorma and it was beautiful. We started with the beef carpaccio and the caprese salad, two of our favs. Next we had the grilled Mediterranean Sea bass with golden Yukon potatoes, tomatoes and olives, and the lobster ravioli. I must say that every single night was full of flavor and perfectly made. We will continue our traditional stop every time we come to town and you should too!!<8<11<2019<2<28<49

We made reservations for around 5pm on a Sunday evening. Upon arrival we were greeted and didn`t have to wait any more than 5 breaths before they seated us. We sat close to the kitchen so we got to see a lot of the hustle and bustle. Our server was very welcoming, chatty and friendly. She answered a few questions, jotted down our picks and not long after we had some stale bread and their white bean spread. It was underwhelming but something to nosh on as we were ready for our apps. I went with their calamari which I felt I got the bottom of the bag. It was more like popcorn calamari. See pic. My husband ordered the Roasted Beet salad which I wish I had gone that route. His had that perfect earthy, zing combination. For our entrees with both went with the Roasted Salmon Filet. We were either starving or it was everything our tastebuds were dying for at that moment. All the flavors were harmonizing together. Not too salty. The portions were just right as well. For dessert, I went with the tiramisu. It was rich and had just the right amount of powerful espresso punch.<1<2<2017<21<1<38

We worked with Jack and Jason to purchase a used Toyota after e-mailing them the best offer on a comparable vehicle at another dealership. They quickly replied with a better offer even though the car here had even less mileage. They also matched the other dealership`s KBB trade-in offer no questions asked! Not only that, but San Tan VW only included the bare minimum tax/title/preparation fees in their quote, while the other dealership tried to sneak in over $1000 of unnecessary fees and '"package upgrades'" that we didn`t ask for.  We communicated completely over email, and Jack and Jason prepped the paperwork in advance so all we had to do was come in for a test drive after we got off work and sign.   When we arrived there was absolutely no push back on the agreement or attempt to change the deal, just an honest, straightforward, easy breezy approach to selling a car.

Food: Shrimp cold rolls - For $9, this was overpriced. It was mostly noodles.  Pad kee mao- this was probably the best item out of everything. But nothing amazing either.  Gaeng kiew whan (green curry) - this was horrible because it was served at room temperature. The curry was not even warm. I feel like they must have big pots of curry in the kitchen and it`s just poured into a bowl when a customer orders it. It is not being warmed in the kitchen. The rice that came with it was so stiff. The rice did not seem fresh.  Overall:  The food quality was terrible and I probably wouldn`t return or recommend it.<20<10<2019<4<16<10

People need to stop writing reviews if they have never attended or have just visited, It`s giving potential students the wrong idea. You will regret attending.  This school`s career services are a joke.  The legit teachers on current projects do a better job of helping students with jobs after they graduate.  The people are awesome, yes. Faculty and students alike. Great friends but the schooling and amount of relevant educational material is pathetic, no matter how hard you work at trying to be involved and a part of the school, the services and support UAT '"provides'" falls short of industry standards.  This isn`t a college it`s like a second version of High School. Half of my friends transferred to other colleges, a handful (including myself) pushed through and stuck it out because we were too far in) and ALL of the people I know that have attended have regretted it. If they let the Alumni forums combine with the Incoming students, you`d see for yourself all the stories people are telling of their time here. They`d never do that though for fear of losing potential students.  It`s all smoke and mirrors and it kills me when I see kids walking in for that tour, '"ooh look shiny things and video games!'"

When we requested reseating, she obliged. Ambiance is open and noisy; plenty of room between tables; hard to hear the person across from you.  Waitrons, all female, wear a uni of skintight workout clothes.  So, like, if you`d like to do some Bikram yoga with your breakfast, maybe they can oblige.  Did I mention that they all appear to have been ordered from the same Chinese rubber factory?  '"Huevos con masa'" looked offbeat and interesting - a change from the usual breakfast stuff.  It was not.  Two not-very-hot eggs atop highly sweetened dry cornbread with a wobbly sauce that looked like cat upchuck.  Al dente dinner potatoes and a vicious-looking spear of fruit.    Hey people - masa is not the same thing as cornbread.  WTF?  We looked at this and my pal ordered toast.  The waitress brought it promptly.  He asked for butter.  She looked at him funny, went back, eventually brought that out.  Then he asked for jam.  She looked at him funny again, and returned with some very nice raspberry preserves.  Evidently on this planet, people don`t eat toast, and if they do, there better not be anything on it.  Total for breakfast about $30; we left two nearly-full plates of food on the table.

The sitting areas are spacious and comfortable, and if you`re willing to get there early (like 4am early) you can stake out a good area for the whole tournament. The screens are huge and the waitresses are quick to come around. Make sure to get your drink tickets when you place your bets! You usually get a free drink ticket for every $50 bet but if you tip the bet taker at the counter they`ll hook you up with a nice stack. You can also do some crafty betting on the horse races and get drink tickets that way.

The server did not know the menu at all and we had to point and show her what we wanted to order. The menu isn`t that expansive either! We ordered the pan fried gyoza, 2 different types of ramen and a rice bowl. When I ordered the spiciest ramen the server was so surprised (to the point I felt like she didn`t think I should get it). The gyoza was okay, one of them I had wasn`t cooked properly and the wrapper was a little dense at one end. The ramen was okay, definitely not that spicy so feel free to get the highest level. The rice bowl was probably the better item we ordered and even that had way too much rice in proportion to the meats and veggies.

I hear they`ve gone through recent renovations so everything is really clean and nice looking on the inside from what I could see.  It`s still not an extremely large buffet but it`s a decent selection (not much sushi aside from cali rolls, crab meat rolls, and shrimp nigiri). They`ve got all the American-Chinese basics and they aren`t bad tasting either. We`ve ordered take out from next door somewhat frequently and we aren`t disappointed.  It`s an entirely self service buffet, which means all they do is take your dirty plates. Everything else you get yourself. They were all nice to us.

I posted this on Google and want to make sure to reach Yelpers as well to help them avoid the same mistake I made. Avoid City Chevrolet at all costs.  Absolute worst experience ever - and I don`t even own the car anymore. I leased a 2013 Equinox in March 2013. In 2016, when the lease was almost over, I wanted to purchase the car. I asked the salesman for DAYS to let me know what information he needed to expedite my time in the store, and he (nor anyone else that I called) was able to answer. After spending 3 hours in the store, he finally came up to me and said '"this was all I needed, honey'" and pointed a few account numbers. The exact information I had been asking to provide for me. Condescending jack***.  The real awful part of it all is their own paper work error. My last car automatic withdrawal for the lease should have come in July 2016. I bought the car in June, so I assume someone, somewhere reported to GM Financial that the terms and conditions had changed because the payment was never withdrawn (I didn`t go in and change anything on my end). Come to find out in January, City Chevrolet took my bank`s money for the buy out, but waited over a month to pay GM Financial. So I have a credit report with 16 years of perfect credit, and one late payment. I called the credit bureau, and they said they would fix it, but now I am finding out the City Chevrolet disputed the claim. I have been calling them for weeks now to fix it, but they won`t even call me back. They are completely incompetent, self-motivated, condescending jerks. I wouldn`t buy a car here for half price. It`s not worth the annoyance of having to deal with people that clearly have NO clue what they are doing with even the most basic car functions.   DO NOT BUY A CAR HERE!"<30<8<2017<17<31<27

And it wasn`t crowded at all. There were maybe 10 people at the top when we arrived, but only ran into 2-3 heading up. Since it`s a switchback (zig-zag pattern), the trail is on a consistent gradient making it manageable for any fitness level. Some parts might have you breathing heavy but this trail isnt occupied like Camelback, so you won`t be in anyone`s way if you decide to break.

I purchased and prepaid a one-year package to service 2 heating and 2 cooling systems.  They came and checked my cooling systems in the spring and it went well.  However, when it came time in the fall to check on the heating systems, the worker who came was told to only service 1 heating system, and that the company had no record that I had paid at all and that I was going to get charged again.  The worker was nice enough to check both for me, but it made me feel guilty that perhaps I didn`t pay for it, and he probably felt like he was doing extra work for me.  After he left, I spent an hour going through all my records and lo and behold, I DID indeed pay for the package! I was told to take a picture and text it over!  If I didn`t find it, I would have gotten charged again!    The next week or so, I got a call asking if I wanted to purchase another year package.

The hashbrowns on the other hand were a bit of a let down.  While a nice sized portion they had little flavor.  I also opted to get a half order of french toast for an extra $5.  The French Toast was quite delicious and if I go back, I`ll just go with that.   The food for price ratio is pretty good, overall this place would be a 4 if the service was better and has the potential to be a 5 depending on what you order and the service you get.<4<8<2016<20<35<48
684RMrlUqpdwm0nCI-HyzQ<2CXNnkwqKCMqfVyfqEZuCg<togzltbV52oGR-a0jddqZw<1<1<0<0<Horrible place ever. Worst customer service ever. This was my first time here and I wanted a gel manicure done. First of all, when you enter the salon, the  female(apparently the manager) who attends you treats you like trash. Tells you to wait for 30 minutes which actually goes on for an hour. The waiting was still acceptable, what threw me off is how she threw the basket of nails on me, and I was stunned. I was tolerating that behaviour thinking it`s rush hour (a weekend), there were a lot of customers. Upon asking her some general questions about the manicure, she got really pissed and rushed back to her place leaving me confused and intimidated. Not only that, when I got assigned a seat to get the services done, the person who was doing my nails didn`t give me instructions to do it and kept on blaming me for not being the best customer in a very passive aggressive way. I tried striking a sweet conversation with the person who was doing my nails, but they didn`t really care about it. Post that, the female who did my nails offered me to do a pedi . I said yes. And then the manager loses her shit. She says in an angry tone, `she only told manicure???!!` I snapped back by saying look, your person offered me to do it, I just said yes. If you don`t wanna do it,lmk I`ll leave. And she shut her mouth after that. She told me I will have to wait again for an hour. Literally for no reason. When people were available. Some more passive aggressive stares followed, but I just completed my stuff for the sake of it. If you really want to relax and have a peace of mind, do not ever go here.<9<11<2019<21<3<22
6EI2bfg5rZY0xIYZ8RUbTw<14HuaxwO8Lj8WYsy2GIqbQ<utIA0LyQmwP-9DRyxUe6qQ<5<8<1<1<Things I learned today at Snooze (a Wednesday morning at 7:15am)  1. Don`t come unless you`ve got at least an hour to eat.  The restaurant was at probably 40% capacity and it still took 40 minutes to get food on the table.  I ordered their special (eggs, chicken sausage, hash browns, toast), so nothing should have taken that long.  2.  Regardless of the way you`re greeted by the people at the host station, they`re supposed to seat you.  There were two employees at the entrance when I walked in.  One looked at me, said good morning, then went back to talking to the other.  Since the two customers in front of me had also just walked in without assistance, I figured that`s what I was supposed to do.  In hindsight, this is probably what caused a lot of the service issues today.  3. The servers must all be new.  I ordered a chai off the drink menu on the table before I got a menu.  When I did get a menu, I ordered quickly.  The waiter left, then he came back to ask if I wanted butter or jelly for the toast.  I asked for butter. I was asked if I wanted it on the toast or on the side.  I said on the toast was fine.  4. 15 minutes later I was told that their espresso machine was messed up and my chai would be delayed.  5. Five minutes later my food came out of the kitchen.  I have no silverware, napkin, drink, or condiments, but the plate gets dropped off and the server is gone.  No butter on the toast or plate, but it`s the only thing I can eat with no silverware.  6. Another five minutes until I see my waiter again.  I ask for water, silverware, and ketchup.  Since the chai still isn`t there I ask that it be cancelled. I got an apology and an assurance that it will be cancelled.  7. Three more minutes for water and silverware, no ketchup. I ask for the check.  8. Three minutes later I get the check and the chai.  The waiter says he`ll take care of the chai.  I leave my credit card with the check while I wolf down my food.  The chicken sausage was really good.  Everything was good or better, but I had to inhale it so it wasn`t enjoyable.  9. Another employee grabs my check and runs to the front.  Looks like I`m paying for the chai anyway.  I thought about trying to get a to-go cup, but I couldn`t wait another ten minutes or more.    UPDATE : Snooze asked me to come back, and I had the exact opposite experience.  I was greeted, seated, had silverware and a drink very quickly, and the food was excellent.<1<2<2017<22<24<18

UgTP9Wpgg6dMXgbi-HjZEQ<zjuBliArnZuQ9qLHuamn1g<AK3DB_S_emr4tHODwm4HdQ<2<1<0<0<"I recently bought a new bed set for which I was super excited as I`ve been waiting for years!  Leon`s Calgary`s Salesperson Frank was very knowledgeable and patient as we tried all the different types, etc.  I chose my box spring, mattress and headboard and received what I ordered on the date chosen.  Great!  However, I needed a Queen Size bed frame and Frank said they had an adjustable one - up to King Size.  I said directly; '"I don`t need a king size, will never own a king size, and only buy what I need - which is queen.'"     I also told Frank if they don`t have a queen I`ll buy one somewhere else.   He said okay and all of sudden `found one` that was my size.  When it was delivered and my friend and I struggled to put it together - I found it sticks out WAY TOO FAR from the bottom of the bed.  It was the queen/king size adjustable frame!!!! ARGH.    When I phoned to have it switched I was told by customer service that there are NO returns on anything - ever.  This serious fact was NEVER pointed out to me during the sale!! Not okay.  I said I want an exchange anyway not a refund.  Customer service said she would have to chat with Frank to see if I really did tell him I only wanted a Queen.  I have a feeling he will LIE as he did to me so he`s not in trouble - or whatever.  I will see how they manage this exchange and I will write another review to update the final result.    The bed, box spring, and headboard are great!  We`ll see if they make this right OR if I`m to lead a life of very bruised shins along with my grandchildren!   Make it right Leons!!! JoAnne"<28<6<2018<17<5<0

I had the chicken parmigiana it was OK tasted like frozen, processed chicken heated in a toaster oven. My salad came without any dressing on it for some reason. The Pizza my parents ordered came with raw ham and a soupy texture of cheese and sauce with raw dough blended in. On the bottom, it was burnt. The chef came by and said what`s wrong you don`t like my pizza?  You don`t wanna give me a chance to make it right? She was very aggressive.

zKAhe4g0Uqz7kb61h7w_Wg<imdp8zd4MUBTk_oHH50Ulw<Mbb2Y-uyCxU-5j-4S6_txw<2<0<0<0<Overall- chicken fingers were ok (raising canes` are better). Tater tot`s were OK. Mac & cheese bites were gross. Oreo mint shake was AMAZING.  There seems to be no designated spot to pick up online orders which is causing them problems. I had to wait behind a son and father who were obviously not ready to order. No one asked me to step up- my order was pre-paid so anyone could`ve grabbed it so my prepared order literally just sat there and got cold because there was no one on the register at first and when they did come up I had to wait for the two guys to order who took a long time to decide. Either get a second cashier or choose a designated area for pick up orders. Packaging on takeout was very weird. They gave me a large handle bag that was open which was very frustrating because all the food was cold by the time I got it. Also rather than an actual to go box for hot items they instead used deli trays (not even any liners to absorb the grease!)- thin flimsy open trays that further hurt the food quality because there`s no way that it would stay hot in those trays... those are portioning trays, not to go packaging. Looks like the fryer needed to be skimmed because I got more than my fair share of black burnt crumbles with my food. Decor was nice. Overall service was not friendly. In fact the McDonald`s across the street gives much better service which is pretty crazy because it`s a McDonald`s. I will go back for the shake but that`s about it! Chicken fingers, tots, Mac and cheese bites and a shake was $17.... my food should be hot for that much and in a darn box not open portion tray getting cold.<27<9<2019<0<8<44

I lived at this complex from 2014-2019, and the property was typically quiet and management was easy to reach and resolve the few issues that came up. I have recommended this property to several people trying to move to Vegas with either large dogs (accepted here, no breed restrictions) or foreclosures/broken leases in their credit history- they offer second chance financing. I initially signed a lease sight unseen, based on proximity to my job before moving to Vegas, and really lucked out with such a positive experience.   Signage states that this is a '"luxury apartment community'" - over my time here, flooring was upgraded from carpet to wood laminate. Overall, floor plans, counters, appliances, etc are pretty standard. Noteworthy amenities include pools (one indoor, one outdoor), gym (separate key required but equipment a bit dated), and a tanning bed (did not use). Pricing is competitive with the area, rent includes WiFi through LVNet (never had issues) and discounted DirecTV service ($5/month service charge).  Lea (manager) and Quin (front office) were easy to work with. When repairs needed to be made, they were typically addressed quickly. Location is very convenient - public transportation (bus stop right outside gate), easy freeway access, can get to Chinatown, Strip, Summerlin, etc in under 15 minutes. No issues with safety or security, property is gated and they have patrols at night with an emergency line. Very quiet community!"<30<9<2019<20<20<51

Meeting room was nice with dining room attached.   Bathroom for group was for one. So break time there was always a line.   Lots of work to make things work. And everything was part of a different plan. I might be Gold, but wasn`t in a Fairmont Gold room so didn`t have access to those benefits.  Fairmont Fit is still the best perk of any hotel chain, where you know if you are going to a Fairmont, workout clothes and sneakers can be provided by the hotel!  Checkout was a non-negotiable noon, and with a redeye it would have cost me another days hotel stay to enjoy the area post meeting.  Leaving luggage with bellman and changing in the steak place bathroom was the best solution, although not very comfortable.  Restaurants opened and closed at different times.  American Kitchen which was very good, closed at 3 pm.  Lobby Bar opened at 3.

I don`t like to be near ice machines or elevators and my first room was about 15 ft from both.  They accommodated my request to change rooms.  My second room (219) was decent. Clean although there was some type of stain on one of the couch cushions.  Didn`t want to speculate as to what that might be (eewww).  Not much sound insulation given the proximity to the airport.  I`ve been in hotels close to the airport that did better with muting airplane/external noise.  As a result, sleep was limited to 11:00 p.m.  and 5:00 a.m. when flights were generally quiet.  Since I`m a light sleeper this was a problem for the whole stay.  Another noise source was people urinating in the toilet followed by the sound of flushing toilets in nearby rooms which is always nice in the middle of the night.  Not as restful as I would have preferred.  During times I wanted to relax,  TV viewing options were limited.  Stations 2 through 17 didn`t work the majority of the time (finally fixed my fourth and final night).  That meant only one local news channel, no ESPN, CNN, MSNBC, etc.  To Marriott`s credit they offered compensation for the inconvenience as it impacted others besides me.     All in all the stay was okay.  Rate was good but I will probably look to stay elsewhere next time I`m in Phoenix away from low-altitude airplane routes.<3<12<2019<23<49<50

Meals arrived after long wait...one meal was cold had to be sent back, food was hot and cold on plates, sIde dishes were mediocre over salted and loaded with pepper. No one checked on us at all, someone finally tossed dessert on table while dirty plates were actually still there..  all the way to end dirty plates sat on edge of table, coffee w dessert was not same as initial coffee...it tasted burnt, noone could drink it and worse sweet potato pie we`ve ever had, like candy...left on table uneaten w coffee.

I have been browsing around Yelp for a jeweler in Las Vegas to perform rhodium plating on my wedding set and a new art deco-style eternity band that I received for Valentine`s day. However, the art deco band felt '"tight'" even though it was ordered to be 5 1/2 (the same size as my wedding set, but made by a different jeweler).  Thank you Yelpers for your reviews as that`s how I came to discover Desert Diamond Jewelers. I sent them a message asking for a quote (including photos) for rhodium plating on 3 rings and potential resizing. They got back to me very quickly, answered my additional questions, and I decided to stop by the next morning.   I was quickly greeted by Bill and he remembered us messaging the night before. When I spoke with him about my '"tight'" band, he confirmed that it was 5 1/2 on the dot so we measured my wedding set to be sure and lo and behold - it was 5 3/4..... :p We spoke about the resizing and the additional layer of difficulty to perform this for a full eternity band with stones all around, but I requested to forge ahead with the resizing. He also gave the center stone on my engagement ring a look and spoke with me about ensuring to get it looked at (especially the prongs) every 6 months - which they do here!  The turnaround time for the resizing of one ring and rhodium plating of 3 rings was AMAZING (I was happily surprised) and I quickly got my babies returned to me!   Bill also made sure to talk to me about ring cleaning/maintenance and when I was trying to find the '"spot'" where they did the resizing - I couldn`t! They`re that good! Also, he gave my center stone a quick wipe (LOL) before I left because I kept touching it since I was in AWE by how everything looked after a cleaning and rhodium plating. They look brand new! The pricing was extremely fair for the value of work that I received."<24<3<2019<4<25<6

xxjw0uw4p4Zemh7Ra8Uzbg<GN0Via1A5zVEMUzX6StZTw<kpdoFZTo3IP2gKdJYgpCOw<1<0<0<0<"I have had the WORST experience with JCP Portraits. I made an appointment online a month in advanced, We (my family and I) were thirty minutes early for our appointment so we expected waiting time and then ended up having to wait an hour and thirty minutes for a rushed photographer that didn`t take very good quality photos but we settled with not doing the retake and waited an additional hour for them to call us up to view the images and ended up settling with two. We purchased the over one hundred dollars digital album and my job provided 24 Christmas cards. We then were told it would take 24/48 hours max for the email notification with my pictures and no later than December 3rd for my cards. Almost a week later I called questioning any notification a woman on the phone stated she was going to have to call customer service and call me back, I received no call. I waited three more days and called customer service myself and they had a HORRIBLE attitude and said I basically was screwed if I dont receive my email and there was nothing I could do. I called the location back and nothing, they just said they would call customer service again... it is now December 6th and I called customer service Tuesday December 3rd (still no notifications at all) and the man told me sarcastically '"Do you know how to properly check your email, let me what you through it because it can be hard for some people'" I explained to him I was 25, a former programmer and working for a photography company so my knowledge of computer software and etc isn`t average he was completely rude and sarcastic and continued as if he didn`t believe me. I demanded to speak to a Supervisor he stated the supervisor couldn`t talk to me and it would take 2-3 weeks for a call back or he could put me in a 5+ hour queue or I could let him '"push it through'" so I agreed to the only choice that seemed like was gonna get me my photos so I gave him the necessary information needed and he hung up on me...so rude. Anyway I received an email stating '"The album has been pushed through this can take up to 24 hours to go through. If you still do not get the album please email me back and we can go through the next steps to try and get this album to you. '" so again that was the third it is the sixth and nothing I emailed back that next morning and again this afternoon and nothing.  This is RIDICULOUS and has RUINED so many planned Christmas gifts/ cards/ and etc. I asked for a refund and got laughed at and received a coupon for $25 off my next purchase...i dont know if anyone is aware of how expensive JCP Portraits are I had a coupon for 60% off from my job and still paid over a hundred dollars for just a digital copy."<6<12<2019<17<11<55

wokI6kQfmAF1nfB4SwjmUg<zo-rvpkK9dq9QaB0DmKHHg<qrSsS0pk7SL67MP5nN8tlg<1<5<2<0<"This is probably our worst restaurant experience ever. We are so tired of traditional Canadian food, so chose this French restaurant to have some European style dinner. We considered prices and rating, plus this restaurant was the best one in Sheppard Avenue area.   So we came there and were surprised to come across very nice and cozy restaurant in this quite area. We were greeted (it looked indeed French, as staff was bilingual, that`s nice) and seated upon arrival and all pretty things ended up here. I`ve made a list of things which may explain my given rating:  1. Long waiting time. - After making an order we have been waiting almost for an hour just to get regular pasta! We kindly asked a couple of times if the dish is ready, and all we got was that it`s cooking. I know that a high quality food does take some time to be cooked, but not an hour and with no notice! Plus, people, who came later, got their meals earlier than we did, and it wasn`t salad by the way!   2. Careless staff. - They asked about drinks to start, we went with water without ice. They double checked this detail, and brought within 15 minutes both glasses full of ice. Why asking then? (Have I mentioned long waiting time already? Or the water was extracted from a deep well?)  Plus they kept opening and closing the front door, what made it freezing to stay in restaurant.  3. Aren`t you greedy? - After having our long-awaited dinner, when it came to paying for bill, we kindly asked if they could split amount between two of us. Yes, they did but they rounded up the initial sum (adding another $.90) to the bill. We don`t mind the money, BUT at least you could ask about it, right? This is irresponsible and unfair.  As a result of such a '"diligent'" work, we decided not to leave tips. Once the waiter saw this, he said that tips could be very appreciated. We kindly told him what was wrong. And you know what! The waiter stated the following: '"If you don`t leave tips, then don`t ever come here again!'"   To be honest, we were more than shocked! If you work in French restaurant, then do your job as you would work in France, not Montreal (later we found out that some staff was actually from Montreal, that`s why they spoke French). Tips are expected for providing exceptional customer service, which they didn`t prove. Extortion is not a resolution!"<1<9<2017<15<4<17

WsXEE0sejxWfMpGoo8hd-A<WzR2lur-sXnTDycgoDe34g<KOdbik6zBGg4PjNbapr5ug<1<3<0<0<UPDATE:  since I provided the negative reviews all over the internet the rude lady Sumati just phoned me from Loan Away and has given me till the end of the today to pay $800 or they are upping it to $1200.  I have contacted the Better Busiiness Bureau and seeking legal advice. I recommend anyone going through something similar to do the same. They need to be made accountable  They are crooks. I took out a $1000 loan for 1 year from them back in May 2016. In September I was laid off work (7 payments in) and informed them of my situation. Each payment I made paid into their insurance for situations like this. The first person I spoke with refused to assist me in obtaining the insurance claim information. I was finally able to obtain it through another woman working there and made my claim. The insurance company made 12 payment on my behalf. Throughout this time they still harassed me for payments regularly. After the insurance confirmed the final payment on the account they went quiet. I tried reaching out to them to find out what was remaining to settle the account and they never got back to me so i figured everything was settled. In March 2018 i pulled my credit report to see that they were reporting that i owed them $1700. So again i emailed them with all the details including the final letter from the insurance confirming they had paid $716. Again no response. I finally decided to call and was informed by a very rude lady that now I owe them $1900. She refused to put me through to a manager as well as providing me with her name. I hung up the phone and received a call back from an apparent supervisor who sounded exactly like the original lady I spoke with. Again no manager is available. I offered them $400 to settle this account. She said she would talk to her manager. But I thought her manager wasnt available. She called me back with $800 to settle which is ludicrous. I pleaded with them to even except $600, but she kept saying not possible. If I dont pay them $800 by October they are upping it to $1200.   Stay away from this unethical company full of liars and crooks.<27<9<2018<20<25<44

I have been to some of the best ramen bars in NYC, Philly, and DC so I am not really that surprised that Ki Ramen could not compare. The noodles did not seem very fresh and the meat had too much fat to the point were I could not eat most of it. Our waiter was very friendly and the decor is very nice.

It was literally so good that I almost didn`t even save half for lunch the next day. I was that much of a hog. The vegetarian ramen dish has squash and mushrooms in it with a very mild broth. The problem was that I really wish that the squash wasn`t a big hunk of squash and was maybe in cubed form. Was a little hard to eat with a chopstick since it was literally the side of a squash plopped right in the middle of the bowl but I`m telling you this dish was out of this world. We also went earlier so there wasn`t that many people there and it wasn`t loud or crowded which really made me feel a lot more comfortable than the last time that I was there. I think for me that coming earlier would be the best bet since the night-time crowd is a little bit too loud and crowded for my delicate constitution. I look forward to getting this dish again and trying maybe some of the appetizers the next time that I venture over one street from where I live to get some Ramen. Yum yum in my tum. I`m serious the vegetarian dish is the way to go. Try it out and tell me what your thoughts are. I want to know if anyone else likes this broth and this dish a lot better than any of the meat dishes that they serve.<10<2<2018<1<25<36

The fish taco could had waaaaay less guacamole and the fish should be seasoned a little bit at least.

We have been looking for a bigger tank for our fish and decided to take a family trip to The Ocean Floor. It`s not located in the best place in town and initially pulling in the parking lot is SMALL and cramped. We had to wait a good few mins for a car to pull out as you cannot go in and out of the parking lot easily. Once we got ourselves parked we were surprised when we walked in. Giant beautiful tanks and live coral reef tanks when you walked in. I didn`t expect it to be so big but it was and the kids loved it! There are plenty of tanks to look at and TONS of beautiful tropical fish. There was also a large Koi pond and an option to feed them on the weekends. The kids were excited to feed them but when we went up to the register the gal stated they were done with the feedings for the day. We understand not wanting to over feed the fish but would have been cool to do hopefully next time we can. Overall, it was pretty neat to see all the fish and stuff they have. Good place to grab some live plants as well and we will be back to buy a new tank and stand. The prices were very reasonable!!<21<10<2019<19<17<29

I had visited there several times and the service got progressively worse. I had severe problems which required hospitalization and they basically pushed me out the door because I was their last patient and they said you were just here 2 days ago! It was on a Saturday and they wanted to go home. The cellulitis had come back I told them I was going to go to the hospital and asked them if they could at least call and let them know I was coming, but they never did! Both the MA and the doctor were rude and incompetent!  My former primary care doctor (Dr. Gawelko) was located there and Last year when I had to go out of town I forgot all of medications. I called the office and left several messages asking them to call me and to call in a weeks supply of my medications which are vital to my health and they never did anything! I never got a return phone call from anybody including Dr. Gawelko, after leaving several messages. I was forced to go through my insurance company and have them issue me the necessary medications which took an entire day of vacation to do , when it could have been done by them in minutes. These are medications that if I don`t have them could cause severe health complications. This is the worst doctor and office I have ever been to! Dr. Gawelko would barely ever talk to me and never once examined me. He would just sit there and type! It`s a great location and facility! It`s just too bad that the Doctor and back staff are so horrible. The only positive thing is that the people at the front desk were very congenial and helpful. Steve P<4<8<2019<22<53<55

Staff are very friendly and do a great job.  I ordered a banquet burger and fries. The bun is oversized and good quality, but unfortunately it`s the best part of the burger. The burger patty is relatively dry, compared to other places. They offer the classic toppings (and sauteed onions) but no lettuce (they never have). Fries are very average.  I think in the case of Johnny`s you get what you pay for. It`s decent food at a good price. Nothing special, just very average.<27<9<2019<16<37<20

We ordered a bunch of food for 7 of us,  the bill was $800 (includes drinks, tax and 20% tip).   One of our dishes never came out, and there was a little back and forth before they offered to take it off the bill.   Not cheap by any means. Biggest peeve for sushi: bad rice for my nigiri.

My brothers came into town (2 from NY, 2 from Sweden) to celebrate the youngest`s wedding.  On a whim, I made the crazy suggestion that we should get matching tattoos.   In searching for a parlor that would be able to accommodate our timing, etc., I remembered meeting Mike, the owner, at my son`s soccer game.  He had said to call him if I ever needed anything.  So, I did. Between Mike, Lonnie and the other guys, we had appointments for the exact time we needed, and the drawing they came up with was exactly what we wanted.   The facility was clean, the shop was open and had plenty of room to move around, and the artists each took the time with the four of us to get our take on how we wanted our version of the same tattoo to look.   Within 2-ish hours, my brothers and I all had matching tattoos, spectacularly done and something we will be proud to show off for the rest of our lives.  The kindness and generosity of Mike and his guys is unsurpassed.  This is clearly a family-orientated shop, and it shows in the artist`s attitudes and work. Thank you, Mike and crew, for doing such an epic job on our tattoos.  I am absolutely in love with mine, and my brothers feel the same way.  Thank you for helping make a crossed-out bucket list item come true.  I promise....I will be back before I am gone.  Already have ideas floating in my head......<8<2<2015<16<23<29

Very good when you`re stumbling around late and starving. Maybe the best place on the Strip to eat. Relatively cheap too.   This is located in the Grand Bazaar Shops on front of Bally`s. It`s one of the few places that isn`t a touristy souvenir place or an overpriced bar. On the Strip most places are overpriced. Here it`s not so much. They have a pretty good menu of Mediterranean food, mostly sandwiches. It`s about $10 for most of the pitas. The falafel is pretty big, and comes with lots of vegetables. Meat options include chicken and lamb. This is one of those places they have big pieces of meat spinning around they slice. Everything is halal. They get Islamic customers but also many others.   If you`re looking for something late at night this is good. It also is completely halal. They also own the ice cream place.<20<7<2019<12<37<10

She immediately told me that she would be charging me extra because of the length and thickness of my hair.  I did not mind that.  But she proceeded to shame me through the whole treatment and make me feel pretty awful despite already charging me more.  Once she started washing my hair at the beginning of the treatment I almost felt bad and offered to buy her a coffee. She declined in an unkind way. At one point while I was waiting for the treatment to dry she was working on another client and when that client asked her who she had next she pointed to me and rolled her eyes, then she leaned to her other client and said (pointing at me) '"she has ten times the amount of hair you have.'"  She also kept telling me that I was getting a steal because my hair was so unmanageable. I felt awful and there is little I could do about the texture of my hair (besides getting a keratin treatment which is what I was there for!) it is thick, coarse, frizzy and long and this is not the first time I have felt awful about what I was born with. But I expect more at a salon dedicated to straightening.  Very disappointing.  No matter how my treatment turns out I will not be recommending this stylist to anyone"<4<12<2017<19<20<5

G8FqTVsSzEDub9FyCgzzew<g9xOd7oHofccH8qVj4cX8w<0ldxjei8v4q95fApIei3Lg<1<3<0<0<I hate to do this to a business but in this case this business has grown too large and forgot about the customer. My wife and I ordered food a couple of Sundays ago when we went on to the yelp menu online. We ordered enough food for six people and the total came out to just over $120 online. I had no problem paying for it so I went to the location and started speaking with the cashier and one of the managers. I let the manager know that I would be ordering roughly $3000 worth of food for Thanksgiving day for my place of employment, as I`m in charge of feeding 160 people. They showed me the catering menu and made sure to remind me that I needed to put the order in well in advance. I`ve ordered from Lucille`s for catering orders in the past several times and the quality of the food has always been good. Not to mention when I`m ordering for 160 people I want a company that can handle that volume and do it right. The food has to be fresh. Well, to my surprise when I was done speaking with the manager I saw my bill for the food that I was ordering right then. The bill was roughly $145, which was about $20 more than I expected. As I have no problem paying for food that I`ve ordered, the money wasn`t the issue however I went online to yelp and saw that the price clearly showed a lower price by about $25. The manager put all of the blame on yelp and said that the yelp website should`ve been changed a year ago but yelp refuses to work with Lucille`s and therefore the price would stand at $145. I can understand that sometimes errors happen however this mistake could happen to anybody and I don`t feel that the customer should pay for that so therefore I asked him to remove the $20 difference but he wouldn`t do it. No hard feelings, it was the principle of it for me so I refused to pay for the order and they got stuck with a large order of food. The manager wasn`t too happy that I refused to pay for the food, however I left out of there without food altogether. I went to another restaurant and ordered my dinner for the night. And a day later I contacted another restaurant in town and ordered $3200 worth of food for my team to be catered on Thanksgiving. I`m now in a position where I need to order roughly $3000 worth of food for Christmas day for my team in one location I won`t be considering is Lucille`s. Sometimes it`s the smallest things that you would think people would want to correct or make right for the customer. I can understand that some people would say that it wasn`t their mistake and that yelp should share some of the blame. In my opinion the management wasn`t empowered to do what was right for the customer. That decision cost them not only a $20 difference that night but rather $6000 in future business. Only a corporation would make a mistake so foolish as a restaurant with a properly trained management team would understand what the right thing is which is why my business went to a mom-and-pop barbecue shop in town who decided to stay open for me on Thanksgiving day and will do the same thing on Christmas Day and I feel good about giving them the business. I apologize for any spelling errors, but I`ve been speaking into the phone because I don`t have the patience to type a review this long on the phone`s keyboard.<6<12<2016<1<43<8

As someone who does not get manicures I really did not know what service to request and told her what I wanted. She suggested that I get Gel X nails which were perfect for me.  Upon arrival they had me pick my gel color and I didn`t wait for too long at all. Kristina did my manicure. She explained everything to me and after showing her a picture of what I wanted she helped me choose the gel colors that were right instead of what I had selected. She was able to do exactly what I asked for. The nails do not feel fake, thick, or heavy as I have experienced in the past. She did a fantastic job.  Jack did my pedicure. My last tech at a different salon had cut my toenails kind of funny. (My bad for not stopping him) Jack was able to correct the problem for the most part.

QxdMQO6WRAc9mFeX--2Hvg<B-KS9atQu-gw51QTee-jpg<YRAAdoAwqMegPKc1HUmxcQ<1<3<0<0<"We went to Red Robin on Sunday to grab lunch. I ordered the guacamole burger. When it came out, there was little to no guacamole. No problem I thought, just ask for more on the side. We had to flag down the waiter after 5+ minutes of sitting there because no one checked on us. After bringing it to his attention, he said he would bring some more out and started walking away in a frustrated, hasty manner. We tried to stop him as he walked away to ask for more drinks and he said sure. We then tried to stop him again during this same exchange and ask for more fries. He turned and said okay and kept trying to walk away, but we didn`t even have everything we needed. The last party member tried to ask for more of her side and he kept walking. We see him slam some menus into the menu holder by the host.   After 3 or so minutes, the guacamole came out, so now the burger has been sitting for around 10+ minutes and is now room temperature. It was flavorless, bland and quite pathetic for a chain that claims they have amazing burgers. For $10, it should have been a much better burger. It was the worst burger I can remember eating in the last few years. We were able to then ask him for our side of broccoli, which he just replied '"sure'", without any hospitality or sincerity. The broccoli then came out in about 10-15 minutes, after we were all done for our food. The manager did come out and apologize for the wait for our side of broccoli, and seemed sincere. I wish she was our waitress because we probably would have had a much better experience.   The only time we received service was when we had to ask for it. Other than once, we had to keep asking for our refills. Even when we waited for the check, we found ourselves just sitting there without any attention. It was the first time in a very long time I have tipped below 15%, this service was abysmal. I feel I could have made a '"how to give poor customer service'" video and used it to train servers on the don`ts of hospitality. This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a restaurant and probably the last time I will ever willingly dine at a Red Robin."<12<9<2011<14<4<49

I think it was a ploy to make money off of me. In fact my new dentist confirmed that it was. Anyway, I went in to get my fillings replaced on my right side. It was four fillings total and I swear it only took the dentist about an hour. He went through it so fast. In fact he started so quickly that even the numbing shots hadn`t even taken affect yet. I had to stop him so that they could give the shots time, and they gave me an extra shot which basically numbed my mouth the entire rest of the day (I went in around 9am in the morning). That wasn`t even the biggest problem. Immediately after I felt something was wrong. My teeth on that side were very sensitive. I couldn`t eat hard foods and eating anything cold was impossible! I kind of brushed it off thinking maybe it was because it was due to a lot of work being done at once. Well I never should have let it go. Here I am now with excruciating pain. I went into my new dentist who took X-rays and advised that the prior dentist got extremely close to my nerve. So now guess what?! I get to have a root canal to fix this. Hopefully my tooth is salvageable. I felt perfectly fine before. I had no issues with chewing or eating cold foods. Now I`m miserable. And I have to pay even more money to fix something that I didn`t need in the first place.

My first year was fine. Hence why I signed on for year two. Year two started out with a bang, literally. At 10:30 pm there was gun fire that work me up. I called the police and notified the management company. They said they did not get any other calls about any gun shots. Made me feel like a lair. My neighbors up stairs where on the patio when it happened and they confirmed with me they heard it too.   Then spring came around and started to notice bees my front light. This went on for over two months before they found out there was an infestation of bees. I came home after work to see my apartment with do not cross tape all around it. Management did not notify me what so ever that there was going to be no access to my apartment. Thankfully I was able to go to dinner with a friend.   The day after the bee infestation was addressed, there were thousands of dead bees on the landings. My neighbors little girl stepped on one and got stung. This is a major heath and safety issue . I reported this and thankfully that was taken care of later that day.   Then the incident this weekend happened. I was at home at 5 pm on saturday evening in the middle of doing things for work. I get a knock on my door by two unknown '"Thug-ish'" looking men. I immediately made sure my door was locked. I noticed as i was peering out the looking hole in the door that one of the men had his hand on my door knob! They heard the click of my lock and then started banging on my door like animals. The first thing in my mind to do is to protect myself. I went to my kitchen and grabbed the largest knife I could find. I kept looking out the peering hole and not saying any thing. They stood around for a couple of minutes and then walked though the court yard and out the front gate. THESE THUGS DONT EVEN LIVE HERE!   I called my dad who then gave me a new means of protection. I have taken self defense classes, and keep a sharp eye out to that around me. I don`t want to live my life in fear. I want to live like Im supposed to. And at Paradise falls thats not even happening!  I have emailed the office now twice about the incident and i have gotten no response. This is not acceptable. I pay my rent on time, never had a maintenance issue, and I keep to my self and don`t disturb others. And yet i get harassed by two '"THUGS'" off the street in a GATED COMMUNITY!   Paradise Falls you should be ashamed of yourself. This is not how you treat your residents.   While Im on my rant lets bring up the Federal Fair Housing Rule they broke. When I signed my lease like all residents, I signed a Crime Free Addendum stating that if I was a felon that I could not live there. Well Back in February we got a notice via mail from the state of a Sex offender living in the complex. Nice job PF. Also there are families of 6 living in a one bedroom. Max is 3. I guess the management staff don`t know about the 2+1 rule here in AZ.   Im sure im going to get a comment back from Weidner about this saying give me a call, but ill save you a call and give you this. Its time you take a good look at your staff. They are the issue.   Thats All."<23<11<2015<23<20<48

A group of 6 of us went on a busy Saturday morning. We knew that there would be a wait, but didn`t antisipate an hour wait, epecially when we were told 20 minutes. When they finally called our name 30 minutes after we checked in, 3 of us came to the host stand ready to be seated. The incredibly RUDE host told us that we needed our whole party to be seated ( I really wish she would have told us that when we checked in!!!) After the rest of our party had arrived, we walked up to the host stand and informed them that our party was complete. She then informed us that we would have to wait for a table to get up because they gave our table away. No big deal, so we stood up front and waited..... and waited..... and waited. Until finally the hostess heard us talking about how long we had waited, so she begrudgingly led us to our table while she rolled her eyes at us. The service once we sat at the table was fine, and the food was excellent. But i have NEVER been treated like that before as a guest.  I have been in the Restaraunt industry for almost 8 years, 5 of which I was a host, and 3 years as a server. I usually am not one to complain because I know how it is being on the other side of things. But seriously, the front of house service here is absolutely appauling. In my 8 years, I have NEVER treated a guest the way that I was treated here. Hopefully they hire some good people soon...<26<6<2013<16<54<10

I`ve been searching for good Thai food in montreal, and this was probably the best pad Thai I`ve had. The flavor of the sauce was noticably better than that of other places, you could taste the shrimp in the sauce, while in that of other places, it tastes more cheap and basic. It`s definately pricier than most places, I paid a total of $19, +3 for shrimp, but the quality was great.  Two things I just have to mention. I ordered takeout and they did not include hot sauce which I was a bit disappointed by. The flavor was good and it didn`t need it though. There were only 3 shrimp in the dish. They were large and tasted great but for the price I would have expected at least 4-5.<16<9<2019<3<54<56

Plastic Surgery!  Dr. Joseph Hunstad!!! In April 2019, I had a PurseString Gluteoplasty with a Medial Thigh Lift with Full Lipo of upper legs. The surgery turned out looking gorgeous as ever and the scars are super thin and with straight lines. :)  This is a such awesome improvement, since a previous doctor left me with humongous and deeply scars. :(  My very 1st consultation in January 2019 with Dr. Hunstad, I knew from just talking to him in the first 10mins, that I wanted this Outstanding Doctor to do my Surgeries from here on out. He gives that kind- hearted, and very natural comfort in his voice to you and seems to understand what you are wanting to accomplish and gives you his opinion , great options and will Answer all your questions without any hesitation. So intelligent! He always takes time with you in your  appointments , so you aren`t left hanging or on the edge with unanswered questions. I`ve been following him on Social media, for a little while prior to coming to my first consultation, I had a pretty good idea of his Wonderful Surgical work, when I stumbled across him on his Surgeries on YouTube , I just knew then, he was the one to fix, everything I needed Done.  (Love watching those videos, ;) very interesting and knowledgeable.  What I watched wasn`t just good , they were EXCELLENT!! But even better than watching is seeing the Actual results on yourself :) Highly Recommend Dr. Joeseph Hunstad!! I am ecstatic, that I did stumble across this fine doctor. He did take Excellent care of Me in the Operating Room. And I put full trust, that I`m in good hands with him for no matter what surgery I`m having done that day. Not scared at All!  His Aftercare was even better . He loves to keep a good eye on you.. I think , I came for several months afterwards it seemed , but that was OK..haha... I do enjoy going to see everyone..;).. Least I got to know the girls on 1st name bases :)  But really truly,  as many times,  as I have been to the OR , with Cosmetic Surgeries from having done by a previous Doctor , that didn`t give me good results , just a bunch of problems and botched scars , which I`m embarrassed of, and they have to be redone.  I`m glad to finally find a doctor like Hunstad, that is a '"Perfectionist'" 100% in everything they do for you! That actually wants to make you look fabulous and takes his time with you , and not rushed , so your surgery will turn out Beautiful and look awesome!! I`m looking forward to Dr. Hunstad doing my next surgery, Full Tummy Tuck on October 2019.."<18<9<2019<13<2<47

We purchased a large pine tree which was installed with the back side crushed (like we weren`t going to find out eventually??). After going to speak with them they said they would replace it but we had to pay another $90 for installation. Then they delivered a worse looking tree than the first which was installed crooked and just plopped on top of the ground!  After half a season one complete side is dead.   So going in to talk with them they said they would replace it but we`d have to buy another $400 tree. We brought pictures of both trees and all the receipts but they say no, even knowing the installer was the problem.   Not much of a '"warranty'", right?  Home Depot does a better job standing behind their trees. What a huge disappointment and a shame because we would rather shop locally   So bottom line is this: buyer beware, you should go somewhere else to buy installed trees!"<13<4<2019<12<18<5

GROW UP PEOPLE. that being said - theres plenty negative things to say about this place. lots of wasted space. i was astounded by the large area (and time i spent) wasted on replicas! its great for the children to see, dont get me wrong. but '"ok heres some more fake stuff from `a long time ago` from the other side of the world.'" and the fake jemstones...i just dont get why i would go to a museum to look at what basically amounts to counterfeits. also, the day i was there was very empty, dead in most every area. that is normally a blessing, but at this place it gives the `security` staff members your personal undivided attention. they have a rule here that your backpack only be carried ON ONE SHOULDER, and if you are wearing it properly on both shoulders they yell at you. i had 2 women who (after asked 2 or 3 times) followed me around from room to room and stared at me waiting for me to move a strap off my arm....or course being an immature man-child i gave her what she wanted. '"that backpack looks too heavy for you! come down with me and check it in a locker.'" yeah right lady...it was baffling to me why they would insist on this as a huge deal, so i asked someone '"in charge'" later (while i was being rule-abiding one shoulder museum goer) and she explained that '"people that wear their backpacks correctly forget that theyre wearing them, and turn around abruptly and knock over things or people'"!!! [oops i forgot that im wearing this on my back, and have now knocked over this fake inexpensive museum piece]. i asked her if she realized its not good for the bags OR your back to wear them incorrectly and she said the museum is more important than those things. then - with my pack on one shoulder - i said '"oh...ok'" then whipped my backpack around and lightly bumped her on the side, because i forgot it was there! (immature manchild)  ugh. but it is a very nice place. beautiful on the outside and many cool paintings and scultpures. quite resonable entrance fee. great location. they let you take photographs inside. it seems like it would be great for children."<13<12<2018<3<13<2

This is by far the best Filiberto`s in the Phoenix area, I will not eat at any other. The place is clean, food is good, and the customer service is great. Here`s what we usually order:  Chimichanga: it`s the #13 meal comes with a drink,rice, and beans. I usually switch the filling for carne asada or carnitas. That thing is huge! I usually only order it if I`m sharing because otherwise it`s too much. Unless you have a huge appetite, my 18 year old son can down one of those in one sitting without flinching.     Mini street tacos: comes in meal of 5 with a drink. the cabeza here is really good , not too greasy. The tripas are the best, very crunchy with just the perfect amount of chewiness . Anyone who has tried making tripas at home knows they are 1. Expensive. 2. Tedious. 3. They stink up the house. So Filiberto`s is my go to to get my tripa fix.  Carne asada fries: just perfection and generous servings.  California burrito: Also huge and big enough to share but my teens can finish it in one sitting as well.  Rolled tacos: recently discovered they served carne asada flautas. The tortilla is too thick in my opinion but still very good. They drown them in guacamole.  This place is open 24 hours which I love, we are night owls and often find ourselves in the drive thru at midnight. Salsa is not the best but it will do. We have been coming here for years and the employees even recognize us. Don`t forget about the aguas frescas. Mmm horchata!

This is the first company that shows up so I called to make an appointment. They gave me a little detail over the phone but really didn`t ask me too many questions and I showed up for my appointment about 10 minutes early, as they asked so I can fill out paperwork. When I arrived the person at the front desk was too busy talking to another client, I suppose, and never greeted me so I went up to the desk and grabbed my own paperwork and started to fill it out. Shortly after He finished his conversation he asked me if I was there for the 2 o`clock appointment, which I was so I confirmed and I asked him if these papers were all I needed to fill out for the appointment and he confirmed so i finished and handed them back.   A few minutes goes by and another lady comes up to the counter asking the guy at the counter what I`m here for and he states that I was here for a laser hair removal consultation. I interjected that I wasn`t here just for the consultation & I was here for the actual appointment and the lady then stated that everyone has to go to a consultation prior to the appointment which was confirming my suspicion that I was not wanted and was not going to get service here. Another 5 to 10 minutes goes by and the lady that I was suppose to be having the appointment with is still with another client so the lady at the front desk goes and speaks to her and then comes out and tells me that they don`t have the proper equipment for my skin tone. She`s trying to explain to me that the lasers can damage my skin if they were to use them on me but she somehow thinks that negates the fact that you only cater to Caucasian clients & you knew it the second I walked in and still wasted my time.   Then she gave me some information about a particular laser that I needed to check and see if people had. So the next place I call, simplicity laser, I ask if they have this particular laser and they say '" Of course, We`re a laser hair removal company And as all of our clients have different skin tones and issues we have the equipment to cater to any and everyone.'"   So this told me it`s not a common thing for companies to only have one device and this establishment is either stuck in the 40`s or can`t afford the equipment needed to cater to everyone. Either way bad business. DON`T WASTE YOUR TIME or MONEY HERE."<20<5<2019<23<56<26

I didn`t find the food worth it the first time but I`m glad we came again for brunch and gave it another shot; we ordered the PEI Mussels, Eggs Benedict, and Soft Shelled Crab, and we hope all these menus stick around! Flavorful and delicious, the dishes were executed well. I could distinguish now the fancy and refined asian fusion cuisine Cafe Bon Bon is aiming for.   Beef Stroganoff Omurice was delicious, had strong flavours and shareable for two depending. Similarly, Soft Shelled Crab was delicious, I liked the combination of curry and pineapple flavours but smaller portions imo.

Thank goodness the soup was hot, because he was able to warm up his cold grilled cheese by dipping it in the soup. :-/<25<12<2017<2<13<3

We were impressed by everything we ordered. I got vegetarian eggs Benedict (have never found a vegetarian version of this! So I`m excited to order it!) and a chocolate pancake, which was heavenly. I also appreciated that they let you drink some coffee for free while you wait for a table, which would definitely make the wait easier.

Sz3cBepsbYvfMrH54U0ZNw<lm7o7vxW3ath2Gf9Orugmw<xtYiHTmunjfCN2sUaQxBjA<1<1<0<1<What a disaster...let me start at the beginning. After parking in the parking garage, you have to trek across the entire casino and down a level to reach the front desk. Checkin was a chaotic experience. Arriving around midnight after a delayed flight (gotta love Newark!), we arrived at the Rio to a mile-long checkin line. It was moving at a snail`s pace because there were only two people checking people in. There were also kiosks nearby to checkin, but they didn`t appear to be working, and no Rio employees seemed to understand how they even worked. After waiting for over an hour, finally we were able to checked in.   The hotel was dated and slightly run down. With the addition of new, luxurious hotels on the Strip, I feel the Rio is really going to struggle to stay above water. The room was okay, actually quite spacious; however, the decor was dated and the bathtub drain was clogged. We notified housekeeping, but no one did anything.  At checkout, we politely stated our issues when asked how our stay was and if we were satisfied. The woman checking us out didn`t take the feedback well, and said the long checkin time is expected with only two working the desk (is customer experience a concern at all??), and blamed us for telling housekeeping for our clogged drain (apparently, you need to call the front desk). Her tone and approach was abhorrent. Next time I`m in Las Vegas, I will splurge on a room at a new hotel on the Strip and avoid this nonsense.<28<11<2019<20<2<13

forc5ovrvRuvprHQorghUA<TQ9A1LVp6z-fIc494RsLDQ<CA4qhLICQWX0H_bf9iGw0Q<1<15<14<8<"Experiences like this one are the reason I joined Yelp - just so incredibly frustrated by service that I wanted to tell everyone '"Hey, don`t go here unless you have the desire to bend over and take it up the ass.'"  I have more than a few reviews that exclaim my love for my iphone.  If I could melt it on a silver spoon and mainline it, I would.  For various reasons I`ve had seven iphones over the years, three I had to purchase as replacements from the Apple store which is what brought me to this location. The first two replacements I purchased from the Apple store, one in Lancaster, PA and the other from the Apple store at San Tan, both experiences were seamless and literally took under 15 minutes, each time I remember leaving there with a smile on my face because I was so please with my service and my new phone.  Unfortunately, my iphone keeled over and died and I tried to get in to the Apple store at San Tan but they were booked until the next day.  So I decided to go to this location because I couldn`t live without my phone for that long, I was starting to itch.  I made an appointment for 6:00 pm and met with Jorge rather quickly.  I brought my laptop with me so he could help me sync my phone since I could access it, he did.  He left while my phone was syncing and said he`d be back in 45 minutes to check on me.  Um, okay, I guess syncing takes 43 minutes longer at this Apple store than the rest of the world.  He went on to help other people and I waited for him - this set the tone for the rest of the evening, he would come back, look at my phone for a couple of minutes then walk off and help someone else.  Since I spent over an hour there, mainly waiting on Jorge, I had plenty of time to observe the place, this store isn`t as bright an shiny as the other Apple stores I`ve been to, the white walls had scuff marks all over them, the place looked old and used - so did the staff.   There was one guy running around asking people if they needed help and I was like '"damn, I wish I could have gotten him'" but everyone else looked like they were practicing for the 2013 Zombie Walk.    Finally I get my new phone and I was like '"cool, fire it up Jorge'" and he hands it back to me and tells me to activate it and walks off.  This had never happened before, usually the guys are so excited to activate the phone, like they`re bringing a baby unicorn into the world or something, not this dude.  I plug it in go through the prompts and no dice, it wouldn`t activate.  I stand there and wait for him to come back around like I have been all evening and when he does, he tells me that I need to go home and activate my phone and that`s when I hit my breaking point.  I didn`t come down here and wait an hour, spend $170 bucks just to leave with a nonworking phone.  He told me they didn`t set up iphones there.  I called bullshit!  So then he took my phone, walked off to supposedly activate it, came back later and told me it was working.  I grabbed it and left.  He didn`t activate it,  he lied to me, I`m sure I knew that but what was I going to do, cause a big scene and tell him he`s a worthless liar?  Meh  Anyway, I called Verizon when I got home and received the best possible service and they walked me through activating my phone.  You know it`s a cold day in hell when you get better service from Verizon than you do from the Apple store."<28<3<2013<4<21<4

My first experience here, and it was a little awkward at first cause I came early, there was two other people there and no one else. Yet, they sat me right beside them while I waited for my friend to arrive.   I thought this would be another place that charges a lot for sushi and you would only get a few pieces and not be full, meaning you`d have to order a lot. But much to my surprise, we ordered the three dishes and there was plenty to go around.  The volcano special roll was hands down the best, and my favorite dish of the night. They did not skimp out on the salmon and the rice ratio was on par. Mmmmhm delish! The salmon pressed sushi was my least favorite. It had the torched flavor which I enjoy but this sushi, the salmon to rice ratio was off balanced. Way too much rice. Wouldn`t order this again. The last dish was the aburi sampler and there was quite a few different ones to try, a few repeats but we didn`t mind. Good value for price.  Overall 7.5/10 would recommend!<1<12<2019<3<36<43

I made an appointment online for 6 pm, got there a half hour early and was told they couldn`t take me because the online reservations can`t see what`s on the computer at their specific location. Ok, no big deal, stuff happens. The guy said he would be able to take me at 6 the next evening, which was totally fine. So I get there at 6 the next night and there is no appointment for me on their computer. '"We get busy,'" was all they said. No apology. Then they tell me it will take an hour and a half when I was told an hour the day before. But there were already 3 people in the waiting room and I figured if they couldn`t be honest about putting an appointment in the computer they probably weren`t being honest about the wait.

Trina heard me and I thought she had done well. Not even two weeks later, my thumb nail split through the gel! I have a baby and could not get in to tell her, let alone get on here to write a review.

At the North East corner of the Fashion Show Mall on Las Vegas Blvd. - it`s across the street from the Wynn and Encore so there`s a ton of foot traffic. No matter where you sit (it`s all patio seating) you`ll have a great view of Las Vegas`s best!  This burger joint has become of favorite of ours when we`re down on the strip because the food is good, the pricing is fair and the people watching is phenomenal!   We love to use restaurant.com and this happens to be a newer addition to that site that sells out rather quickly each month. The nice thing is they restock the gift certificates at the beginning of each month so if you`re on top of it you can snag one. They have both $10 and $25 gift certificates available. We purchased a $25 one.  We came down to the strip specifically to eat here. We parked just off the strip at Nordstroms and discovered that was quite a walk, however we discovered there`s a parking lot for the mall right behind the restaurant so that will be good to know for next time.  There are so many tasty options here. My boyfriend ordered the Hickory Chicken Sandwich - $9.95, which was awesome! I ordered the Mini Burger Sampler which came with 3 sliders - the Blue Cheese Burger, The Jack Daniels Hickory Bacon Burger, and the Cheddar Burger - $10.95. All were tasty and I added bacon to each of them (for my boyfriends sake, since we end up sharing everything). As an appetizer we LOVE the fried pickles so we ordered the `Threesome` as we usually do - a basket of Onion Rings, Fries & Pickle Fries - $6.95. This comes with a spicy dipping sauce similar to a spicy ranch, we also asked for a side of cheese sauce for the fries - it`s like a melted cheese you`d put on nachos with green and red peppers in it. YUM!  Since we weren`t worried about calories (this meal was all about taste), we also ordered a Fat Tire pint of beer - $5.75 and a Banana Milk Shake (heavenly)-  $4.95. We didn`t come close to finishing even half of our food but wow was it good! We`ll be back soon.  **Side note: they have Happy Hour daily in the bar area from 4-7pm and 11pm - close. $2 Coors Light, PBR & Bud Light drafts.**<11<4<2013<18<55<42

GYQRVO9RhFnMVvZkVupkNg<3vn8tr3TK2oUgaVXLvQ35g<CrjnE2xXPSqz9iHj6nMyWQ<3<3<0<0<TL;DR: Did a fine job of the move, despite being 4+ hours late, but these other reviews are deeply disturbing. The actual movers do great work, but the management is a mess. Recommend avoid.  ---  Reached out to several different moving companies in the Las Vegas area and this one had the most professional response with the best rate, so it was an easy choice to hire them for our move.  However, on the scheduled moving day they arrived over four hours late. No call or text - we actually had to follow up with them to see if they were still coming, and they explained that their previous move was taking longer than usual. Something about a pool table (which must be the other review you can see here on Yelp).  Anyways, when they finally arrived they did a great job with everything. Finished faster than we thought, didn`t damage anything, got everything set up just how we want it in our new place. They were pretty rough with our things, which did make me a bit worried, but at the end of the day nothing was even scuffed or scratched so it all worked out.  The other review written here on Yelp by DeAndre has me VERY concerned, however. As an LGBT couple ourselves, we didn`t feel any kind of homophobia from Sheri or her movers directly, however the screenshot of DeAndre`s text conversation with the owner is all the proof I need. I will absolutely never hire this company again after seeing that, and will encourage others to avoid at all costs.<18<6<2019<18<32<31

I did not hear from the Tempe office. After three days I received a call from the Houston office telling me that a delivery date had been scheduled.

The manger on duty Juan said he didn`t know about the incident and nothing he could do. He would have to talk to the workers on that shift before issuing a refund. I asked if we could at least have a meal since we paid for food we never received and he said no because he wasn`t there so he had to ask staff.

Just make sure to double check the prices as they have 2 separate menus. When you walk towards the glass window where you order there is one menu that has the incorrect cheaper pricing and the one taped in front of the register has the correct prices scratched on it. We had to learn the hard way when we got charged $10 more than what the original menu stated. Other than that the food was great.<30<10<2019<14<55<52

I`m talking very minimal conversation. And  on 10/2/14 he had made a joke about he should start a company where he would spray houses naked I laughed and said I`m sure there`s a market for it he asked me if I wanted to be his first customer I laughed and said sorry I can`t afford it he offered to do it for free I again said no thank you though he asked to use my bathroom he yelled hey you`re out of toilet paper when I walked down the hall to go get toilet paper he was standingIn the bathroom completely naked with a Boner.

Scott and Brendan performed and I have to tell you: THEY ARE AWESOME!  With all that has to be squeezed into the 70 minutes, and with as many times as I am certain they`ve performed the bit, the energy and enthusiasm with which they performed was amazing. The tongue-in-cheek references and fantastic array of puns and improv really make this spectacular!  My teen and I were laughing the entire show, as well as on our drive home as we talked about the shenanigans and the skills that Brendan and Scott exude.  I totally plan to see this at least once more before they leave town. I think my one piece of constructive criticism would be the stage lighting: we sat in the front row and the stage lights from the back of the stage were blaring into our eyes the entire show. Easy fix for next time: sunglasses :)<12<12<2019<15<28<38

The crepe was crispy on top and tender in the middle. The ribs was heated up in the microwave so wasn`t that great.   The place is clean. It has no sits so you can`t chill there.

Vhui81GGxnoA6KJX1A7x2g<xtVfO8oHzZyl54IGoxRu0g<S5-cncQrgWvSLFFWBwtmrQ<5<0<0<0<"We bought a home in Cave Creek and found out only two days before the close of escrow that it was on septic, contrary to the seller`s representation. The seller sent out a guy only to pump and inspect. He asked if we were the buyers or sellers '"because sellers ask me to lie all of the time'"! He told us our leech field had failed and we would probably need a whole new system. We were in a real pickle as we had to close or live in a hotel with four pets! We called several septic companies and got conflicting information about resurrecting the leech field--all temporary fixes. The moment I spoke to Tanya at Septic Medic I knew we found the right company. Dan, the owner of the company was on the property the next day. He spent all of the time we needed to answer every question we had and there were plenty. He then spent several days with his heavy equipment digging perc holes on the lot looking for the best place to install a new leech field---a chore in the hard ground in this area. He then designed our new system keeping in mind how we might use our 1.25 acre lot in the future, something we hadn`t thought of before that. He did this at our request, without knowing if he`d even get paid, as we were not the owners of the property yet. Because we could have no monies held in escrow we demanded that the seller execute a contract with Septic Medic and pay him in full at closing for a completely redesigned new system. Yes, we took a big chance but we knew that our handshake contract was as good as if it was carved in stone. Dan did not disappoint us-- in fact he amazed us. He expedited all of the permits by taking the time to go himself to the county offices and insure the process could be done as quickly and efficiently as possible. Every single thing he told us was exactly as he promised. He updated us daily and treated us like we were his only customers. He has the most respectful, hardworking, and decent young men on his crew--- his sons. They used extreme caution when near our home to prevent damage to the structure---another thing we never even thought of. They went above and beyond to get us '"on line'" ASAP and pumped the existing system several times to insure we could live here right away. They worked non-stop from sunup until sundown.  Dan advised us of a number of remedies for newly discovered plumbing issues that were not septic related which alone saved us a ton of money. He shared his expertise, much to our benefit, on everything including grading issues. The worksite (several deep trenches and holes) was left navigable, clean, and cordoned off every time they left. On top of the challenges our lot had Dan had to work around the gas company that was here on four different days trenching and digging to replace defective lines. He was so accommodating that it looked like a symphony! If I could give Septic Medic ten stars I would. This family owned business is the epitome of honesty, integrity, and know how. Never, in my 25+ years as a real estate broker,  have I met people like this. Oh, a P.S.--- Dan even dug a grave for my precious cat."<5<1<2017<18<58<40
WzffGX60RIVhaALHkBZTTA<MA9Vk5kWob3xB1wRtO5qUQ<s4c_f9WwcolJTNitq2gWpQ<5<2<1<2<Wow! Who would have ever thought that a castle would be in Toronto. Casa Loma is pure beauty and unique which makes its location special and must seen if visiting Toronto. If you are staying in the city, take the train to DuPont which is about a 30 minute train ride. Then it`s like maybe 10 minute walk from the train station to the castle.   I`d recommend going up the stairs and there you can take some beautiful pictures of the castle from the outside. Picture perfect! As you enter the castle, smell the fresh and lovely tulips. Don`t forget to sit by the fountain, make a wish and take more pics.   We arrived on a Sunday about 1PM and didn`t have to wait too long on the line. Tickets were $25 per an adult and $20 for seniors. The price is beyond priceless and so worth it to see this beauty.  As you enter, be sure to go to the basement and check the video out to get a better understanding of the history and beautiful story behind the castle. Take your time and explore each floor and believe me you`ll find yourself speechless with the artifacts left in the castle.  On the first floor, go out on the balcony and take some pictures with the CN tower and Toronto skyline. Absolutely mesmerizing! Sit in the sun and enjoy one scoop of your favorite flavor of gelato. I loved their milky chocolate!   Thereafter, slowly climb up the stairs or use the elevators to explore the meeting rooms, guest rooms, tea rooms, dinning rooms, bedrooms, paintings, sculptures, ornaments and the list goes on.  There is a little wait on the top floor which takes you to the tower.   Enjoy! I can`t wait to visit again with my family!<29<5<2017<21<14<28

It allows young children the freedom to explore and play without parents having to climb the structures with them. But that`s not to say you don`t have to watch your child.   They have a toddler zone for the smaller ones and then a huge enclosed jungle gym with slides galore. My daughter had the biggest smile on her face he entire time.   And the best part? They have a cafe attached to the play zone that has really good food and coffee! You never get both a fun play place for kids and good food for the adults but this is it!

We decided to go have a couple drinks at the bar before being seated.  We ordered 4 mimosas (5 but brother didn`t have his ID) which came out to 50 dollars.  Three of us had seats at the bar and two were standing behind.  We were having a great time but after 15 min of sitting there the bartender/waitress comes up to us and says in a rude tone, '"usually we reserve these spaces for people who are eating, would you move over to the waiting area'".   I understand that it was busy and that she wanted to make more money off of new customers but we had ordered a pretty expensive round of drinks and were waiting to get our table to spend more money on food.  It was quite insulting that they would have the nerve to ask us to leave from the bar.  We did not leave and she grunted and left then proceeded to talk shit to the other bartenders only a few feet from us.   Finally we were seated.  We decided to let go of what had happened and still enjoy ourselves.  When we got our food a manager came up to us.  He rudely started telling us that it is illegal for someone without an id to drink from other peoples drinks (my brother) and that two waitresses had told him this was happening.  My brother had not taken one sip from a drink on the table, beisdes his water.  We tried to explain nicely to him that he had not taken a sip, and the manager started to become extremely rude and not listen. He then began  raising his voice and not only interrupting our breakfast but the other patrons that were sitting on the patio as well.  The food was mediocure and the service was horrendous.  Never going back again.  They did not even comp our meal which had turned into a disaster.  What happened to the customer is always right? These people teamed up against us and main my graduation breakfast a horrible experience."<2<8<2013<5<22<48

My favorite breakfast joint but unfortunately Chip in the plate is non appealing and this presentation in an upscale restaurant is a turn-off.  Which means a cook, a server and our server (after I pointed out the chip and greasy plate)  Were too busy to care about how the food served to me represents their place of business.   I didn`t need the food to be remade. I just think my request that my food at an upscale breakfast restaurant be brought out with a wow-factor-can`t wait-to dive-in-but-must-take-a-picture-first-to remind-me-how-amazing-this-restaurant-is.   Disappointing and honestly,I think reasonably - a just expectation.   Yes We will be back but maybe we might revisit a few of our other favorite breakfast/brunch joints.

Ttbl1y635naExQNtvzalaw<5lrBljPRl1FyNW_GyUXU3A<So1fzEDZ_qcFDhyYd6XG7w<1<4<1<0<"We had the worst experience EVER with this dealership. We bought a brand new Jeep Cherokee Sport - after few hours of having it at home we realized that the driver`s door was not locking . We contacted and took the car back to this dealership....they had to order new parts for A NEW CAR !They called us in less than week later that the part is in for us to come in -we had to wait for their shuttle and basically took a full day ...we came to p/u and they told us that actually only 1 out of 2 parts came in so we have to do this again in a week or two! Every time we went there they had problems finding the car key under our name (we later found out that the car was still registered under their dealership).   We had to go to this dealership 10 x and numberous phone calls, emails and extreme stress .... every time we got there to p/u our '"fixed'" new car -something else was wrong with it (cabin lights were not working, gas tank was not opening etc).  Finally they said that it is all done (after over 1 month going back and forth)we got there only to find out that the car was back to square one-with the same problem we dropped the car off with !!!  They were clearly struggling fixing this faulty car and chose not to give us a refund or to give us another car -as this car was still under their dealership name and was not registered under ours yet. This time they kept the car for full 3 weeks ! We finally got Our BRAND New car - which needed a number of new parts ordered and help from the Chrysler`s technician . Fianlly after almost 7 weeks we received our Brand new-fixed car!  The magament and the owner are not professional AT ALL ! They are so fake -they just want to sell you a car -pretending that you are '"like their  family'". I would never ever reffer anyone to this dealership...they are wasting everyone`s time !  This is our 2nd new car we bought here -we had no real issue with the 1st car so never had to deal with the management only with the mechanics- but this time it was the Worst experience to deal with the owner and the management at this dealeship.There is ABSOLUTELY NO CUSTOMER SERVICE !

aIzGoUE_jLLmVP61yYQbCw<39NESxGn0uwSromJ8urFRA<4cHSwhkKBAe4LeuPRp_Mxg<5<4<1<1<Disclaimer: I`ve NEVER done dance, gymnastics, aerial arts, pole dancing, OR pilates. And yet, I am somehow now absolutely IN LOVE with and exclusively going to Be Studios for aerial dance, pilates reformer, and yoga. I went to my first class with a group of friends 6 months ago, and have been going back 3 - 4 times/week ever since.  Summary: Atmosphere: You know that friend who is somehow ALWAYS able to throw these amazing parties that are FULL of laughter when you need them to be, or relaxing as shit when needed, OR intense when needed??? Those friends are the best. This is how I think of Be Studios. You walk into an entry room full of smiling employees chattering with other members, softly burning incense, and an energy that makes you happy.  Instructors: All of the instructors are (usually) here for the RIGHT reasons - They all hang out after class and chat, they all put 110% into the class, and they are all knowledgeable, creative, and skilled. I give more details on who I recommend you go to below.  Class Size: Be Studios keeps all of the classes pretty small (6 - 8 ppl) and this makes a HUGE difference. You get lots of personal attention. I REALLY hope they don`t change this as they expand...  Pricing: Kinda expensive for a membership. However, I`ve gotten a Groupon deal, as well as 2 unlimited month deals  Recommendations: - I absolutely ADORE doing Pilates Reformer, Aerial and Lyra all in tandem - It gives you an UNBELIEVABLY well-rounded muscle-toning schedule  But not everyone likes to work out the way I do..... - If you want efficient muscle building/toning: Go to Pilates Reformer and go with Linda.   - If you want to learn a new skill and build muscle/abs/skills over an extended amount of time: Go to Aerial or Lyra. It takes MONTHS, actually YEARS, to get good at these, but the challenge will keep you coming  - If you want to do yoga: Do Yoga and Tea (on Sundays) - I LOVE THIS CLASS! Wanida is an AMAZING instructor - she has an epic playlist which goes from softer to louder and slower to faster as the intensity of the class builds up. She uses amazing essential oils, and gives GREAT instructions. Then you get to have tea as a class! This is my FAVORITE yoga class in Cleveland  If you want cardio, Be Studios, in my opinion, won`t provide that fully (which is totally fine)... - I get ALL of my muscle toning and flexibility at Be Studios. my cardio workouts OUTSIDE of Be Studios. This place is largely about muscle building/toning and fun!  Instructors: - Pilates Reformer: I definitely recommend Linda, but her classes book up pretty far in advance.  - Aerial / Lyra:  In my opinion, everyone who is not an advanced gymnast should start with Rachel - Go to Rachel for 1 - 3 months (Depending on comfort level) until going to Emily`s classes. Rachel is a VERY good teacher - she`s clear, patient, hands-on and VERY motivating/inspirational.  Emily is an AMAZING athlete and can really inspire you to train harder. She is more advanced and sometimes, as a result, it`s harder for her to clearly explain the basics of moves to the class, because they are so intuitive to her. She does moves pretty quickly and then moves on. That being said, I really do genuinely LOVE both of their classes now that I`m a bit more comfortable.<9<7<2018<15<12<14

The noodles are made fresh daily and you can observe through a window fantastic skills that it takes as the chef prepares the noodles. There are many different types and sizes of noodles that you can choose and different broths and stir fries that they can be used in. Be aware that this is a very small Eatery and the lines can be quite long. I got the  spicy Szechuan beef brisket noodle which the waiter recommended as being their most popular noodle dish. It was quite full of beef flavor and the beef just literally melted in your mouth. The noodles have the right consistency a little chewy, a little give, and slightly al dente...perfect for a cold Las Vegas evening. Talk about comfort food!!I will keep coming back to this place.<4<11<2019<16<49<21

Not to be dramatic, but I have never really had a less-than-mediocre experience at a gas station before; let alone a bad one! How does this even happen? I will tell you..   First of all, you can`t pay with two cards for the same bill.  Secondly, don`t go at night at all costs. Jagir works the night shift for a reason.   Now about Jagir. The following experience is numbered to point out all the ridiculous things surrounding my experience with this employee: 1) This man was too flustered by trying to conduct a transaction with two cards. 2) When he couldn`t figure it out, he actually asked if I had another card I could use.. Clearly not..(?).. 3) After he attempted to start over, it seemed to charge all of it on one card, and then said '"I don`t know what to tell you.'" 4) And actually shoo-ed me away with his hand and looked at the next customer in line. Disrespectful. Which there was no line when we began, if you can imagine how long this took; it formed a line.  After being rudely shunned and disrespected at the register, I just walked out and tried to pump my gas. Since he charged the whole thing to one card, accidentally; but now that I think of it, it was probably on purpose.   5) However, nothing is on the pump. I had to go BACK IN and he told me he had just '"cancelled everything'". Yep, this guy basically told me to get lost. But I still needed gas, so I told him I just wanted half of what I originally wanted (Since thats all I could put on one card).   6) He had the nerve to LAUGH AT ME. I stood up for myself verbally, but geez. Why do people like this work in customer service? Go stock shelves or something, damn!   All in all, it`s pretty hard to actually have a bad experience at a gas station, but this place makes it convenient! If you want bad service for an unreasonable amount of time, stop in and see Jagir tonight! This crappy experience just can`t be beat.  - Truthfully, if you have a competent cashier, you may be fine. You`ve been warned."<20<11<2019<7<14<34
sxfdNiC63Z1bRMr8kDCVAg<nD_QsYDp_5me5i5G0jImGQ<V4yV2MCLbvdEFT_ggi35Xg<1<4<3<0<My Step-Daughter loves Tiffany sterling silver jewelry.  God help, I have NO idea why.  I usually buy it online, but thought I`d give it another shot after a previously bad experience a number of years ago.  Let me suffice it to say, it`s hard to be glamorous in a cast, wearing the most comfy clothing you can because of said cast, so I was just dreading this visit.  Walked in through the `spensive crap and into the silver area crap.  There were two sales women, or rather, one woman, one semi-woman (girl).  The woman was helping another customer, the young girl standing around.  Did not greet me, did not make eye contact and basically turned her back to pretend I wasn`t there.    Needless to say, I scanned the cases for awhile, waiting for assistance or SOME acknowledgement that I was there.  Nope.  Nothing.  Nada.    I`m done buying this crap jewelry for my step-daughter.  Not one more penny is going to this company from either me or her father.  There is much better quality to be found in smaller, mom and pops jewelry stores as well as online.  incidentally, I found a beautiful sterling silver necklace with her baby daughter`s birthstone.  She`s going to love it!  By the way, little girl who ignored me...my wedding ring alone is worth more than you`ll make in 5 years!  My guess, had you noticed my ring, you would have been all over me.  I purposely keep my ring turned when I walk into jewelry stores because it draws attention.  I want attention as a customer, not because I have a wedding ring that wouldn`t ever be sold in your store because it is one of a kind.    Dang, Tiffany`s has turned me all hoity-toity.  *evil laugh*<6<12<2013<21<59<54

To start the service was decent and the food wait time was reasonable. The burnt end poutine overall flavor was pleasant and a good start to our dinner, but the burnt end itself was not the best that I have had. We ordered the hog burger and hells` kitchen burger for main. Both burgers` temperatures were accurate, but flavors weren`t all that amazing. We had onion rings as well and that tasted like old grease, so we just left it alone. The oreo creme brulee shake was good and is definitely made for those with a sweet tooth.  Overall, it is just not worth the visit when factoring in the price. I am happy that I tried it, but I would venture to other food locations next time visiting Vegas instead.<26<11<2019<7<14<39

We wanted to get some brunch and decided to come here based on previous yelp reviews and distance from our hotel. We had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated because the restaurant was packed, but I like the system they use of texting you when your table is ready. Our server was attentive, especially considering how busy it was in there. I ordered a decaf cappuccino with almond milk and the Bella Bella Benny. I`ve never had eggs Benedict like that before, and it may be hard for me to have it any other way. The eggs were perfectly poached with hollandaise sauce and a balsamic drizzle. Rather than the typical English muffin, the eggs were on toaster ciabatta, and a hash brown patty was on the side. Delicious! My friends also tried the juevos rancheros and the lemon poppyseed pancake. We all raves about how good the food was, and it was the perfect brunch place for our last day in Houston.<6<8<2018<18<41<55

Cliff has take great care of us and at no point we felt rushed to make a decision. He showed us probably close to a dozen cars and we`ve driven a couple that we liked,  but were torn so have not pulled the trigger that day and agreed to come back after a few days (had a short vacation trip planned). Coming back, we`ve looked at few more cars and eventually settled on one. Again, Cliff was very accommodating and let us spend as much time as we needed inspecting each car and weighing options. It`s also worth noting that HLG`s website offers quick way to access each car`s CarFax and window sticker, so we were able to see exactly what options are included (and all cars we have looked at had spotless CarFax). Long story short, after we have settled on a car, it didn`t take much time to fill out paperwork and find the best financing option for a smooth '"closing'". So far (fingers crossed) I highly recommend HLG and Cliff in particular."<23<10<2019<20<13<19

Their secretaries seem to think they are above you as well as the attorneys. They are deceitful and in humane. I am glad that there have been a few people who have been treated well by this law firm but it was probably because you raised no questions or showed no signs of doubt. If they can get you to agree the will take all your money`s worth. I would never trust this law firm and I hope everyone that is considering  takes this as a warning and DOES NOT go. They took my money and left me with absolutely zero results. They are all talk and lies.<30<8<2014<2<33<14

I was here to celebrate a friend starting a new job. A party of 6 without reservations on a Sunday afternoon we had to wait for seating on the patio for about an hour. Not unexpected and it was a gorgeous afternoon to just hang out and chat.  The patio seating was worth the wait. Service was a little slow as the place was packed. I had the Tuscan Tuna panini which was really good and also filling. I did not hear any complaints about the food in our group. I would definitely go back here.<28<4<2019<15<54<16

Was given the menu and the drink menu.   This restaurant was originally a food truck that has now expanded with a brick and mortar.   Opted for the House Breakfast & Breakfast Bowl, and a Belching Beaver PB beer. Nothing disappointed in the least. Everything was very on point. And honestly Im still confused that a beer can actually have a Peanut Butter aroma and taste.   Interior was several tables, music, televisions playing in the background, and a pretty neat mural of sausages partying on the wall. There is merchandise for sale as well.   This restaurant is located in an area that some might find questionable, due to the surrounding buildings ect.... However just do it.   Would def recommend- pricing is reasonable   Location is Sahara / Maryland Pkwy-  ample parking<14<10<2019<15<55<2

After months of back and forth, with no explanation of why it still hasn`t been installed or ordered, and of having to physically show up at the dealership because they weren`t returning calls, they tell me the part had since been discontinued and they weren`t able to install what they were contractually obligated to provide with the sale of the vehicle.   Now they`re not returning any calls and are refusing to take accountability for a part that should have been ordered and guaranteed in stock before they sold me a vehicle under a false promise.<18<5<2018<21<15<52

There`s mostly seating outside in the park but there is some seating inside. Mostly it`s just a walk-up bar though. Great customer service and it`s a plus they don`t use plastic straws! The frosé is super sweet and delicious. They also have a new Cali Creamin` Creamsicle beer... delicious! They won`t share the recipe for their super secret frosé, we tried. But hey, can`t blame `em!   I didn`t check out the food menu but there are some options for bites. The only downside is this place being so tiny but that`s kind of the whole container park vibe anyways. If you want to walk around with your drink, just let them know and you`ll get a plastic cup if you have glass.<3<11<2019<19<1<1

We decided to try them one night for dinner, and the gal at the register was very helpful in guiding us through the menu.  The owner was there as well, and he was very welcoming and warm. The restaurant is decorated in a very cute way and all of their in-house materials are well designed, simple, and easy to understand.  I had the chicken mole enchiladas, which were very good! The refried black beans were a little bland, but the rice was good. My wife had the green enchiladas, which I tasted and they were excellent! They had a wonderful tart tomatillo sauce.  The meals were served in this little paper basket, which wasn`t really easy to eat out of, but it didn`t degrade the quality of the food at all, which was excellent.   We`ll definitely go back and try some other menu items as the place is very cute and the food is super tasty!<26<10<2019<18<26<48

VM8EpKcRVXkk-FLl7YvDRg<Gab1_sLsjJLAJojoFd-d-g<rioQ_p2pILNbJ4Xp5jW6-Q<2<1<1<1<Two stars mostly for the terrible parking situation.  Sorry, but I don`t want to pay $1 for half an hour of parking !  The City of Las Vegas really screwed up allowing this place to be built.  It seems to be just a method to increase cash flow to the city by collecting parking fees and writing tickets.    Inside.  A few small shops.  There is not much for sale there.  Two candy shops.  Some restaurants.  A kettle corn shop.  A jerky & spice shop.  Some knick-knack shops.  A bar or two.  A bathing suit place.  Flip-Flop store.  Small clothing shops.  It`s not laid out well.  There`s an elevator on one side, but there`s no bridge to connect the upstairs on both sides so you`d need to go downstairs to go to the other side.  The little play area in the middle is nice.  The place has potential if they can add to it and get some real stores in the neighborhood and then add some free parking.  I don`t see this place lasting long unless they solve the parking situation.<4<3<2016<1<40<46

yOErGc3_35J5iZZNuVbdNg<-P-sh4_My1WShW8oIw3FXw<VsvDBjN46z8lur9hvyYIww<5<0<0<0<On Thanksgiving weekend, my fiancé and I took a trip to Vegas from LA. I made an appointment with Bowties Bridal Outlet beforehand and went in with an open mind. I showed Christine a couple images from my Pinterest account and we both selected some dresses to try on.   The first one I tried on was Christine`s choice. I fell in love with the details - the pearl buttons, Swarovski crystals, low illusion back, and lace train. It hugged my curves (in all the right places)! Finding out it was a Maggie Sottero solidified that it was my dream dress. None of the other dresses I tried on afterward compared to how I felt about this one. However, it was out of my budget.   I left the appointment empty handed and told my fiancé that I couldn`t stop thinking about it. He said if it was my dream dress, then we would make it work somehow. I did my homework and called a couple of bridal shops around LA. To my surprise, the dress retailed at TWICE THE AMOUNT Bowties Bridal offered it for.   We called Christine back a couple days later and she was so gracious in helping to reserve the dress. This past weekend, I drove back up to pick the dress up with my parents. THANK YOU BOWTIES FOR HELPING TURN MY VISION INTO A REALITY!   For brides that are looking for their wedding gown, look no further. They have a great selection of designer dresses at amazing prices. If you can, I highly suggest making an appointment. They`ll take good care if you.<10<12<2019<19<29<31

You can tell they love their material and still enjoy it. I wonder how many shows they have already done. They really didnt leave anything out. They made jokes about the inconsistencies with in the series that I have never even thought of. These guys are quick on their feet especially the guy who had to change into different characters!! The venue was small and it kept the intimacy. My favorite part was the crowd interaction. I was like a little kid excited to hit the ball.

6hL9NADufdMXpUEQVOaucw<WJKocp9RE0KatUwh3_DkGg<BW7SzVRTV1lZOYGrwuVSEA<1<14<5<4<"This place manages to have worse customer service than both the MVD and Walmart, which is pretty impressive.  The lack of customer service coupled with world class apathy- makes me cringe. My experience has truly astonishing and I look forward to finding a different provider, ASAP.  Long story short, I need routine respiratory supplies, and they are supposed to be mailed on a quarterly basis. For some reason in June I didn`t get my supplies, but being super busy and working 60-80 hours a week, I didn`t have time to call them. Flash forward to Sept (give or take) and I called asking where my items were. I was told that there was a computer glitch and my new address wasn`t the one being used for mailing. No problem, things happen- they said they would fix it and send over what I needed.  Fast forward to October, and I still don`t have the stuff. I continue to make do with my old stuff, and then remember to call Valley Respiratory and ask what`s up. The person there was nice and said that she didn`t know why I didn`t get my order, it was never shipped- but she would send it out. I never got that shipment either, but with the busy holidays I didn`t get a chance to call until Nov/Dec. I again spoke with an employee who said she would mail it out, and also let me know that in Jan I would start receiving my stuff three months worth at a time. I never received anything until the end of Dec, when I got the three months supply that is for Jan-March. I have no idea what happened from June-Dec, but eight months passed without supplies, and all the while my insurance company was being billed, and they paid for supplies I never received.  I called today and spoke with a nice RT, who put me on hold, and a new person, whom I presume was a supervisor spoke with me. This person was very condescending and essentially shit all over me. It`s worth noting that I am very laid back and I don`t get upset or yell, or any other douchey behavior. I can`t help but see that people who tantrum get more when they encounter these situations, but that`s not me, so I tried to explain what happened and asked her to mail me my supplies, that were still missing since June. This woman was clearly annoyed and said that I should have called them and told them about the problem. I reminded her that I had called several times since June, and was still waiting. The woman told me that '"normal people'" call sooner, and that I had a month from the time they were supposed to ship it, to call and advise them that I never got the package. I am unsure how I am supposed to know when they are sending me things, when  they are eight months late in sending me my last supplies. Perhaps I should employ a psychic? I asked her how they could bill my insurance for things that I never receive, and she essentially said that they don`t know I didn`t receive them. So now I am a liar too, which is nice.    All in all, I don`t think you should have to micro-manage a company who is supposed to have their act together. Mistakes will happen, and that`s ok, but when a mistake does happen, don`t treat your customers like shit, and tell them that they are doing it all wrong. The bigger issue is that when I am telling them I never received the shipment, I am told that it must have been stolen. I told her that since I hadn`t received my supplies in 8 months, a more likely scenario is that they never sent it, but she said that it had been sent. So miraculously, all my Amazon.com packages were safe from the roving thieves pillaging my neighborhood, but a small, light box from them was stolen? Uhh, ok- that makes sense.  To recap, it`s forgivable to mess up shipping something, but it is unforgivable to treat a customer so poorly, and to bill for items that were never shipped or received. I highly recommend you go elsewhere, save yourself headaches, time, and energy."<15<1<2014<3<43<24

After buying Gold passes and drink plans for a family a 5 and meal plan for 1 because I`m not rich, LoL! it was still cheaper than a week at Disney. The waterpark, Carolina Harbor kept my family plenty busy during the summer and we enjoyed it. That wave pool was the favorite. Life jackets are provided for FREE and I think required for the little ones and the guards on duty were very attentive.  I`m not much for rides anymore but the kids took advantage of Camp Snoopy and loved it. I will say that the level of customer service around the park is wayyyy better in the later months than the summer. Maybe it`s the heat. No watery drinks and cold food. We recently returned for their Pumpkin Fest and we had fun. The weather was perfect and standing in a line isn`t so bad.

The staff was really helpful and friendly and the prices were great!   We live in the Palm Springs area and we`ve been raving about this place to our families and friends. Today we actually drove four hours to take our friends to TLC. They immediately loved the decor and ambiance, i read another review from someone that said '"they got sore eyes from the decorations and found it offensive'" which is total BS. As a true 100% Mexicano I love how it looks and it brings me the feels because it reminds my pueblo.   We went all out and got a flan agua sucia, mazapán agua sucia, horchata agua fresca, café de olla, café de Frida, my friend also can`t have no sugar so the staff made her two specialty drinks to satisfy her needs and she loved them! Well we loved ALL the drinks. We again had a blast, the staff made the experience a whole lot better, the manager Luisa even came to our table to talk to us (She`s amazing! Stop by and say hi to her!)  before our drive back to Palm Springs we got a couple more drinks for the road and a bunch of Pan dulces to share with our friends and family back home.

She quickly told me I could sit down and she would try to find some one that could speak to me. I walked right out. Im sure the doctor is great with the reviews but im sorry. Im not sitting in a packed office building for '"someone'" to talk to me when I can go online and find another practice. They are a dime a dozen in Henderson."<26<9<2013<23<1<52
4s4FHsp3_KVX8PB0LHQjkw<NQBQj7tHxETHf4PDkAtKUA<w2tr0PA0b3tg8pId0kjM-A<2<2<2<1<I stopped in here after a trip to Sq hill to pick up a few things just looking for a small dessert. On walking in I was greeted (that`s always a plus to me) this place is pretty tiny and doesn`t feel very welcoming as a sit down place. I`m not a big fan of macaroons but they did offer a lot of other stuff to suit whatever it is you may be looking for. This place is definitely a bit high for a small dessert but the presentation looks nice as it sits on the shelf. I settled on a slice of the tiramisu-Ish  lopera cake. Now the thing that was most upsetting to me is the lady asked if I wanted it for here or to go and I said for here and it seems they use the same package regardless if how you want it. You would think with wanting to sit down and eat something they would use a plate instead of a flimsy cardboard box and save on paper products. It was awkward sitting down and opening it up to eat off it as a plate with a plastic spoon but it is what it is. The flavor profiles where decent it wasn`t dry and was nice and moist and dense and I like that, the chocolate it`s self in the cake didn`t taste fake or cheap like a lot of places do and actually had a rich taste to it and not bitter. It wasn`t anything to rant about or really stand out tho over any other pastry shop. Overall I doubt I`ll be returning here again because it`s something I can do without.<2<6<2019<13<42<8
di5RT3-HTT3osQ6aYSTalw<FtTUcQhsOwSEUXGEiMidtg<Xp_cWXY5rxDLkX-wqUg-iQ<4<2<0<0<Four and a half stars from me!  I was a frequent visitor to the old Brennan`s.  Usually I would try all the free samples, then buy one or two things.  My favorites were the cheese spread and the sweet and hot dip.  When my wife needed gift baskets for her job, I went crazy and bought a ton of stuff.  My understanding is that the new Brennan`s is supposed to have a smaller produce department, the same cheese department, and a bigger deli/sandwich counter.  Produce dept was very much smaller, probably 1/8 of the previous store, but still had quality produce with plenty of samples.  I very rarely bought produce from Brennan`s-- usually only the boxes of peaches.    The cheese department looked similar except the cheese samples were cut MUCH smaller-- more like cheese crumbles.  I understand trying to cut costs, but I had trouble spearing any of them with my toothpick.  Maybe a happy medium?  The selection looked similar.  I did not see the old version of cheese spread, but did see the sweet and hot dip.  I didnt look in depth at the deli counter, but that was because there were several people purchasing.  It seemed very popular.  I did try two sandwiches.  The Cuban was a full on win.  It was as good a Cuban as I`ve found in Wisconsin (tied, or maybe slightly edged out, by TBBQJ`s).  It`s been a decade or so since I`ve been in Miami but all the flavors tasted correct.  The Italian Beef was different than I was expecting.  They used shredded beef instead of sliced, on garlic bread, with their own twist on sweet/hot peppers/giardiniera.  The best thing about it was the bread, which held up well to being dipped.  The gravy was also very flavorful.    Looking forward to going back and trying the Bucky Basil, which they tell me is one of their most raved about sandwiches.  EDIT:  I tried the Bucky Basil.  Definitely one of their top sandwiches, tied with the Cuban.  I like the beef even less now when compared to these other two!<17<10<2018<19<29<55

She was so attentive and even took a moment to acknowledge our kids and ask questions about them to get to know us better.

Good ambiance and good music. As far as the food, that`s a different story. The tacos hardly had any meat and the tortillas were under cooked. The rice was stale. One word of advice would be to shut down the basketball game during dining hours or move that table because we could not eat comfortably with little kids shooting basketballs over our heads.

I have probably cracked about 7 phone screens so I can say that I have probably called just about every phone repair shop in Vegas looking for the best price. When a friend of mine noticed that my phone was broken he said i should go to Tech Tech because they use the best quality parts and have the best prices in town. I was pretty set on where I wanted to go but I decided to give Tech Tech a chance. From now on I will only go to Tech Tech!!! I thought I already found the lowest price in Vegas so I was shocked when I payed $48 dollars less for a full screen replacement at Tech Tech. I was already happy to hear that I was going to pay $48 dollars less than the cheapest place I found and then I heard them say that I would have my phone back in 2 hours and not next day like the other place I previously went to. They are super friendly and they even offered me a loaner phone until my phone was fixed. When you need a phone repair Tech Tech is the best!!!<2<11<2015<16<19<4

We went on Thanksgiving and bought a 65` Samsung tv for $479 and a cart add on for a hoverboard which was $69 and paid half cash and half on a credit card. I went back the next day to return cart add on only and lady at customer service was lazy she just put it back on my card without asking or even looking at my receipt to see what forms of payment I used.When I told her I preferred cash back she said she couldn`t because she could only do what the computer tells her to do...Now I previously worked in retail customer service for over 8 years so I knew that was bs and that was horrible customer service. Later I called to speak to her store manager which told me his name was Chris and later told my husband a different name he was worse they both had no knowledge of targets official return policy which say if you use multiple forms of payment you may receive your refund across all forms of payments used ,he tried to say that he could only put it back on our card also until I put my husband on the phone then he says oh yeah just come in and well charge your card again then refund you in cash. This is the worst customer service and from the employees in the store that should be giving the best customer service. The only reason I`m giving three stars is because of the three employees on the floor that were great and gave us exceptional customer service. Target really needs to train their customer service and management a whole lot better. This experience has made me not want to shop at target.<13<12<2019<6<56<56

There was mold in the apartment because the upstairs unit had some sort of flood and it was unlivable for about a week (there was an industrial sized fan up there to dry the unit out) and no one offered to provide hotel accommodations when it smelt so bad we couldn`t stay there for three nights,  another situation was the air conditioning started leaking and also had mold but the management didn`t offer accommodations while the place aired out, my roommates car was broken into, someone stole the registration stickers off of my vehicle, someone hit my vehicle badly under paid covered parking and didn`t leave a note, someone stole tennis shoes off the front porch, I found bullets in the washing machine, plan b in the parking lot, people have been stealing from the washing machines so everyone is paranoid to do laundry, a homeless person I see loitering every week tried breaking into my apartment, a kid committed arson on three different patios and my house was smoked out, I deal with liter on the daily from the upstairs neighbors smoking and their kids` polar pop cups/ candy wrappers/ debris, I get to listen to the 15 people living in that 2 bedroom unit run around/shout/drop stuff/ take 5 hour long showers (yes the pipes are that loud) all hours of the day, my apartment smells like cigarettes and weed from the upstairs neighbors, the upstairs neighbors leave their children unsupervised and/or lock them out when they come home from school so I have to listen to them beat the literal shit out of each other and say things like '"you`re the reason mom isn`t here'" It`s depressing seeing these kids live in such bad conditions, there`s cat fesses EVERYWHERE and when it rains the complex smells like a crap. A cat gave birth on my front porch, they also left a dead bird (of course the complex wouldn`t clean it up they said '"uhhh why can`t you clean that up?'"), and congregated at my door so I was basically stuck, cops are here every single week because this is a hot spot for crime and lots of drugs. I`ve had to call the cops WAY too many times for domestic abuse and criminal activity. Lease agreements with regards to included/not included charges have changed multiple times without renegotiation. The pools are locked the majority of the year (no one sends out emails telling how long either) and the hot tub was colder than the actual pool until July lololololol.   If you`d like photos of anything listed above, I can provide them.   The maintenance people here are extremely nice and sympathetic. Management is very bad. BH is garbage. You just can`t make this stuff up. SURPRISINGLY it`s not just a bunch of college kids that cause all these community issues, it`s really a bunch of classless adults.

The dentist was trying to talk me into more x-rays, to determine what kind of teeth cleaning to be done. Just crazy ! I am 68 years old. I have been having my teeth clean twice a year for most of my life ! I know teeth cleaning and how it works ! So because (we) would not have extra x-rays done, the dentist would not do our  teeth cleanings. If (We) were experiencing or having any dental problems, we would be having them addressed. All we (wanted), was to have our teeth cleaned but what this dental practice wanted was to get you to get more services done to make more money ! NOT RIGHT and SHAME on this practice. FYI, we called our dentist back in Ohio and told him what we had experienced and our dentist said, '"Did you leave'" the practice? we said ,YES, we did. Our back home dentist said, GOOD FOR YOU ! BEWARE people ! read comments on YELP ! these people were right about this practice but we wanted to find out for ourselves and we did !"<15<6<2017<18<9<37

The day of my appt however, I was asked to come 30min later than scheduled. I still had to wait and because I had to get home I almost had to skip the cut. It was all crammed in but I missed the massage and fun stuff and still ended up with a 300+ bill. She did an okay job w colour but the cut was not what we discussed in the consultation. No hard feelings, I just want to go somewhere where the stylist does not say '"what`s your name again?'" while I am waiting for her or come back from break smelling like cigarettes to work on my hair (personal preference , I know some people dont care about that, but I do). I am sure this is a great place, but it just didn`t make me want to come back. I felt like an afterthought."<16<7<2019<18<22<50

chbHC0K0e3u7rDNsZdsU5A<kD_FScl4YPpVFjN03GW2Cg<EIFW8Cz9S7-jWWdnZrH3pg<4<1<0<0<Overall 4 stars for the value friendly staff and adequate customer service during this lunch buffet dining experience.  Realistically on any buffet offerings are going to vary in terms of quality taste flavor and presentation. The casino grand view Buffay generally sticks to that rule.  There are many stations to pick from that cover different cuisines from brunch items to American to Asian fusion to barbecue to Italian to tex mex flare two salads and assorted desserts.  The view from the restaurant lounge can be spectacular on a beautiful sunny day since the patio balcony overlooks the Ohio River and the hills off the opposite sure which provides a nice elegant escape from city noise and concrete jungles.  Overall the staff is pretty friendly and attentive. There were a couple of instances where my drink wasn`t refilled for a while and I kind of at that moment wished they had self-serve fountain drink stations similar to the ones they have on the casino grounds which would make it easier for someone like me who gobbles beverage faster than average person.  For about 16 bucks with drinks and tax included , tip not included , this is considered to be of good value.   In comparison to other casino buffets in this region and trust me I have tried them all , this one in Pittsburgh definitely wins over the two others: in Cleveland horseshoe casino and also Columbus Hollywood casino , both of which lacked value, quality and attention to details.<27<10<2019<18<2<52

So I turned to handy-dandy Yelp and did a quick search. Free Bail Bonds was one of the first companies to pop up, so I decided to give them a call. They offer free consultations, so there`s no need to feel any pressure.   Based of the charges my friend was facing, Allen at Free Bail Bonds advised me that this is something that will not be beneficial using a bail bondsman for. I appreciated the honesty and transparency so I didn`t have to jeopardize my finances or a friendship. Ask for Allen if you had any questions about bailing someone out. He was very informative and friendly.<16<9<2019<16<47<34

The food was affordable especially for a lunch buffet that affords many options. I tried almost everything- from the butter chicken to the vada to the chicken korma to the chili chicken. There was nothing complicated- just good Southern Indian cuisine. I highly recommend it if you are going out for lunch and would like a quiet place to enjoy Indian cuisine and not have to pay an arm and a leg.<27<11<2019<19<5<11

I ordered delivery from here once when I was on campus studying. It took them about an hour to get it to me at UNCC (half a mile away). After dropping off the food, I realized they never gave me a fork or anything to eat with. I called them and asked if the driver could swing back by with a fork, and the lady informed me that they only give forks when they deliver to businesses and hotels (because plastic forks are SOO expensive!). I asked if they could bring one out anyways (again, I`m half a mile away,) and she asked if I could go to another restaurant nearby to get one. I was studying for a final exam ON CAMPUS and couldn`t leave, which is why I ordered DELIVERY, and she asks if I could leave to get a fork somewhere else... No, but I can go somewhere else and get food from now on.<2<2<2013<2<10<28

He again asked '"how can I help you?'".  I again said, more slowly this time, '"what is your address?'" Then he said '"don`t talk to me like that'" and hung up! WOW, how rude. We turned around and went to another place for breakfast. Judging by all the recent negative reviews and comments about the rude behavior of the management  (owners?) this must be a common practice here.

OjMQg601BE1QfoM1XHM4bw<kCtbf9i5vEqPXQjw6rq_DQ<Cy6HvDPRvFfHZcci_7LglA<5<0<0<0<Update: Wii Play Games has renovated again!  This time, they updated the video games section.  It is now more roomy and organized than before.  Makes it feel like a new store in there now.  I don`t know if they got a lot of new inventory or not, but it feels like it.  I`ve been in many times since I reviewed it and a couple of times since the newest renovation and I`ve seen stuff in there now that I`ve not noticed before.  They seem to have a lot more collectibles now, or have at least reorganized them so they are more noticeable.   They`ve also really improved the layout of the behind the counter stuff so that I feels more accessible and easier to see.  I used to be disinclined to ask them to show me stuff from behind the counter before, but now it seems more like they want you to check that stuff out since it is easier to see.  They`ve also been doing more price tagging in the video game section so you don`t have to ask how much stuff is as much as you used to.    The staff is still quite friendly and knowledgeable.  I`m glad to report that that hasn`t changed.  As much as I like the two Game Stops in our area (down by the South Walmart and the other up in Charleston Commons), I still try to get my games here first to support my local businesses and for their great customer service.  I only go to Game Stop now when Wii Play Games doesn`t have what I`m looking for which isn`t very often.  I even told the girl at our south Game Stop last time I was in there about how good Wii Play Games is with having more selection of Nintendo games in stock.  She was new and didn`t know about it yet, so I suggested that she recommend it when people come in looking for the classic games (which Game Stop doesn`t sell in-store anymore).  If Wii Play Games had as good of a warranty on consoles as Game Stop does, I`d probably quit going to Game Stop altogether.<10<9<2018<23<45<2

aooff9BngXoSzUbW35Z0qQ<IXcOuIHqcKq_gWqX7-aMsQ<51-j6MOP2NvVQo6y1bYuxQ<4<2<1<3<We discovered the Lakewood location of Bottle House Brewing Company early in the summer and have returned several times. We were thrilled with the delicious and unique craft beer and ale selection-mostly their own brews. Everything we tried was delicious. It is so refreshing to go to a place that offers something other than the standard craft drafts that every other establishment offers. The bartender was welcoming and extremely knowledgeable about his products. I had never tasted mead, so tried one of those as well after the bartender answered my many questions on what it was and how it tasted. We ate there the first time we visited and our meals were both excellent. However, the menu is currently limited and they hope to expand it in the near future.  The owners need to do a website for this location (like the one they have for the Cleveland Heights location) because right now it is a hidden treasure in Lakewood and not easy to find with on-line searches. It`s on the corner of Chesterland and Madison. If you like unique, craft brews and meads, you will love this place. I give it 5 stars for the brews, bartender and background music and hope to add another star once they get their menu worked out.<16<9<2016<13<13<52

Location:  inside Bellagio hotel but a long walk from the main entrance.    Atmosphere:  dark wood decor and quite dark inside.  The space is also super loud, made it hard to hear even in a booth for 3 people.    Price:  we`re at the Bellagio for a conference and wanted a decent dinner place that`s not too expensive to enjoy with colleagues.  This was listed as $$$ (vs $$$$ for high end).  Well,  a few appetizers were prices at decent value but most of the entrees were priced between $45-69!  This was the same as going to Spago.  Food: several good appetizer options at decent value.  Salads were pricey but huge.  I had lamb chops which was cooked as requested and portions was large, but it was $50+.  Another had the steak, which was $69.    The food is all acceptable but also not memorable.  The space was so loud however, almost hurt my ears.  If we were in a larger group at a bigger table, no way we can hear each other.    Decent place if you`re staying at the Bellagio and on an expense account.  But not worth seeking out to experience.<20<5<2019<6<40<48

His sister and I split the Italian Beef Beer Bread with a side of pesto salad and a side of green salad.  The waitress was nice enough to let us split and choose our own sides.  I asked for no cheese, but I think they forgot because there was cheese in it.  My partner got the turkey club.  Overall, the food was really good, except for the cheese.  I got the peach ale.  It`s got a peach flavor to it.  I think it was a nice dinner to end the day with.

We look around and just about everyone at other tables looked pissed and we`re looking for their server. At one point a table behind us asked for their manager and was complaining.  I will say the food is actually good which sucks since this is also a cool, neat place to hang out downtown before games or To grab a drink.  The spinach artichoke dip, wings and chicken Cesar salad were really good. Our server was running around all over the place and no where to be found half the time.

We had been looking for a larger sized area rug for our living room and didn`t want to spend a small fortune on it due to having 2 mall kiddos and 2 large dogs.   To be honest, I wasn`t expecting much based on other reviews, but was pleasantly surprised with our experience.  We were immediately greeted when we walked in the door by a friendly young lady who asked what brought us in to direct us to the right location. We were introduced to Kristen, who then asked some further questions about what we were looking for to guide us even better in our search. We were handed a bag of clips to mark the rugs we were interested in and then left to ourselves to look around, with occasional check ins to make sure we were fine and to see if there was anything else we needed.   After narrowing our search the rugs we selected were pulled off their hanger and brought to a wooden floor and laid out for viewing, I really like that they had different colored floor samples in that area so you could put one close to what you have at home near it to get a good idea of what it will really look like.   At this point we were pretty quick to make our decision and were offered the option of a rolled or folded rug, which I appreciated b/c the folded options allowed it to fit better in the car! The rug was brought to the front and we continued to walk around considering it was our first time in the store.   When it came time to check out the process was easy and upon seeing there was a line more people were called in to expedite wait times. There are signs everywhere talking about their 7 day return policy and it seems like if you get it home and don`t like it you have that amount of time to return, this will not be an issue for us as we are in love with our new rug!   We are already planning a trip back for more rugs to update the look of the house without having to break the bank!<20<8<2016<20<47<46

So, going to Boney Fingers was largely motivated by deep shame, a boundless well of self-consciousness and agonizing envy. I was staying at the the Hyatt in the meticulously ornate Arcade and must have passed by BF a half dozen times. Hands in pockets,  I know that my subconscious demons did not allow my eyes to fall upon the facade of BF.   After a very challenging early morning in immigration court my body required a breakfast that was created for those who are intimately aware of their flaws.   At 9:30 in the morning on the most unforgiving of days--Monday, the Arcade, lit by grey winter sky`s through its glass ceiling,  was dotted with a half dozen men who had either been working through the night or woke from a short and savage sleep, before dawn, to put on work boots still warm from yesterday`s abuse.   What I understand know is that a breakfast that is honest, muscular and made by men who understand the pangs of daily humiliations is all a man needs to raise his ten obese fingers to the sky and say '"I too have a place in this world!'""<19<11<2019<15<31<16

A couple of tips for this place, PLEASE READ:  1.) It can be a little hard to find. If you are not familiar with downtown Las Vegas and Fremont Street leave plenty of time to get there and find it. Thankfully I am always early for everything so we had some time to get lost.  2.) Make sure to READ everything on their website. I keep reading how people state there is a '"hidden fee'" of $100.... it isn`t hidden, it`s on the website and you should bring cash (which also is on the website). This is the officiant fee for his (or her)services.  3.) Tip your officiant and the photographer. That $100 fee to the officiant is NOT a tip, that is his payment for services rendered. The other fee you pay is to the chapel for space. Think about it, if you had an actual big wedding that is how it is done as well. You rent the space, you hire others to cater, DJ, etc...  4.) Photos are chosen by the photographer, you get 5 with your package. If you want more, you purchase more... same as any other photographer. They don`t allow cell phones so you can`t take photos during, although they did have the option if you pay a small fee they will let you have your phone  5.) HAVE FUN! This is not your serious type of place. Whether you get the quicky ceremony, the Elvis ceremony (which is what we did!) or the tiny Elvis (come on people they have tiny Elvis, it`s fun!) I saw some reviews that stated how disappointed they were.... this is not the place for your dream wedding, it`s a place to have fun and enjoy."<17<11<2019<11<57<53

I was too quick to eat the shrimp spring rolls and didn`t even get to take a picture. The hot and sour soup is really sour and spicy, which is definitely how I like my hot and sour soup. The soup had a variety of ingredients, just enough tofu, bamboo shoots, and ear mushrooms (my favorite). The honey walnut shrimp is very well seasoned, not too sweet, very juicy and crispy. The Hong Kong crispy noodle was not part of the lunch menu but is very largely portioned. I am definitely looking forward to try more items on the menu and they open so early... 10am. The service as well this early is amazing, they were very friendly and always checked in on us. The owner and chef, John was nice to come out and introduce himself.

I was not overly in love with menu options or the photos on yelp but I went in with an open mind and hoped for the best. The chips, salsa, and guacamole appetizer was large and in-charge. I could tell that everything was made in-house simply by the taste. The Chimayo pork taco plate is what I settled on and there was some serious flavor layering going on here. All of the ingredients in each thing I consumed were quality and done very well. The only complaint I have is that there is relatively no spice to the food which I think would help to bring out even more nuances. The interior is convivial and service is fantastic.

One of my friends sees Dr. Banister in the same office also so I thought it would be great. I called the front office to make a new patient appointment. They asked which insurance I had. When I told them Medica with United Health Care they said they do not accept it. I called my insurance company who assured me Dr. McDonald was in-network. I called again and they were adamant that it had to be titled only UHC to be accepted. They wouldn`t take the Insurance ID or anything to confirm. My insurance company called them directly and was then told they had the right to refuse new patients (instead of admitting mistake).

Even after I spoke with my driver on the phone going over the order, the hash browns came completely undone (ordered extra crispy), `sandwich I am` was nothing but soyrizo!!  That`s right, the rest of the sandwich was not there!!  The hot chocolate was small instead of large, and I got another cold lump of potatoes (?) that I didn`t order, came packed with the grill cheese sand.  The thing is, I`ve ordered this same breakfast twice before and there were no problems anywhere near this.  This ain`t right man, this ain`t right.'"      for the record the last time i ordered `sandwhich i am` subbed with soyrizo the driver told me that the cook said they '"ran out of soyrizo'".  given the context of everything i have experienced, i simply find that hard to believe anymore.             EDIT:  I am a little too slow to post this but i just realized now that i never followed up, and that aint right!  the good folks at snooze more than made up for the mistake.  they comped me a free one, and got the order perfect.  it was delicious!  i asked them about the possibility of running out of soyrizo, and evidently, it CAN happen because they get their stock in every day.  given that this is one of the few places you can get a vegan breakfast ... aaaand ... yes, it is possible to run out of soyrizo!"<25<8<2016<21<42<23

Prior to his appointment, I talked to Dr. Sara privately to let her know that he has medical anxiety.  While I don`t think PPFD brands themselves towards comfort dentistry, they went above and beyond to make my husband.

There was only one person in line ahead of me.  You provide an ID, register (have an email address ready to input), wait to be called to take the test.  Twenty questions.  An employee takes your picture with a tablet prior to taking the test.  If you study using their guides online it should be easy enough.  If you need complete silence you may have issues.   While taking the test you are standing at a tablet trying to concentrate and once in a while the employees call out data across the room as part of their routine,  and an intercom system calls people to a window.   At the end of the test the tablet calculates the results and informs you the percentage you got correct and whether or not you pass.  Need 70% or better.  You tell the employee monitoring the test whether or not you passed.  I did, so they then direct you to a table to get a number to wait to be called to a teller.  I sat for about a minute and was then called to a teller.  You pay (I used credit card) and they hand you your health card with your picture on it!  They remind you it is good for three years, congratulate you and you`re done!  I would say it took about 20-30 minutes from start to finish to get my card.

My daughter had the souffle that they blow up at the table full of banana pudding with vanilla ice cream on the side and my son had an orange dessert that was modeled into the shape of an orange with its very own handmade sugar leaf on the top. If anyone knows desert it`s a kid and my kids had a fantastic time. The restaurant is very small but there was a line to get in so you know the deserts are on point.

I had told him that I wanted either my wife or I to be home when the work was being performed, to make sure that things went well. I was less than ten minutes away when he called. By the time I arrived, he and several vehicles and several men were WELL UNDERWAY already!

I found The Scotch egg to be very interesting, but in a good way. The service is always top notch! This place is also great for picking up food to go. I tend to get the Shepherds pie to go. It is still piping hot by the time I get home, so no need to throw it in the oven. If you are in Vegas and are in the mood for some excellent authentic Irish food, well this is the place to be!<17<8<2019<16<21<9

The uber-tender chunks of tentacle coated with toasted spicy bread crumbs with mole was instant joy.    My exuberance continued as the meal went on!  '"Bikini'" made for an elegant pressed grilled cheese sandwich with sobrasada (raw cured sausage) and Mahon cheese, which was crispy and enchanting.  '"Molleja'" could be the atypical taco of the year featuring lamb sweetbreads, anticucho sauce and shiso leaf as the tortilla as truly a one bite wonder.  The smoky presentation of the '"Montadito'" could  not be ignored and neither could the taste of smoked salmon bruschetta with truffled cream cheese and honey.  Tweezers as utensils were actually kind of fun and came in quite handy like when grilling the beef game strong '"Mishima Wagyu Entrana'" tableside on ishiyaki stone.   It was also perfect for the '"Maine Lobster Salpicon'"; a fantastic cold dish with luscious pieces of lobster.  The mix of pickled onions and leche de tigre (rawr) with every bite of shellfish meat was awesome.      Formerly of Bazaar Meat, it`s not difficult to see Jose Andres` influence on Chef Liendo`s new restaurant and it should pay off in spades.  They`ll get my money, that is for sure."<1<10<2018<15<29<59

He is now 1 and again took him there and I kid you not their exact words without any examination '"everyone is coming in with croup, he has croup'" my husband and I asked to run tests and they told us no.

When I arrived, the place was packed, but I was easily able to pick up my order.  I bought my take out back to my office and imagined that I`d be opening it up delectable chicken hot off the split. Rather, the chicken was cold and extremely dry. For the price and in comparison to other restaurants, it was extremely over priced and did not live up to it`s expectation.  Based on this experience, I probably will stick with the local sharawma joint rather than try another dish here.<6<12<2019<21<51<34

Everything went smoothly and professionally. Unfortunately, the care was wrecked. I need to purchase a new car (quickly!) and when I called BMW Northlake, Yuri was unavailable. I spoke with another associate (cant remember his name) and he has not followed up. He involved a finance person named Hunter. I have been waiting sine last Wednesday ( a week) to receive an answer to my question. I called him last Friday to remind him that I need this info. Again, I have heard nothing.

He wanted decaf and it was made via French press. Wow!! The lady served it in the picture of the French Press making the $4.99 for coffee a little more palatable. The prices I feel are a little steep but I guess it`s worth it. Who am I to know the art of the Crepe? The preparation, overhead, paying their employees etc. At least we are supporting a small business.  Also, the young ladies are so nice. Who can beat that!!

My Physical Therapist, Colleen Smith, is fantastic. She was not only patient as she worked to understand my injury, she was flexible and continued to listen to me as it improved over time. Watching her in action it is clear she is hard working, dedicated, and genuinely cares about everyone who enters the clinic.   The techs are also focused and attentive. The front desk is professional and welcoming. The facility is clean and well maintained.

The layout of the restaurant was excellent with crabs and lobsters in fish tanks; like Red lobster on steroids!   If you`re from America, they only take Canadian debit/credit/cash or American Dollar, heads up!  We were brought or shall I say they dragged a grey bucket to our table with a 6lb king crab to get our approval and we chose three different styles of flavors. Then, they brought plate by plate our meals and it was sooooo much food for two. The style is family sharing like most authentic Asian restaurants!   My husband and I did well, actually he did well I just assisted! This is a must eat restaurant! The veggies they bring are just fillers though, I love veggies but they were flavorless! So they remained on the plate while the star of the show was defeated!  What I loved was there were plenty of waiters to help at all time, they went from table to table to check on you. But, we had one whi looked as if he was a manager and he was awesome. He gave amazing tips on what to order and we were satisfied on our choices. He wore a blue shirt instead of a black shirt, so I`m figuring he was management!<7<12<2019<16<29<26

We were so lucky to find that Dr. Prettyman accepted our insurance and was accepting new patients.   My 8 year old daughter needed braces as a result of an impacted front tooth. Her first experience with any dentistry was traumatic since her front tooth became impacted as a result of a fall at 2 years old. He was so clear and professional and really helped us to understand the process and what to expect. The entire staff is so welcoming and assuring. Every tech that assisted in her monthly adjustments were so kind and friendly. They truly take a gentle approach in treating young children.   My daughters teeth are now simply perfect! As a bonus to Dr. Prettyman`s knowledge in his field, he is one of the most down to earth, genuine professionals I have ever worked with in the healthcare field. His compassion is so refreshing. The moment you meet with him you just know it`s not about the money. The field is lucky to have him. It is safe to say that my daughter just loves him and is no longer scared to go to the dentist.

I went with a friend who bought TWO new iPhones and paid full price for both plus screen protectors and when I suggested that for an entire purchase (almost $2000 worth) the store could offer a gift such as the pop socket ($12), the manager (a Marcus Welty) not only treated us as THIRD class citizens (whatever that may mean) but gave me the worst attitude and said, '"We don`t give products for free here and if you don`t like it, you can take your business elsewhere'".  I`m a Sales Rep for a very large company and do you know how much stuff I give away  for free to make sure my customers are happy, feel appreciated and COME BACK???  Well, I got into my BMW, and will most definitely take my $150K yearly income '"business'" back to AT&T. Thank you very much '"Marcus'"!

I had a reservation for 3 at 6 on a Sunday. When we arrived, the front desk was unorganized and did not have knowledge of the reservation. They seat us, only 2 tables are seated. A waiter says he will be with us in a minute, and goes and helps his seated table. 3 other tables are seated while we look over the menu. The waiter begins taking drink orders for the other tables, by know we have been seated for 10 mins, and we don`t even have water. The original waiter comes back by and says another waiter will be helping us, and he will be with us in a min. The only other waiter proceeds to immediately go take the order of an 8 top as they are being seated. We waited close to 20 mins before asking for a manager. The manager comes out, and is obviously upset, not at the staff, but us for interrupting whatever non managing he was doing in the back.  I can`t comment on the food, let alone the water, as no service was provided to even allow us to order.  TL;DR - Don`t waste your time or gas going to this place.<23<4<2012<3<27<3

For a single mom doing her best under not the best environment in the world, for that, i commend her.

Best Western Lawnfield Hotel hit a home run when they decided to to listen to patrons and open a fine dining restaurant and bar.  I finally had a chance to check it out.  We first walked into the bar area, it is is very trendy and sleek, and the bar is opaque with cool blue light shining through it!  Very cool!  Although our reservations were in the dining room, I was very impressed by the bar area, I will have to check that out at another time!  We were promptly and politely greeted and shown to our table.  The atmosphere in the dining room is very elegant with a hint of nostalgia floating in the air.  Our waiter was more than polite, and he greeted us within a timely fashion and took our drink orders.  The menu has a dining room selection, along with '"Pub Fare'", which you can order off of also even in the dining room.  I started off with the crab cakes appetizer which was great!!  My dinner was the Salmon dish, and I have to say, the Salmon was FRESH!!!  Cooked perfectly, with no heavy Salmon smell I have had in the past.  It was nestled in a best of perfectly cooked wild rice and spinach.  It was great!  My fiance had a bone in chicken of some sort, which I tried, and it was cooked perfectly as well, but still had an unbelievable moistness.  We both had dessert, I had the cheesecake, and she had the bread pudding.  Both of us were thoroughly impressed with everything and we definitely have found a new regular place for us in Mentor.

Almost every major company will at least give you store credit or let you do an exchange.  This '"new'" policy of theirs stinks!  They lost a customer over a $14.99 throw pillow!"<26<5<2019<21<13<33

As I`ve said many times, my dad lives for the latest and greatest in fine dining and this time he picked Chelsea`s Kitchen.  CHELSEA`S KITCHEN  Chelsea`s Kitchen is owned by parent company LGO Hospitality.  The name '"La Grande Orange'" (LGO) was inspired by the creators looking through historical books on Southern California.  A pictorial review of the vast citrus groves that provide the United States with much of it`s fruit were always part of California. Inspired by that piece of Americana, they pay reverence to those good times, positive vibes, and winning spirit.  LGO Hospitality includes, The Misfit, LGO Grocery & Pizzeria, Chelsea`s Kitchen, LGO Café, The Luggage Room, Ingo`s Tasty Food, Ingo`s Tasty Diner, LGO Bake Shop, Grateful Spoon Gelato, and Buck & Rider.  THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE  My dad and I were seated at a lovely table on the patio.   My only complaint about the patio is the amount of leaves that fall into the food and drinks, but hey, that`s not really a problem, is it?  We ordered some drinks. I tried the Diego Rivera, which was Frida Kahlo Blanco Tequila, Grapefruit juice, and fresh Thyme. Nom Nom Super Yummy!  I had the paella and my dad had the daily catch.   OMG my paella was YUMMY and HUGE! My meal included an extremely generous portion of seafood and fresh sausages.  The staff has been WELL selected, which speaks to the professionalism of the management.  The staff was not OVERLY friendly, which I appreciated, and they had their timing down; always around when we needed something, yet not hovering either.  CONCLUSION  I had an incredible meal and pleasant stay at Chelsea`s Kitchen.  I will definitely be back!  5/5 RECOMMEND  OF NOTE  *Parking is a bit hectic. We used the Valet.  *For more information: chelseaskitchenaz.com"<3<4<2018<20<36<19

Chanpen Thai Cuisine packs all of the delicious Thai flavors you are dreaming of into their meals with a little kick. Don`t worry though, if you can`t handle spicy foods, you are in luck. Chanpen allows you to choose the level of heat in your dish from 0-5, and with that option, anyone can enjoy a meal at any level of heat they choose!   They say that some of the most wonderful gifts come in small packages and Chanpen is truly an unexpected and wonderful gift! Be prepared to squeeze yourself into a tiny parking lot off of Broadway Road, and into an even tinier restaurant at that. The accommodations may be minuscule, but trust me when I say that the flavors are huge!!! It may seem small and unassuming, but it will surely please your tastebuds as well as your pocket.  The curry is one of my favorites dishes to have here. I`ve tried the yellow and the green curry, and both were phenomenal. Packed with so much flavor and goodness too! You can try some for yourself for a great price, since their lunch specials allow you to enjoy a flavorful dish of curry, rice, won tons, and spring roll for about $8! Most recently, I tried the Thai Toast and chicken satay with peanut sauce and I was very happy I did. The mango sticky rice was great too, except it had waaaaay too much sauce for my liking; the next time I`ll just request a light drizzle ahead of time. The complimentary green tea ice cream was the cherry on top of my most recent visit to Chanpen - so good!   Thank you Chanpen for always delivering delicious, quality, flavorful food! I am a big fan!<8<11<2018<4<58<2

This is not a luxury hotel, it`s more like a typical Marriott . This may sound harsh,  but I rarely write reviews and usually don`t complain , but just felt this was needed .  This is my second year attempting to spend my Anniversary at this property. Last year my wife and I  came for the first time and stayed at the canyon suites . We were very specific that we wanted a golf course /city view room . I order champagne and strawberries to be delivered on arrival. On arrival we had no champagne  and a view of a rock , the exact opposite of what we were promised . We were eventually given the correct room after complaining and champagne was delivered the following day when we were gone ??We then went to spa which was marginal at best - we were assured the inexperienced therapist were new and would be replaced .   This year our son is attending ASU and parents weekend fell on our anniversary and we thought we would give it one more try . Same plans , champagne and a view room , but this time we thought we would stay at the regular Phoenician hotel and booked a '" view suite'" . We were again assured we would have a view over the pool and city . Again no champagne and our view is of a giant air conditioning unit and roof top . This time nothing can be done and we are stuck paying $900 for a shitty room and not the room we were promised  . Just returned from spa again same crappy therapists. Just a '"sorry you are disappointed and would you like charge the $400 treatment to your room'". Don`t get me wrong it`s a nice facility , but staff with very poor and inexperienced therapists.   So needless to say this is my last stay !! And this is the way they treat their bonvoy platinum members!!   Beware!"<8<11<2019<19<52<30

We stopped in here while in town for a conference and were pretty disappointed all around. We ordered a few appetizers including the Meatballs which were  great - so I thought we were in for a nice meal. However the Calamari was just OK, the bruschetta had too much mint, and they never refilled our bread basket once.   About 30 minutes after our appetizers we still had not received food. When our salads/soups finally arrived one of my coworkers remarked '"I forgot we even ordered these'" because it had been so long. Mind you, the restaurant was not even half full. The drinks were also incredibly slow.   After we finished the salads I had to get up to take a phone call and came back 15 minutes later and there was still no food. At this point our entire group was frustrated so we asked them to just box all our food up without eating it so we could get out of there. When I got back to my hotel room the seafood pasta I had ordered was not very good at all and certainly not spicy.   If you`re looking for a meal in the Westgate I would stay clear of here. The Sportsbook and Japanese restaurant are both better options."<7<11<2019<23<43<53

I`ve been here on weekdays and on a Sunday...they were pretty busy no matter what day.   There are other things that are different between the original location and this one: - this location takes credit/ debit cards - much bigger and has big tables especially important if you`re with a group  I`ve tried several types of dim sum from their carts: cha siu bao, siu mai, noodles, Chinese broccoli, Dan tat (egg tarts), red bean sesame balls, tofufa, etc. My friends tried the ribs, and chicken feet which I don`t eat. And of course, I had to get their crispy pork (from the regular menu). They also have duck but by the time I figured I wanted duck, I was already too full and you can only get a whole one. The next time I come back, I`ll be sure to get the duck.  Their dim sum is pretty good and freshly made. They have quite a variety of the steamed kind but they don`t have fried dim sum like fried shrimp wontons, shrimp ball, crab ball, and that fried deliciousness. That`s the only thing I wish they had.  And just like all dim sum places, you won`t really have a clear idea as to how much each item costs but there is a pricing tier unbeknownst to diners and cart pushers just know which pricing tier box to stamp. If you`re observant enough, you`ll figure it out.<14<3<2019<0<11<44

It`s lightly sweetened with a great flavor. Added boba and melon balls to it and I could drink two of them back to back, so good.  We have had the honeydew smoothies with boba as well, it wasn`t sweet, which I enjoyed. Very delicious.  There`s only a couple of tables and chairs, not really a place to hand out but to order and leave.

That is until Rob showed up,  He did an awesome job, was incredibly knowledgeable and went above and beyond the average commercial cleaners that I have used in the past.  He quoted me a very fair price before he started cleaning (about half of what his competitors would have charged) and that was the same price I paid when he was done.  My carpets looked almost new and definitely better than when I moved in.

Husband and I were so eager to try this place out after reading such great reviews. Love the ambiance and hip feel to this place. Unfortunately there was nothing about the food that left us wanting to come back for more. Our waiter made our experience slightly awkward because not once did he shine a smile to us. He meant serious business from the get go.   Jalapeño poppers. I must warn you, it`s spicy as hell! Comes in a set of 6 with each popper pre-dunked in a cheese ranch sauce. I was expecting a crunchy outer shell with a soft and warm center with the cheese oozing out. No. Nothing close to it. The poppers already pre-dipped in individual sauces is a bad idea, Gordon. The sauce made them soggy and uneasy to eat. Would be much better if the sauce was on the side.   Beer batter onion rings. Nothing amazing about it. Tastes like onion rings I eat at the state fair. Meh.   Farm burger & American burger. Unfortunately both burgers are the upsets of our dining experience. I couldn`t even tell you how the burger tastes because the salt was so, SO overpowering at first bite. I even informed our waiter of our burgers being way to salty and there was nothing that could be done other than a careless '"Oh really?'" response. My husband and I both took one bite of the burger and left. (refer to my photo) No replacements was even offered to us.   All in all, this was by far the worse burger and meal I`ve had. Definitely will not be dining here again or at any other GR restaurants. What a disappointment."<30<9<2016<21<50<31

The cold brew was also listed with three different prices, so I thought they had pitchers, but they actually only have two sizes (I think it`s 8 and 16 oz... not positive).   To eat, I had the chicken fried chicken which was very small and mostly consisted of fat, which made it very hard to chew. The flavor on the fried outside was delicious, and I`m sure if the meat had been more tender, it would`ve been delicious.   All in all, probably wouldn`t go back.

She started with the colour of my skin, asking which country I was from and could not let go the argument. An argument that what I replied, is correct or not, then she had problems with my body, that it was different, she has not massaged anyone like my body, and that she is an RMT therapist, so she should not be doing massage to me... I did not get this point either, as I was getting an RMT massage. After 35 mins of torture I still asked her if she will go the massage or not, she brought a wet towel and started beating it on my back, so harshly that all my back hurt for 2 days and was all red.

I chose the chicken caprese sandwich, which came with your choice of salad or chips (Caesar salad for me). The bread with the sandwich was superb. The outer crispy crust contrasted well with the moist, soft texture of the bread. The chicken was tender and flavorful, and the basil/mozzarella combination was excellent. The salad was crisp and refreshing. It was quite a lot of food for $5!  Service was good despite the large number of patrons. Drinks were refilled as needed and the owner and staff were very friendly.  I believe the lunch special runs on the first Tuesday of the month. I`ll definitely be back to try more of their dishes on other days though!<7<5<2015<21<19<57

I contacted several local companies but Nick and Liberty Inspections stood out to me with the several interactions we had.   He explained in detail what he would do for me and how he would get me through the process.  I decided to use Liberty Inspections and never regretted it once through the entire process  They all took the time, even when there were time constraints,  to really teach me what is really needed to be a good inspector.  I took each day as a learning experience and at the end of each day I always walked away learning something new.   I also got to see first hand how Nick and his team go the extra mile with their Buyers and Agents (Buyers / Sellers), showing that they were more than just a transaction.  This entire experience has given me a good foundation  to be a good inspector, but this also gave me first hand experience on how to do business the right way to setup for long term success.  Thank you again Nick and everyone at Liberty Inspections.<18<11<2019<18<47<27

The 1st time the service was incredibly slow and the food was mediocre. It was when it first opened so I thought I would give it another try. My friends were in from out of town and wanted to try it. The service was even worse the second time. We waited forever to be seated and then waited at least 15 minutes before the waitress showed up. I was told that if you are not a man (who would tip well) don`t bother going to Whiskey Row. The waitresses are extremely rude and impersonal and the food is not worth what you pay for it. It`s too bad, I love Dierks Bentley`s music and he is so generous and fun loving, his restaurant needs to reflect him! I`m sure he would be very disappointed in the Gilbert location.<14<10<2019<2<3<7

I was a bit hesitant after reading some of the mixed reviews but decided to give the place a try.   Our server was very slow and not all with it but that didn`t stop us.  We just immediately went to the salad bar after getting a table and helped ourselves to our first clean plate when we were ready for meat.  The buffet had some nice options (I agree with some of the comments about it needing to be freshened up).  The meats came out frequently and they were friendly and later asked if there was anything in particular we wanted (which they brought out).  Most of the meats were very good.  I didn`t care for a couple of them including the leg of lamb (too rare and the garlic beef).  The filet, flank, bacon wrapped chicken, and picanha were very good.   I was too full to try the beef ribs.  Dinner buffet was ~$50.<24<11<2019<1<34<1

After visiting Austin and trying the Snooze there a group of friends and I decided to try this one in Houston.  We were very disappointed.  The wait was unnecessarily long.  We literally saw a few tables open for up to 10 minutes without anyone being seated.  When I asked management about why the tables were open he said that people are given 7-10 minutes to claim their tables.  The drinks were weak and the food didn`t taste as good.  Won`t be back unless they bring trainers in from Austin to shape up the place.<13<10<2018<15<2<39

NK-MWUFt4sh_F_ciIJytaA<6qn0XmomgH5Vh0xe8OCFVg<utIA0LyQmwP-9DRyxUe6qQ<4<7<1<3<Great new breakfast spot in Montrose! I`ve come here twice now and I would definitely recommend it for breakfast/brunch. Came here opening weekend and the line was out the door. At 12pm on a Sunday we were told it would be a 1.5-2 hour wait and we waited an hour and 40 minutes before we were seated. Luckily they take down your cell phone number and text you when your table is available so feel free to walk around, grab a drink at their bar, or play one of their outdoor games while you`re waiting. The only reason I agreed to wait that long (I HATE waiting) is because I live in the neighborhood so I went home to wait and just sped over there once they texted me- otherwise, I don`t think this place is worth a 2 hour wait. The other time I came here was on a weekday at 11am and I only waited 20 minutes for a table.  They have a small private parking lot but if that`s full, there is plenty of street parking in the surrounding neighborhood. The restaurant is filled with plenty of booths, which is great for groups, plus they have outdoor seating and a counter/bar area with stools you can snag a seat to eat at without a reservation.   Once seated, service was quick and attentive and the wait staff is very friendly and great with recommendations and questions about the menu.   The first time I went I ordered Havana Daydreaming which is pork, ham, and gruyere cheese on an open faced bun topped with a sunny side up egg- YUM!! It was delicious!! And the second time I ordered the BEAT sandwich- bacon, egg, arugula, and tomato topped with avocado. The BEAT sandwich was ok, I wouldn`t get it again- the bacon was too overcooked in my opinion and thin. The real winning dishes of this place is the Sweet Utopia section of their menu. I am not a fan of sweets but luckily the people I came with were and so was I able to sample the sweet potato pancakes, OMG french toast, and the drunk`n monkey french toast and they were all aaahhmazzing!!! I looooved the OMG french toast.   Also, they have a quirky selection of hot sauce so if you`re a fan of spicy food definitely try out the Yellowbird serrano sauce- it has an awesome kick to it!! I recommend putting this on the hash browns.  I definitely will be back to sample the rest of their menu but I`m going to wait until the hype dies down or come early on a weekday.<30<7<2016<17<17<54

And parking is extremely challenging. Got a seat at bar and bartender was very attentive. Mimosa was pretty watered down. Upside down pineapple pancake was great.  A single was enough to share. Avocado toast was ok. Bread was not awesome. Will likely go back to sample more pancakes. Other entrees being passed looked appealing too.<15<7<2018<17<47<24

So not trying to throw my friend over the bus, I say that I can see people inside with tennis shoes on. He shrugs and says he`s not letting me in.

Yes, one should:) Lab testing places always have a filled waiting room, it`s unavoidable from our end.  Have that id available, along with your insurance card and lab work.   This does help the process go a bit more seem less. I schedule my lab appointments online and about a week in advance.  That alone can ease the sitting around and long wait.  Now, my rating system for this location should be as follows: Not one star for the two front staff females the morning of my well in advance scheduled appointment.  This is not my first go around with having my blood drawn.  Heed my warning when I inform said two females that I have the worst veins for one to locate for the draw.  Even the most novice of lab workers cannot find one.  Not to mention if one must fast.  I need to lay down, I bring a small cooler bag of juice and cookies for afterwards.  They smirked at one another.  Such professionalism from those two `lovely females`.   Hopefully they change their dispositions sooner than later.  If not, those two belong in a back office.  I`m called in, by LuLu. She is a ray of sunshine!   We discuss the previous mentioned and she immediately responds to my warnings with not one issue and takes her time.

Her husband is lovely, but is more of a personal assistant for her than anything else. Trying to get her on the phone is impossible. Her e-mails are less than professional. She refused to take a look at our walk-thru we handed in & after numerous conversations about the master bathtub not getting hot water with Mark, she flipped out on my ex husband and I. She even had the audacity to tell us, '"THIS ISNT A NEW HOME. IT`S NOT GOING TO BE PERFECT.'" Uh, wow. I`m not expecting our place to be '"perfect'", but I expect to be able to take a bath or bathe my kids in the tub. Guess I`m wrong for that? The first 24 hours in the house and our kitchen sink flooded our kitchen. They were great & had someone out the next day, but once you`ve been renting for them for more than 90 days, service turns to crap.  Also, Kristin was trying to take the credit for us choosing the place, but it was OUR realtor that showed us the house & set the appointment for us to do the application & sign the lease. A month later our realtor STILL wasn`t given her commission because Kristin was still trying to take the credit for it. Our realtor had to come back to us and have us sign papers stating that she was in fact the one who showed us the property so she could get paid. Save your money. Save your time. Don`t do business with them."<13<4<2019<3<27<35

As others have said, they are selling mass produced corsets from Pakistan (Cosh international, you can find them on Alibaba) while claiming they are individually crafted and made in Canada.   2. The corsets are way too expensive for the quality that you get. You will still probably get some results if it`s used properly, but you can get the same for much much less. However, they would like to make you think theirs are the only corsets out there worth buying. Totally dishonest and unprofessional.   3. Their conduct towards customers is tardy and also unprofessional. They are known be be plain rude including but not limited to, insulting clients and blaming clients for the product faults.   4. They are using deceptive business practices with their Facebook group. The group is set up like a waist training help group for beginners. However, anything but pure praise of the brand is suppressed. No one is allowed to mention any other brands (even in impartially in passing or to ask for advice). If they find out that you are even part of any other corset groups (or criticise/mention other brands) you will be blocked from the group.   5. Returns are notoriously difficult.   As I said, you will probably get results. But paying a premium to be manipulated and insulted. No thanks!<9<12<2019<10<58<22

of_v57kRVOn9wZ435fGdBg<Kpi6PaJIVnK7EJvbAx8GGw<GrJ74hxJsXXwcqS7zcfFhw<2<2<0<0<I`ve dined at Ruth`s Chris 100`s of times over the years & this particular location has really disappointed the last few visits. During my previous visit, they inadvertently threw away my steak when boxing the leftovers & we waited 20 minutes for them to make a new medium-rare petite filet. I asked for nothing, since mistakes happen & thought that I would at least receive another steak for the inconvenience. When I arrived at home, I noticed they just cut off a small piece of another steak, which was smaller than what they tossed. I brushed it off & my husband & I came back for our anniversary. The waiter asked if we were there for a special occasion (which was indicated when booking) & then wished us a Happy Anniversary. We generally notice that there is no consistency when it comes to special occasions here. Sometimes, you receive a complimentary dessert of your choice, other times they prepare a complimentary dessert of their choice, or you receive nothing. My husband had shrimp & it was quite good, I had my usual petite filet medium-rare, which came out as medium & covered in excessive amounts of pepper. I used my mashed potatoes to help cancel the excessive pepper. When we received our bill, we noticed the dessert was not listed, so we figured it was complimentary & we were using our OpenTable MasterCard credit & this time, had gift cards as well. We paid & when the manager returned, he placed the check holder down, indicated we had a balance & took off. I knew this was not right, since the gift cards & $10 MasterCard credit covered the total along with additional funds towards the tip. When I opened the check holder for the 2nd time, the manager actually added the dessert onto the check & didn`t use the OpenTable credit, rather he selected a $10 comp for Birthday/Anniversary for the dessert & kept the OpenTable MasterCard credit. Considering we were there for our Anniversary we were insulted. When a waiter drops a check, no additional items should be added. Had he come back & said, I`m sorry, I forgot to add something to the bill, then we would have understood & addressed the issue. I firmly believe that had we paid completely by credit card, they would not have added our anniversary dessert onto the check. We waited 10 minutes & the server never returned to our table. To Management, if you don`t appreciate OpenTable or gift cards, don`t participate in the programs. We won`t be back.<25<10<2018<12<40<58
lhKwObtMTtbcnFDnakwWDQ<nJJUpmsXy6YyAHu32XurDw<EEIz44ewHhOKmfTloAK13g<4<1<0<0<True to it`s reputation, the service at Alo was impeccable. I had never been served to the standard that Alo did, even at other fine dining restaurants. From the start, the waiter introduces herself and addresses you by name as she leads you to the dining room which is a nice personal touch. There was not one, but three separate servers who attended us and came by within the first 30 seconds to introduce themselves, pour water and offer napkins (served on a tray no less!) I was dining with someone who works in the food industry and had many questions about the menu and how the food was prepared. The server was able to answer most of his questions without a beat and was very knowledgeable. That is the mark of a truly well-trained staff.   As to the food itself, it was unique. I could tell each course was designed with considerable thought. The chef found ways to combine certain flavors and ingredients which I wouldn`t have thought would go together. For example, the foie gras ice cream! This altogether left me anticipating what the next dish would be because each bite was a surprise. While most of the dishes were unique, there were still a few dishes which were good, but not especially memorable.   OVERALL: 4/5 stars because while the service was great and the food was unique, I can`t say I would ever crave or dream about any of their dishes. It`s wonderful for a one-time experience to try out different combinations of flavors, but it`s not a place I would want to come back to again and again. So for that reason, I cannot give this place a full five star rating.<23<6<2019<22<35<19

There are a couple of reasons why I have rated them a 3/5 stars. First, the indoor area is not adequate in size to the amount of traffic they bring in. Because of this there is ALWAYS a wait. Second, they took away the ability to check in on yelp so that we could show up shortly before the time of our check in. When I questioned the hostess about that, she was extremely snarky. She said that is wasn`t fair to the people who were waiting at the restaurant. I am not sure how that is not fair considering the fact that ANYONE could use the feature. This is the second time I have had to walk away from this restaurant and head across the parking lot to there competitors. (Who remember my name, my kids, and my order.) Final<29<7<2019<17<38<49

Since the new ownership, it`s not the same anymore. The food used to be really good and the workers were really accommodating and friendly. The food now is okay, but it`s not the same how I originally remember it to be. One waitress will keep insisting to order more items. It gets irritating because it`s only my boyfriend and I. We usually order two dishes, which fills us up and is more than enough for us. But she`ll insist to order drinks, appetizers, or add another dish. She even said '"I don`t think this is enough food for you both, you need to order more.'" I thought she was just messing around but she was serious.

My partner and I ordered kibbie nayyeh (lamb tartare), jibneh, a fish entree, and dawali (stuffed grape leaves) before ending with bassma for dessert. Everything was bursting with flavor and came out promptly after we ordered it.  The experience was soured, however, by our server. First, we decided to eat inside while the rest of the patrons were dining outside. The waiter seemed to be the only person serving so my partner and I (both having been in the service industry for a substantial amount of time) gave him leeway for taking 20+ minutes to finally take our dinner order after serving us bread and drinks. Throughout the course of the visit, he was abrupt (taking the menu out of my hands while I was still in the middle of ordering) and unfriendly (not once acknowledging any '"thank you`s'" my partner and I gave and walking away immediately after completing a serving task). We also had to order dessert from another employee since he failed to check on us once after he brought out our dinner.  Despite all of this, I still left him slightly over 20% as a tip and this is when I became mostly insulted. The bill was $58.76, I left $80.76, and asked for $10 back leaving a $12 tip. At this point, the waiter asked me how much the high octane gas was that I put in my Mustang. I informed him I did not drive a Mustang to which he looked outside and said that he confused me for someone else who was in the parking lot and proceeded to ask about what kind of car I drive. After I told him, he informed me that I left him a $12 tip and that would give him a quarter tank of gas. Never before have I ever had a server comment on the size of my tip or infer that it wasn`t enough. I found the interpersonal experience highly unprofessional and insulting. Having a competent front of the house matters and--in this case--not having one soured anything great that came from the back."<24<6<2019<21<15<47

The map of the salon drops you off at a Thai happy massage place that also does nails, don`t go there it`s the wrong spot!   The exterior of the salon is super cute and they did an amazing job with the interior as well. Getting my nails done is an escape for me and the interior salon and the overall style and experience is extremely important to me, they killed it with this. They also have a wide variety of gel and dip colors options which is important to me because I`m extremely picky!   So far I`ve seen Felicia and Steven and they were both extremely friendly, professional and paid close attention to detail. One of the technicians was doing her toes at the chair/her space (who I also originally had an appointment with but she passed me off to Felicia). This isn`t on the salon as it`s not their fault but it was just tacky on her part I think if girls want to do their nails between clients they should do it in the back. Especially when you were supposed to have them as a tech and they said they couldn`t take you.   I look forward to telling my girl friends about NAB and Felicia because we`ve been searching for an awesome salon. It`s worth the marked up prices in comparison to the other salons due to the quality of their customer service, the friendliness of the techs and the shop itself.    I<14<6<2019<2<16<10

He then went on to lecture my boyfriend and I how they are an anti-straw facility and we have to ask for straws since they don`t hand them out (I literally asked for a straw and wasn`t expecting him to give me one without asking). He was trying to tell us to ask for a straw while ordering our drinks because '"the waiters do a lot of back and forth...'". Well gee I`m sorry you had to go back and grab a straw, big deal. If having to go back and grabbing straws is such a big deal then how about you ASK when taking drink orders??  Either way, I`m not here to listen to you lecture me about how you guys run back and forth or how you`ve asked the manager to switch to paper straws. Half the tables in here have drinks with straws, you think their waiter lectured them on straws?? Probably not. Rude."<2<6<2019<18<47<42

Mattresses like you`d find on a rollaway bed. Paper thin walls and NO ELEVATOR.  That means dragging luggage upstairs to get to your room. I`ve stayed in several other casinos associated with this brand and always been exceptionally happy.  This was downright scary and yucky and never again.<23<7<2015<21<55<33

Our experience upon arrival at the hotel was far from being pleasant. We were assigned a room in the courtyard building. The room was small, smelled of musk and infested with smoke. The floor was dirty, the bathroom was filthy and the bedding was not fully made. Only a fitted sheet and flat sheet was on the beds. The beds were hard like cardboard and loud anytime you moved. There were also dead roaches in the room when we opened the curtains to look out a filthy window. The food in the restaurants was decent and decently priced however the service was extremely slow. I would not recommend this hotel or ever stay here again.<16<2<2016<17<15<56

Located near Downtown Phoenix, this centrally located gem has been a Phoenix staple for years, so I`m told! The best part, their happy hour goes until 7p! Yes, please!

For HH food, the potions are big and can definitely be a meal! They offer meatballs, calamari, Caesar salad with blackened chicken, Caprese salad, a combo plate, and more for $5-$8! Pretty much everything is $5 except for the combo (shrimp scampi, calamari, tortellini) is $8. Such a steal!   I`ll definitely be back for happy hour before doing something fun downtown!

First of all, location - it`s easy to find and conveniently next to Square One but there`s no free parking around unless you`re willing to walk like 10 minutes. It`s okay if you have someone with you and can drop them off to quickly buy & go, but if you`re alone it`s a pain. Plaza is pretty new so everything is clean and spacious and modern.  The actual poutine, I found good but not mind-blowingly fantastic enough to deserve the $15 price tag. We ordered the normal poutine; I like keeping it OG at first try. The best thing was the texture - the fries and cheese curds are super chewy. Portion size (we upsized) is solid, definitely enough for 2 people, but there isn`t enough gravy and near the end of the poutine experience we ran out of cheese. The gravy was good; subtle and richer in flavour instead of the super artificial type gravy I`ve had elsewhere. All in all, it`s a solid poutine; good cheese, good fries, and okay gravy. The flavours go together well, but since it`s nothing insanely good or new, in my opinion, it`s not really worth the high price."<3<10<2018<5<15<29

I`m still new to writing reviews so that`s why I haven`t written about this place yet but my family has actually been going to this restaurant for over 10 years and counting. I was in elementary school when I first tried this place (before they remodeled and opened it up bigger), and now I`m in college. Crazy right? The service is also so good here and the servers are the sweetest. I remember coming here on a holiday once a few years ago and they gave us t-shirts! Now to the food. I don`t need a menu to order. Hands down no name and turning japanese will ALWAYS be on the table. Superman is great if I`m feeling cream cheese. As for the appetizers, spicy seafood salad is THE BEST. Most sushi places don`t serve this at lunch but Yama does. You really do get the best bang for your buck and it`s pretty cheap compared to other places. Agedashi tofu, soft shell crab, baked and fried mussels, and hamachi kama never fail to make it to our order. I didn`t even like tofu for the longest time but I would always eat the agedashi tofu. I really recommend trying the tempura UDON!! I have udon at every ayce place I can and no place beats Yama. The broth is so savory and the flavor is crazy I could eat their udon all day. I haven`t found any ayce place that beats Yama and I`m sure you won`t be disappointed if you try it out!<4<8<2019<21<54<41

I used to stay at the Rio all the time about 10+ years ago. I gotta say, the rooms are still exactly the same. A little old, but spacious as every room here is a suite. The view from our room was nothing much. Just another part of the hotel and buildings. It was really only a place to crash, so it was fine. The beds were comfy and we had a fridge to store our leftovers.  A decent hotel, but definitely in need of an update. Especially with all the nicer hotels on the strip now.

Throw that ball down a shiny lane and hit the pins at the end of a big mechanical machine that re-racks them! Is that all bowling is! Of course not!!  The game of bowling is more than just fun it takes genuine talent and energy to figure out how to line up that huge circular ball to knock all those pins down in two tries! That sounds like a lot of work! Depends on the individual! Bowling is calming and a tactile high of you play properly.   Bowling at South Point is just a place where you can come and sharpen those basic skills to maybe get on a league or just know that deep down it will be a strike almost every time that colorful ball comes into contact with those shiny pins. I played three games with Daniel this time around and while he beat me the first game, games two and three were winner take all.   The atmosphere of the bowling area is very comfortable and welcoming. I felt nothing but fun and glee while we were throwing huge round and colorful balls down that slippery lane. The chairs swing back and forth if you need to sit. The whole time we were playing there was no need for a chair. Bowling can release endorphins that push you to win, win, we will take nothing else! There was no need for sitting while we were playing. The excitement was all around us as we wore those stylish bowling loafers and sent our bowls down the alley.   The staff was super friendly when we went to pay for the bowling. You pay before you play which is customary. No free lunches! The shoe rental is reasonable at $3.75 a pair, in so many many sizes. Although the style of the shoe is all the same. The wonderful staff of South Point provided a coupon book for me when I signed up for the players card. There was a coupon in the book that provides three free games when you buy three. The cashier took the coupon and was extremely polite and professional all the way! The staff of the bar and snack shop were pleasant too! The employees here are always ready to assist a guest no matter what it seems!  Now to the food, bowling believe it or not works up an appetite. After the first game I was wandering around and you know it discovered the snack bar. At the time the smell of pizza was emanating from behind the counter. The prices are extremely reasonable so I went all in Vegas style and ordered a large Pepperoni Pizza. The price with a large drink was $17.00 for the pizza and drink. One cannot beat that. There are no refills on the drinks though, so I was glad that I ordered the large. Pepsi is there drink of choice, sorry Coke fans.   When I brought the large pizza to the table I got only raves from Daniel on how much I bought. He approved of the large pizza. Oh that`s right, gents are content if there not make them a sandwich. Opening that pizza box filled my olfactory senses immediately. The wave of freshness was immense. I picked up the first slice and all that cheese j just oozed over the side of the slice, but still stayed on the pizza. That bite of the pizza was even better. The Pepperoni was amazing and just the right amount. The cheese was extra and made for a delicious balance of cheese to Pepperoni. The sauce was just perfect. Usually after you finish a slice the crust for me gets tossed, not this time. The crust was the best part of the pizza here. Just think about this: the pizza was from a snack bar. This was some of the best snack bar pizza I`ve ever had! Highly recommended to try the pizza here, even if you do not Bowl.  Whether you come here to bowl or eat pizza now you know what`s the 411 at South Point. It is very family friendly and for all sorts of age groups. To be honest there are more 65 plus seniors that bowl here than us young individuals. Bowling is great exercise too! Come and try bowling for yourself with that special someone, solo, or with some twins you will not regret any of it! Try the pizza from the snack bar or you will regret this. Their is a bar just in case you need liquid courage! Now go and have fun while working out at the same time. Yeah!<3<10<2018<16<57<28

There were just a few guests when we arrived just before 3 pm. Decor is colorful, even cheery with its Day of the Dead theme, dark wood furniture and hand painted murals.   Our server was Cade, and while he was upbeat and easy to talk to, over the hour he dropped the ball on several key things. If I ask for water, bring it. If I have to ask again ten minutes later, don`t go check another table first. Your salsa is devil fire Satan hot. Ow.   We tried several street tacos, each under $4 and served on corn tortillas. All were nicely dressed and fresh. My cod was the winner, with cabbage and pico and creamy sauce. We each had the carne asada which we requested rare, but came out super well done and chopped. Meh. And hubby did not love the chorizo potato version. It smelled lovely to me.   For entrees, he chose the elote, a grilled ear of corn rolled in spices, mayo and butter. Not a thrill.  I ordered the corn salad with grilled shrimp, mild. Those shrimp were sexy and smoky, crisp and chewy and worthy of designer greens. Instead, the lettuce was chopped iceberg, pale and wimpy and white under its sprinkling of black beans, corn and lime vinaigrette.   Yes, it was tasty, but when Cade checked in we suggested darker greens to bring it up to Revolu`s colorful look.   Beverage wise, I can happily endorse the watermelon Aguas frescas as something lightly sweet and smooth. Call it liquid watermelon with the perfect texture. Yum.   Dessert was not an option, given our need for naps, but I`m eager to try the churros ice cream sandwich with cajeta. There`s more, but why settle?  The husband was underwhelmed, but with judicious ordering I`d try again with a margarita loving girlfriend or two.<8<12<2017<3<32<16

I got a last minute appointment for an hour long massage. The massage was supposed to start at 4, but check in was a disaster. The girl working the desk was totally overwhelmed. I got into the room about 4:10 promised (and paid for) a 50 minute massage. The therapist asked if there were any areas I wanted her to focus on. I explained my leg problem and she acted like she understood. Then I got the standard spa massage with no attention paid to my leg other than the token work. When she said we were done, I looked at the clock. She`d stiffed me a whole 10 minutes, so I ended up with a 40 minute massage for $150.  I`m sure there are infinitely better massages on the strip where the therapists actually listen to your concerns. I wouldn`t recommend this place to anyone who wanted anything more than a '"spa experience'" on vacation."<12<4<2014<2<2<14

I went there Saturday hoping to go to the dead squirrel museum, and as the parking lot was empty except for two cars, I thought I was safe.  I didn`t want to go if there was a funeral going on (obviously).  So I went in, and the guy came out and asked if he could help me.  I said that I was there to see the museum.  He replied '"NO, NO'" in the most nasty way.  He then continued in the same nasty way, '"You can`t go to the museum on weekends, and you have to CALL first'"  I apologized, and said I didn`t know that.  He said '"this is a funeral home FIRST'" as he herded me out the door.  I felt like I was about 4 years old being yelled at by some old man next door for cutting across the lawn or something.  Now, I totally get it.  I get it that it`s a funeral home first.  BUT, first of all, it`s just bad for public relations to be so nasty to someone.  There was obviously a polite way to handle that situation.  I wasn`t rude to him.  Rather than hissing NO at me, he COULD have apologized and said that the museum wasn`t open at that time and said a time to come back.  I would have totally understood that.  Second, fuck you old man!  What do you expect having a dead animal museum in the basement?  There is absolutely nothing posted anywhere stating the hours or availability of the museum.  As that was not Sam Sanfilipo himself, I wouldn`t mind telling him to eat shit.    I am a customer too, and I have every intention of telling everyone I know (especially anyone in need of funeral services) about what a prick the old man at the Cress Funeral home was."<15<12<2008<16<25<2

However, most Shawarma places I go to end up being around the same price.   My son and I love this place. We don`t come as often as I`d like but it is because of the higher prices .  That being said, we love the food and the service. My son spoke of how much he loved dolmas and the waiter ended up giving him a free dolma. We ended up buying a 1/2 dozen before we left. They were delicious and juicy.  Leg even let my kiddo try the rice, which he went with because he loved that also.   The beef shawarma was great. There was a bit of grease at the bottom of our platter but it was moist and I can get over that. The salads are always great. I love the dressing. I love the pickled veggies they give with the plate also. Their tzatziki sauce was yummy. At first I was disappointed because there was only a small hole filled in the plate but then the waiter surprised us by bringing on extras. Much better! I love my shawarma with that refreshing, clean flavor of yogurt and cucumber.   We ordered fries because we remembered them to be pretty darn good. They aren`t homemade or anything but it is a good price for the amount of fries and they do come out nice and hot. We enjoyed them.   The hummus on our plate is so great. I love it. I think it`s one of the best. My obsession their rose water tea Yep! I`m infatuated with the tea. My husband is persian so I`m aware I could just go buy rose water and make my own tea but I save this as a treat when I come to eat here.   There is nothing fancy about this place.

They also forgot four pieces of nigiri. I told them about it and they got it to us very fast. Ended up leaving them behind due to the looks of it.

The menu is very unique at first, the combinations seem overwhelming but after eating my meal I will seriously try anything on the menu. My buddy and I both got the Sampler Entree and split a queso fundido.   The queso fundido is delicious but the tortillas that come with it are the stars of the dish. To quote my buddy '"you could put anything inside those tortillas and they`d be delicious.'"  The sampler is out of control. Seriously. It`s one of the best dishes I`ve ever had. The skirt steak is delicious, super flavorful and I usually don`t eat my steak medium-rare/medium but I`d eat this anyway that they prepared it here. The pork enchilada is crazy good and the chicken enchilada is crazy good, so is the cheese filled chile relleno.

I have been going here for years and there is just something about their drinks that I love. I have tried probably every single boba place in Southern Nevada and this is still the best one!  They use fresh fruits and you can see them cut it up when they blend it in front of you! You can see the drinks being made when you order and the boba is fresh out of the oven. Every time I get boba, the tapioca is always chewy and warm... makes the perfect combination with the cold smoothie!  This store also has an dried fruit and seafood snacks. They sell by weight so you can order as little or as much as you want and can even mix different assortments of fruits and candies. They also have dried cuttle fish and dried squid you can order to eat as a snack with your delicious and fresh drink!  As for me, I always order the same thing. I have probably tried all the flavors and the best one that I like is the coconut slushie with lychee jelly and NO boba. It is so refreshing to me and I crave it every summer especially with this hot Vegas heat!  Give it a try and let me know what you think!<3<6<2014<6<4<9

If i didn`t have a home I`d probably opt to sleep under any given bridge under an expressway. Upon check in our first room had a lamp that didn`t work, which in an already poorly lit room made it difficult to see more than 2 feet in front of you, which would have resulted in my makeup coming out like a five year old`s art project. We were quickly and seamlessly moved, which is where the customer service ended. When we moved rooms we were delighted to find all the lights worked now allowing a whopping 5 feet of visibility. From there, the experience was downhill. The room smelled. It wasn`t vacuumed. The walls were as this as I aspire to be. Which resulted in us being woken up to the screaming and blaring music of the neighbors every morning. It wasn`t all bad though because the noise forced us to get up and take in an unparalleled view of the cracked roof and what I suspect to be a maid`s cart who threw it along with herself off the roof when she could no longer take the filth of the hotel. The room offered no amenities like most Vegas hotels do. No robes, slippers, shower caps, body wash or the like. The shower had drill holes in the walls. The room did offer a stocked fridge that left no room for anything guests may need to place in there such as medicine. One of the members in my group had diabetes, so we called and asked for a fridge for her insulin. We were told we could absolutely had one for a measly $35/night. When told we could provide proof of the medical condition we were still told it would be $35 a night. When asked if we could remove the items from the fridge in the room we were told we could and would be charged for all fhe items. We were additionally instructed it wasn`t a temperature controlled fridge fit for storing medication. When we asked to speak to a manager about this we were told the manager '"was in bed sleeping.'" The blatant disregard for human life by the staff we interacted with was more disgusting than the hotel itself. The room service prices will cost you the same as attending one of the 5 star restaurants in Vegas and will be served in plastic containers and a brown bag as the hotel no longer brings anything in on plates or a table, which makes me feel better that in addition to the disregard for human life they equally disregard the waste of plastic and effects on the environment and ocean. In sum I probably wouldn`t even be so inhumane to recommend this hotel to an ex or an enemy."<5<9<2019<2<1<10

This time I got to actually visit the brewery&what a cool hang out spot it is. Our friends brought their dog who was able to sit INSIDE with her, not just limited to the patio area(brownie points)!!! I did a flight and tried the Cotton Blonde which was nice, a watermelon beer which was refreshing, but I will say that my VCB has competition. The shandy is SOOOOO good, a great all summer drink. The stout is a for sure show stopper as well, very smooth. Bravo This place is a MUST when visiting, and of course taking beer back to NY!!<23<7<2019<14<29<46

Just happened to pick this place on Google.   I am used to walking into a self-serve laundry place and having someone without a personality sit behind the counter and do nothing.  This place, however, is completely different. The two gentlemen there were absolutely phenomenal. From the moment I walked in and was greeted through their advice on which machine to use and offer of assistance, I was completely shocked at how well I was being treated here. The treatment I received made me feel like I was in a 5-start hotel or high end retailer.  Stop by here for great service.<7<2<2015<22<29<54

Mind you it`s not that busy right now, I asked for a soda once our food came out I told the server that helped in the beginning and then the server that brought us our food and still haven`t got my soda. Then my wings were cold and hard like they have been sitting around for a while. Didn`t even finish them because of how cold they were. There`s a lot of people waiting for tables to get cleaned and they haven`t been cleaned I don`t know if they are short staff or what but tonight was really bad service in general. Only reason I`m giving them a 2 star is because the beer was cold. Probably will be my last time coming to this location.<25<5<2019<4<44<33

Ended up going on yelp and found this Vietnamese place close by so we decided to give it a try.  Food came out fast and place was clean. Service was nice and polite as well. It`s a little cozy restaurant if you`re in stouffville and don`t want to mission to markham or Scarborough for pho. I ordered chicken noodle soup which is supposed to be pho ga (shredded chicken with noodles) but I got grilled chicken instead with my noodles. My friend got the house special pho and he said it was alright. We got the shrimp fresh rolls and the deep fried shrimp rolls which was really good. My Vietnamese iced coffee was too bitter tho because I don`t think there was enough condensed milk.   I think I`ll come back if I`m in the area and need my pho fix but there`s better viet spots out there for sure. The menu is definitely more westernized and not as traditional as other restaurants as it doesn`t have some dishes like bun bo hue, bun rieu, or banh cuon.<31<3<2019<21<26<58

This place has got to be one of the absolute WORST food experiences I have had. I ordered a steak quesadilla and a steak burrito. Although the food tasted fine, they`re service is why i will NEVER go back. 1st they didn`t ask what I wanted on my quesadilla just made it then told me they couldn`t add anything, then took 5 minutes to comprehend that I wanted 2 orange juices and a gatorade. cost $31. We ate there then when I asked for a to go box they told me I wasn`t allowed to have one even though i spent $31 on food there. I also had to wait for them to stop just conversating with another spanish woman who didn`t buy anything just so that they could ring me up. They were irritated just by the presence of customers and just don`t give a shit about anything but gossipping to themselves in spanish while customers wait to order.<13<10<2016<19<8<11

And I must say, it did not seem like it was Katie`s first night. She has a radiant beauty that stands tall and has a grand stage presence. Her smile, her focus and of course her long never ending legs makes me pretty sure she was a former Jubilee girl. One thing is for sure, she fits. Keeping up with the others during their routines was not a problem at all for her and she even brought some of her own personal flair to mix. I don`t know her show business dreams, but I can easily see her being a Crazy Girl for a very long time. Oh, and she loves to bake. Lol just kidding.<1<10<2018<7<6<51

They used to be friendly with great food and reasonable prices. The quality, and service have been slipping for the past few years and the prices climbed a bit. We could forgive that for a while but this past weekend, we went in after an obviously busy early dinner session. All but 5 tables were open. It took them 10 minutes to seat us and then another 10 to get menus, a request for water was met with a snide '"we`re to busy you`ll have to wait'". One server was '"busy'" bussing tables, like taking 1 bowl and plate at a time. The owner whom we`ve known for years was rude when we asked if we could order '"I told you we are busy but I`ll take your order but it won`t make your food come faster'". Really?  There are 3 servers literally mozying between tables to clean them (at one point the male server made 9 trips to the table next to us to clear it off-it takes that many trips when all you take at 1 time is a pair of chopsticks). We got our food after an hour and it was cold-all of it. We managed to eat about 1/2 before we had to leave. We mentioned the cold food to the server (who did nothing about it) and then again to the owner when we went to pay the bill. Her response was '"oh sorry too bad you came when we`re busy'". When I paid the bill (nothing comped for the terrible service or food) she yelled out '"what no tip?'"  After that, we made it clear how disappointed we were that this would be our last time at Lemongrass-just as loudly as she had yelled about the tip. In a city where Vietnamese joints are a dime a dozen, it`ll be easy to find one that matches up to the Lemongrass West of old--do yourselves a favour and seek those other ones out."<20<9<2018<19<25<47

No one was trying to rush me off or make me feel like I they are way to busy for my questions (Even though they were busy!)   My son had the pleasure of being able to go to meet Dr.Rez and staff and they were nothing short of amazing. They treated my baby with so much love and kindness and made him comfortable. He is a 4 year old who went to the dentist for the first time ever but he behaved so well and the staff made him feel so loved.   2nd time I came in with my two crazy daughters. They were NOT as behaved as my son but they still made them feel completely safe and loved.   I discovered all my kids have tongue tie & lip ties and I was so scared that the dentist would want to knocked them out and sedate them, but I was assured, he is not going to be doing that if it is not necessary. I really loved how safe I felt about leaving my children in there care for the procedure.   This place is amazing.  I HIGHLY recommend that anyone with small children come here. There is so much comfort and my babies where treated so well.   I have a normally skiddish 3 year old girl who is actually very skeptical about strangers handling her but she loved it, she had a great time, and they have TV`s on the ceiling for them.

I like all of the locations, but I`ve been to this one most often.  I am not from Phoenix, but I travel there often for work.  Being a long time Yelper, I am always looking for a new restaurant to try and experience.  However, I put all that aside when it comes to Postino.  I MUST make a point of going there whenever I`m in town.  Let`s talk bruschetta for a second.  Has anyone tried one they didn`t like?  And the fact that you can pick and vary your flavors is a major bonus.  My faves are the burrata/bacon/arugula/tomato and the brie/apple/fig.   However, I love them all.  When I`m feeling not so carby, I`ll get either get the cheese board or butcher`s block.  Both fantastic and filling!  I haven`t even mentioned the wine yet.  I am not a wine expert by any means, so I generally will ask for recommendations.  The staff is SPOT ON each time.   Everytime my wine has been so perfectly paired with what I`m eating, all the flavors are enhanced.  The prices are very affordable for what you are getting.  Plus, they have that bruschetta & wine special on Tues & Wed which is so cheap, my company is overly pleased when I turn in my expense report.    I can`t forget to give props to the staff.  Everyone is perfectly helpful without being overbearing and I always see happy faces and teamwork whenever I`m there.   That`s a sign of good management and a very well run place.  Kudo`s to everyone at all the Postino locations!  You really know how to make a girl happy!<9<1<2014<15<12<37

The minute they sat me in the chair for a pedicure there was another tech doing my manicure.  They said they had the matching gel color and the color of my hands was completely different than my hands. They cut my cuticles so much that I had cut marks. My toe nails were not trimmed they didn`t even ask if I wanted them trimmed. On top of that paid $53 and that was a basic mani/pedi.<17<8<2019<22<38<10

This was my sixth store trying on wedding dresses and I was thinking I would need to take the risk and order a dress online in order to find one within my budget. Instead, I found a dress that I absolutely love here! Brilliant Bridal (both the Phoenix and the Mesa locations) were hands down my favorite of the six stores I visited.

eec1G5IQYUqUN6fYhUHN8Q<ZXSNzKI638WQ3x5iKgM-ug<U5Ow3ffmrG4MmTZLK6jd-g<5<2<0<0<My new favorite! My goal is to try EVERYTHING on their menu because so far, every soup, bun, salad, sandwich, and entree that we`ve tried has been fantastic. Such rich flavors with actual spices and unique seasonings; not just salt. I`ve had 3 of their soups and all of them were delicious. My favorite is the green borscht. So light yet satisfying. What a tasty, smooth flavor. If there`s a heaven, I`ll bet they eat this green borscht soup up there. Speaking of heaven, CABBAGE ROLLS. Holy Moly! This dish is delicious perfection from top to bottom. Love the sweet tomato sauce that tops it. The rolls themselves have a flavorful rice and pork mixture inside. Hearty portion, too. The ultimate comfort food. Come to think of it, the entire menu here is comfort food- Eastern European style.  Also, the man at the counter is very helpful, friendly and easygoing. Every single time. Good prices, too. I hope anyone who isn`t afraid to venture outside the common American menu & try something new will give this place a chance. Your taste buds will thank you.<28<2<2019<15<48<6

You`re given salsa and chips when you first arrive and the salsa is very very tasty! Our waitress seemed a little overwhelmed and didn`t speak much, almost like she was annoyed we were there although the place was not crowded at all.  I ordered a chicken enchilada with green sauce, this came with rice and beans which lacked any actual taste but the enchilada definitely made up for this!

You never know what you will get and you realize essentially they have no liability for your property. You just have to trust they will take care of you.  Everyone I worked with there was great, sales, dispatch and crew. I can`t say enough good about the crew assigned to our move. I had cello`ed and bubble wrapped most of our items but they in many cases added more. Extra cello, tape and blankets. The guys were neat, polite and professional. I don`t name names in reviews let`s just say N, A & J were the guys. Oh yeah, the truck was clean and organized with a pile of blankets about four feet high. They had this neat little protector they put on the door jamb to protect it and the items going through.  We found NO damage at either house or to any of our items they moved. This was up and down stairs, twisting hallways and through doorways. They were fair with the billing and I feel their service was a good value. Thumbs up guys for a great move.<16<12<2016<5<10<32

0abzaZs_NwmDGDbbbU2Gdg<3fF0_WKBp30qkhRS84kzJA<YF4QJ_j-PM7cMZja6K1MwQ<1<7<1<2<UPDATE ON THE BELOW: I reached out to the company, based on the comment the company left below. They informed me that the negotiation down to a $2,000 minimum for my table made up for the $500 we spent on tickets, which was not the deal. We were at all times told that this would be separate. This is pretty pathetic service that I would not expect to receive from any Wynn hotel, particularly the Encore. I am in shock at the lies being told to us and the hoops they are making my friends and me jump through to get out hard earned money back. I don`t think I can return to an establishment that scams its customers like this again. See full story below   This place scammed my friends and me. They offered us a table for $2,000, and when we asked if they would credit our ticket purchases of $500 (four at $125), we were told that the money would be refunded to us instead of a creditif we called the club after with the receipt information on hand. When we called, they told us they didn`t do that, and were unwilling to refund us the money.   This is not the level of service I`ve come to expect from Wynn resorts, and the Encore resort in particular. This was very crooked behavior on behalf of the club, and just downright low because we ended up spending well over $2K at the table.<2<6<2018<5<38<12

I`ve been planning my 30th birthday trip from last year and booked this hotel due to my M Life rewards and credit card for points. I stayed at the Delano from December 11-13, and at first I was excited to stay here with the reviews, but it was not quite the excitement I got.     Upon check-in, I had given the front desk my credit card, which they had on file, but she said the card kept getting denied, which was odd, because I had no charges on it. So I gave her another credit card, while I would call the first credit card to find out what was happening. As I got to my suite, and called my credit card company to find out the problem, I got a ring at my door, which I opened and housekeeping came in to ask if they could check the room. (This was quite odd, as my room was supposedly ready for check-in, but it must not because a total of 3 housekeepers kept ringing the doorbell to check the room).     I finally got through to my credit card company and they mentioned that my card was not going through because the hotel had already charged my credit card at 7am that morning, which also had the holding charge. So I called the manager at the front desk asking why I was being charged twice, to two different credit cards. She said she was unclear to why the front desk agent had done so, which had already pissed me off due to having 3 housekeepers come in and out of my room as I`m trying to get settled.     As I left my room to get some dinner, when I returned in noticed that my toiletries had been moved from the right side of the sink counter to the left side, which a towel was placed underneath. I thought this was odd, and thought this was probably housekeeping coming into my room while I was away. But what I noticed is that they had taken my personal washcloth from the shower. This just set me off, as I had only been at the hotel for about 3 hours and had the worse experience ever, and to ruin my birthday week.   I was compensated $50 food credit which I used on my second day at the hotel and ordered room service. BUT the chicken panini I ordered was the worst I`ve ever had. There was no taste, the chicken was bland and I thought this was supposed to be good as it came from their restaurant, but I thought wrong. Upon checkout on the 13th, I had called the front desk manager and she was able to compensate me the early and late checkout fee, which was nice, but again this was the worst experience I`ve ever had with any hotel throughout my life. I will definitely not be recommending this place to stay to anyone. I would recommend the W hotel (Whenever/Wherever) as they had much better quality of service and just felt more accommodating to their guest than this one.   Pros- -Compensated Early/Late Checkout -$50 food credit  Cons- -Poor customer service from front desk agent, charging me two times on different cards  -Room Service food bland -Housekeepers knocking on door repeatively -Housekeeper taking personal wash cloth and not able to provide new one<3<1<2017<20<51<49

I wished that I had went to Olive Garden instead. We had the very popular spaghetti and meatballs and our pasta was still raw it wasn`t cooked thoroughly and still hard and the sauce didn`t really have an flavor. The bread they give you is really good however the spaghetti wasn`t a hit for me. It`s pretty pricey as well but if your coming with a big family the price and portions work out well. Our waiter was very quick to attend to our needs. Also me and my bf are pretty tall and have long legs and they tried to put us at a small table and when I requested a bigger one they said we couldn`t because there was other reservations with bigger parties. That`s really stupid because I made a reservation for a reason and you would think they would be willing to accommodate better.<17<8<2019<19<28<42

They pulled up tiles, took pictures, and told me honestly what needed to be done. The other companies guessed at what might be the problem.

I came here with my buddy Dion to grab a coffee and hangout for a couple hours.   It was our first time coming in today. Upon entering you are immediately immersed in a beautifully designed interior with plenty of tables and chairs to enjoy a drink or food of your choice. Music is playing and the barista immediately greets us. I do not remember what her name is, but she was helpful as we told her it was our first time in and she gladly have us some helpful suggestions.    We both chose to get the Green Me Up which was essentially a matcha latte. We modified our orders just a tad by asking to add a shot of espresso in them  definitely a drink worth trying    Only reason I give this place 4 stars is because of their weak wifi signal. For some weak wifi signal may not be a big deal, but for those of us who plan to study from their computers or other tasks involving internet, it`s not a great place for that.<8<8<2018<21<22<42

By that point I was already annoyed with the back and forth confusion. I asked the employee how I can obtain a refund for the refused voucher, he said he wasn`t sure and to contact yelp.

I stopped by after a day of shopping at the premium outlet mall to grab some takeout.  I tried the pizza and the baked ziti.  I just ordered the small cheese pizza or the mini and it was pretty good.  The baked ziti was just ok, as I`ve had much better.  The baked dishes come with a salad and it was good.  The staff was very nice and chatted a bit while my order was being made.  I would probably  return for pizza and maybe try something else on the menu like the garlic knots as I watched them being made while I waited for my pizza.  This is a great location near the outlets and very spacious with lots of tables and I believe there was patio seating as well and a few TV`s for watching games, etc.<19<9<2019<10<0<41

Food is really five star, the only reason I knock off a star is that the decor is drab and not really a very inviting space.  That said the chicken soup with Mazza ball is home made and delicious.  I had 1/2 corn beef sandwich and the size was more like a full sandwich.  The corn beef was hot and reminded of the best I have had in my youth in Brooklyn.

Since it is our first time, we asked the waitress what they would recommend which they indicated fried congee.  We ordered that, plus wasabi shrimp, hainanese chicken, curry beef with roti and fried glass noodles.  We thought this may have been too much for a group if 4 but it seems just about right as the portions run small.  When the food arrived, we were very surprised by the flavours and dishes.  There was no chicken flavour in the hainanese chicken, the curry sauce for curry beef was just spicy with little flavour and taste, the wasabi shrimp was good and with large shrimps, and the fried glass noodles were fried vermicelli which was unexpected.  The flavours were overall ok but we had expected it would be made more traditionally and more flavourful.  The best items which we enjoyed immensely were the fried congee, roti (that came with the curry beef) and the shrimps.  Overall, would recommend this restaurant but perhaps, for myself, I would choose a different selection of dishes Overall - 4/5 Price - 3/5 - dishes runs from $12 to $19 but value and size not comparable Food - 4/5 Ambiance - 4/5 Service - 3/5<7<10<2019<19<57<50

I called junkman to help me in my time of need and they came through with swift efficiency! I needed my garage and backyard cleared out except for the extra paint and flooring for the new buyer of the house I`m selling. I called from out of state, they got over there same day, looked around and gave me a quote, charged me, and got the work done, AND sent me pictures of all the areas, BEAUTIFUL! I had peace of mind knowing the things I asked to be left, were left in the garage and they showed me in the pictures. Sergio called me to double-check and get clarification on what was to be removed and what I felt could stay. I feel like the weight of all that junk is lifted off my shoulders! they made the process so painless and easy. AWESOME JOB you guys. Also, the estimated quote I was given when I first called was spot on. The man asked me '"About how many pick-up truck beds'" the stuff would take up, and that allowed him to estimate the load size.

cJdvuXJXH6pH4nMYbJ8VOQ<_mV6xoQmMCVcM-_K0Pe8Rg<RCdWzJI0acxponN70QDRcw<1<2<0<0<My wife and I booked a room at the Delano for a weekend to celebrate her birthday.  On the Delano website, the suite we had picked, the Delano King Strip View Suite.  On the positive front, the folks at the front desk were very accommodating and put us in  higher floor for the view of the Strip.  However, things went downhill from there. We go to the room and found the bathtub was dirty, the side table near one end of the bed was stained and hadn`t been cleaned, there were hooks for bathrobes but no bathrobes and an open can of Pepsi in the mini-bar. The soap they give you is very small and frankly, not up to par with a supposedly high end hotel.  Very little amenities such as shampoos etc.. They have them but more on par with hotels where you don`t pay as much to stay in the room.    I had arranged for champagne and strawberries to be sent to the room upon or arrival. I called down for them to be delivered and after some minor confusion, the items were being sent up.  By this time, we decided to ask for another room as this one was so dirty.  A very nice representative at the desk moved us from the 18th floor to the 8th floor.  At the time we were leaving our room for the other room, the person bringing the champagne and strawberries showed up.  We told him we were moving and he said he would meet us at the new room.  We got to the new room and although we didn`t have much of a view,   the room was cleaner. We waited for a while for our items to show up and they never did. We actually beat the guy bringing the items to our room!!  We called down and they ended up sending someone else to deliver the items. We never did find out where the original guy went to.  We tried to open up the mini-bar, however, the mini-bar door wouldn`t open. We called down to the desk, again, and a nice man tried to remotely unlock the mini-bar.  After several tries, it opened.  However, it locked up again and we had to call down for what seemed like the thousandth time to get them to send up an engineer to open up the mini bar. As I am writing this, we are still waiting.  I have made arrangements to move to another hotel for tomorrow night.  The rooms are drab, have no personality, stark white with some browns in the cabinet area over the mini-bar. The bathroom/shower area is the best part of the room.  Anyway, we are willing to cut short our stay here and go to a hotel we know, on the Strip, has great rooms and customer service.    We had high hopes for the Delano but it has been a lousy experience.  There needs to be more quality control over the housekeeping and more attention to detail. The rooms need upgrades. For what we are paying for this room, we could`ve gotten a nicer room at the Venetian or any number of fine hotels on the Strip.<16<8<2019<23<0<3

Vanessa should have disclosed her lack of experience with ombré. I would have gladly found someone with experience.

ZYdKQ_bv-BYYYz0pV4F0qw<eR8fBtTjtFDuEwhxEYlEeg<nixvZ8h6u19eey6UDbXRwg<5<1<0<1<Bottom line - if you want a vet that is friendly, professional, and gives you options to best care for your pet within the constraints of your lifestyle, go here. They prioritize helping you give your pet the best life you can, without needlessly overcharging, upselling, or guilt tripping.  I first requested a quote through Yelp as I was considering switching vets for my 3 cats. My previous vet was good, but I felt constantly pushed into doing tests that weren`t strictly necessary for them (to the point of feeling guilt tripped). All 3 of my cats are strictly indoor only, so I knew certain tests and shots (while recommended if you want to be super cautious) were not necessary for them. I found the quote reasonable and decided to give them a try.  Dr. Nam was different from my previous vet - he understood where I was coming from and was honest in that those tests and shots were something we could do if we wanted to, but that the chances of needing them were slim. There was no guilt tripping to make me feel like a bad pet parent - what a change!   My 2 babies that needed their visit this year were thoroughly examined while still maintaining the respect of their boundaries (as anyone with cats should know, being patient and letting the cat take its time is of utmost importance). They were given their necessary vaccines (FVRCP and Rabies) both with 3 year amounts, which I don`t believe my other vet offered. They had fun playing on a beautiful cat tree that cat trees everywhere should envy!  One of my babies also has IBD, so we had a lengthy discussion about diet (she`s currently on a prescription diet). Dr. Nam was able to recommend several different ways of increasing our pets dietary health, each with varying levels of cost and effort that would have to be put in. It felt great to be given options that I could choose from depending on how much time and money I have, rather than just being pushed towards a pricey prescription diet.  Everyone at the facility was professional, friendly, and easy to talk to. I think I asked more questions than I ever have because I felt encouraged to ask questions, rather than silly for asking questions as I normally do. They are definitely our go-to vet from now on!<27<1<2018<16<30<28

6Bw43dv2_HPxyAuhqc9puA<LQdk6bJIcyBI6GbQE_ZpmA<Y1AyPfNDzNhEpUsfuYP_lA<1<0<0<0<Aight I used to love this place. We always ordered  here because my family is mad broke and we need  to eat. One day my mom says she only has 100 dollars in her room and so if we need to get pizza we need to get change so we`re like okay we`ll let the delivery dude know.   I put my order in online and specifically say bring change for a 100. They bring extra change and it seems all good. While the delivery dude was counting it outside though it seemed like he counted it wrong. So when I went in and counted the money I found that we were given less than what we needed back. We called back the store and the dude came back. He told me and my brother ( me being 14 and him being 12) that we miscounted it and that he was really good at math we couldn`t be wrong but he said if he has extra money at the end of his shift he would drop it off to us. I thought that was weird and told my mom who like a mom does freaked out that her money was basically stolen. Note we`re broke broke. So she calls corporate just in case I have no clue what she said to them. After that we got our money back and everything was fine and dandy just a simple screw up.   A few months after that In August (this all happened In June) I call to order. They tell me that we are banned from delivery because of something that wasn`t even our fault STILL NOTE my brother and I are minors. We shouldn`t be getting reprimanded for a mess up on the delivery persons end that he fixed!!   All in all this used to be my favorite pizza place and now I have to settle with dominoes.<16<10<2019<10<13<5

My kids especially love the assortment of scooters, bikes, play cars etc that are set up around a race track and a play area that has a play grocery store set up with shopping carts and a huge play kitchen area as well! There is also a toddler area that has mini versions of climbing structures, slides and developmental toys that are suited for those not quite ready to get in the big jumpy houses! My son loves all the slides and obstacle courses and the huge basketball court jump house! Staff is friendly and there are always birthday parties when we go and they do a great job Decorating in the party room!

We weren`t sure what to expect from a '"hotel restaurant'" but the entire experience was wonderful.  We sat outside and the patio was really lovely and relaxing.  We received great service from Mark and he offered many suggestions and consistently checked on us to make sure that we were enjoying our meals.  We started with the Pierogies and the deviled eggs, and both were excellent!  We then shared a Caesar salad and the red lentil soup.  The Caesar salad was far and away the best Caesar i`ve ever had (and i`ve had many), I can`t put my finger on it but the dressing, the croutons, everything was really great.  We shared the bolognese as our entree, and while this is not a traditional Italian bolognese it was very good and well flavored.  Overall we really enjoyed our experience and we will definitely return!"<24<6<2019<13<14<1

Do yourself a favor if you live in town and sell some plasma at least once a year to come enjoy refueling your body with the delicious spread of the Mansion.  Between the view, the bottomless mimosas, the pancake bar, the seafood spread, and the elegant setting you`re bound to have a fantastic Sunday.    All of the food we sampled (which if I`m being honest was enough to overflow the bed of an F150) was of high quality and very good.  The seafood was especially great.  They had crab legs, oysters, clams, mussels, and shrimp to add to the ocean of champagne in your stomach.    At $49/pp it`s on the high end of the brunch budget but it is worth it to treat yo self or impress some out of town visitors.  If it`s your first visit make sure to fill up your mimosa and stroll through the house after your meal.

Took my parents out for a celebratory brunch with my 3 brothers. We split the bill 4 ways to pay for ourselves and our parents. The next day, my card bounces getting gas because I didn`t have enough money in my bank account. I checked my transaction history and realized that they charged my card twice without my knowledge. Assuming they accidentally double-charged me, I call the restaurant to see what was going on. I was told that they would conduct an investigation (for real) and get back to me in 24 hours. They didn`t. I called on 5 separate days and was repeatedly told the same thing with no action. I can only assume that the server accidentally split the bill wrong and decided to lazily throw the rest of the bill onto my card at random rather than notifying us of the mistake. If I didn`t have bills to pay I wouldn`t have minded all that much, but the inconvenience it caused me, the lack of action on their part, and what little value they appear to have for their customers is what makes Toro the epitome of bad business. Don`t go here. There are plenty of restaurants that will provide you an exceptional dining experience and be honest wwith you; Toro is not one of them.<19<10<2019<14<45<12

It is a cute place, we sat in the main dinning area when you first enter. We got the meat Bao and Curry ramen. The Bao bread was really good and had interesting flavors. The ramen was a huge portion - we shared it. It was creamy, spicy and delicious. We also ordered sake and wine which were both tasty. The staff was friendly and kind, prices were pretty good.   It was a cozy place with low lights, nice for dates of groups. The high top seating along the window looked really cold. The music was good but had us laughing -- an interesting mix of 90s hip hop, a few other old school songs, and current music.  I took a star off for a few things that were not a huge deal but we would have wanted to go a little smoother. There were several tables open throughout the main dinning area and they sat us directly next to one couple and directly behind another. Our waiter was a bit slow when we wanted to order a glass of wine and again when we wanted our check even though it did not seem super busy.<24<1<2018<23<6<0

And I love asian desserts and love trying new things so I needed to see what this place was about. I came here with my best friend. It`s a decent sized place. The people who work there are really nice and helpful. I didn`t know what to get so the girl at the register helped me. I ended up getting the lychee crush. It was alright but I wasn`t super impressed and in love. Nothing wrong with them. I just had never had lychee before. My best friend got the strawberry horchata. His was pretty good so we actually traded. But I would really like to come back and try something new because this is my kind of stuff that I am into. It was just a weird flavor and fruit for me.

I returned to the store and after looking at it they said that the oil cap was missing. The oil got all over the engine and even after replacing the oil the oil cap and cleaning the engine my car smells like oil. They seemed as if they really weren`t bothered by their mistake and said that it happens sometimes. THey did send me home with a free box of TSP to use go try and clean my driveway I spent 2 mornings this week waiting for my car to be serviced and reserviced there is no TV, wifi, or even magazines to look at while you wait I certainly have better things to do with my time than spend it at Canadian tire and the afternoon trying unsuccessfully to remove the oil stains from the my driveway of my new home. I will never again go to this Canadian tire Not sure where they get their mechanics but IMO they are not qualified and experienced enough to be trusted. Well they screwed up again I had to take it back for the third time it seems they didn`t clean the engine properly and it still leaked oil all over my driveway once again ....fingers crossed that the third try is a charm. The location and the fact that you can walk in may seem convenient but do yourself a favour and simply walk away.

We were very well taken care of by the staff, from the hostess to our awesome and helpful server (as they have a rather large menu) to the manager who came out to check on us.   The ambiance was really nice and the patio was gorgeous!  We opted to dine inside as the only 3 high tops outside were in the direct sun.  This is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5-I wish there was more seating for happy hour.  The high tops weren`t the most comfortable things and it would be impossible to bring a group.

4jycDwCU08WChsWDtLVHew<2jKzO_01d12oiu-2bOYcYg<av_-ePHJwSSqMtTQbNoL7g<2<5<0<2<In a nutshell: customizable stir-fry, all you can fit in your bowl. Flavors depend on what you put in your stir fry. The contents of your bowl get cooked for you.   The concept of all you can fit in your bowl sounds great but it doesn`t end up being all that much. The bowls are not that big which makes it awkward to put in a lot of ingredients. Not that I`m asking for huge portions but for $14, I`m not sure if that`s worth it for a small bowl of stir fry. For $3 more, you can get unlimited bowls. In terms of flavor, it really just depends on what veggies and sauces you put on it so the potential of having a great stir fry is there. It`s just without knowing what the sauces taste like, it hard to pinpoint what you`ll like.   I should also note that all the ingredients sit out and there`s one buffet that stores raw chicken right next to noodles among other non-meat ingredients. It`s all cool that it`s raw since it`ll all going to get cooked anyway, but the risk for contamination is unnerving. If someone puts the tongs back in the chicken juice and someone else goes to grab that tong and then another tong and another, those chicken juices will be on every tong and spoon. I know I`m quite the germaphobe so I`m sure not many are thinking in terms of contamination, but I definitely recommend washing your hands after the cooks finish your food.<5<1<2016<3<17<4

Unlike the Thrifty employees at the airport in Kauai, they didn`t hold Alan hostage while he signed up for the car.  Even better, as the three of us walked through the parking lot in search of a car, a man, obviously an employee, possibly a manager, pointed to a silver Altima and told us it was '"the pick of the litter'".  So we took it.  Had it not been for the interminable wait to get out of the parking lot, the four stars would have been much stronger.  There were two lines to leave.  Unfortunately we got in the slow one.  It took 10 or 15 minutes while the man in the booth checked out the 2 or 3 cars in front of us for dings, dents and such.  He seemed to have difficulty w/ the iPad/computer technology involved.  Had we chosen the other line we would have been on the road much faster, but we didn`t.  The car itself was comfortable, clean and reliable.  When we returned it the woman who checked us in was friendly and efficient.

They were renovating when I stayed but was not told about it when I booked my hotel.  Smelled paint fumes throughout the day.  The grab and go breakfast was bad dry muffins and granola bars sums up what you get.  If you want new towels u have to bring down your old towels before getting new ones and dishes u have to go down and get a tub of dishes then bring the tub back.

They offer '"buffalo mild'" and some other flavors but buffalo is just '"mild'".  I was told that they could make them hot on request, so I did.  What I ended up getting was the the sweet hot wings that were yellow in color.  Very sweet, definitely hot, but I don`t like sweet chicken wings.  They definitely didn`t taste like any buffalo style I ever had.  They didn`t look like the buffalo wings my neighbor at the bar was eating, which were red.  I figured that the kitchen got the order wrong.  I ate some of them, paid for them, and moved on with my life, even though I was disappointed.   Came in today and I ordered buffalo mild.  I asked about making them hot and the bartender said they only come in '"mild'". I said, '"OK,  I`ll take mild, cuz last time they sent me some yellow, sweet hot wings and I don`t want that.'"  When my wings arrived and they were yellow.  I asked the server if they were buffalo.  She went and checked and said the kitchen says they`re buffalo.  I said, '"they don`t look like buffalo,  where`s the red sauce?'"  I tasted them.  They were sweet.  I`m not paying for them twice.  I sent the wings  back this time. I didn`t order anymore food today.  Fool me once, right?   Either, '"A'" they messed up my order twice, or '"B'" their buffalo wings are sweet, which makes no sense.  Either way, I`m not gonna order their wings again.  Their charcuterie board was good. Their beers are good.  Service is good.  Maybe the kitchen has a communication issue when ordering wings?  I dunno."<5<11<2019<23<44<37
kkYhJ7e_Oko54N6gMFR-6Q<ylTmq1dqxaWYhrKbzdnLug<kDcF-tbOlN-uIhSFMF-EKQ<1<1<0<0<"I have never left a Yelp review, but today`s experience made me want to warn others about this company`s predatory practices in regard to labor costs for installing a 50-gallon water heater. I did not have any work performed by this company today, but they certainly attempted to rip me off to the extreme. I will start with the positives:  POSITIVES: My previous water heater was installed by this company in March of 2010. It was a 50-gallon Westinghouse medium-height unit. The cost was about $700 or so. I also used them another time for outdoor spigot work - also a positive experience. Fast-forward to August 2019, I realized that my hot water heater was in need of total replacement and contacted City Wide Plumbing of Tempe from the road on August 14, 2019. Since I was traveling and did not have physical access to the water heater, I was hoping that they could pull my paperwork from 2010 and install a similar unit on Saturday August 17th, after my return home. Stacy (or Stacey) was very helpful and informed me that they only had paper records from that far back. Totally understandable. She tried to pull the records but could not. When she called back, I arranged to have a tech come out Monday. On Monday morning, Lou P. arrived about 15 minutes early and gave me his card. This is where a decade of positive experiences with this company ends...  NEGATIVES: Lou entered the garage, had a look at the existing water heater and gave me a price... $1310 and some change!? I asked Lou how much of that was labor and he showed me a cost sheet that listed the price of the unit at $388 (but he said the price of the unit had gone up since the time of printing - but obviously still one of the cheapest units available.) I am not sure exactly what I said, as my head was spinning at the time... I do know that I calmly dropped a single F-bomb - something along the lines of '"I am going to have to pass, as $850+ labor is absolutely F`ing ridiculous...'" I would like to apologize to Lou for my crude language, but I swear that I was not in total control of my faculties at this point... This quote was for the absolute bare-bones dual 4500-watt electric water heater. I did some online research and discovered that the job is generally about a two-hour job, but can take up to 4 hours with mitigating circumstances (of which there were none.) That means that City Wide was attempting to extort between $200-400/ hr in labor from me! I am not completely sure how the total price can even be given before hours of labor have been determined?! Unbelievable.  TAKEAWAYS: I think I made the mistake of telling Stac(e)y that I was not shopping around and just wanted a fair price. I had used them in the past and was hoping that it was the only call I needed to make... After my online research, I actually called her back a few hours after Lou left. First, I apologized for wasting the company`s time. Then I asked how they justified $900 in labor to install an electric water heater. She said that they do not charge $900. At that point, I remembered to factor in sales tax on parts (no tax on labor/services in AZ) and rounded down to $800 labor. She told me '"Yes. That`s our book rate. $1300 for a water heater...'" I said '"Okay then,'" and ended the call.  The good news: I ended up buying a Rheem Gladiator 50-gallon, 5500/5500-Watt Smart Electric Water Heater with Leak Detection and Auto Shutoff from Home Depot for $675 out the door. My handyman and I installed it ourselves in about 3 hours. I actually could have done it myself if I knew the only soldering/sweating was on the exhaust pipe from the emergency pressure overflow and not on the intake... Even if I hadn`t done it perfectly, who cares! It`s an emergency pressure-release that exhausts outside my garage...  BOTTOM LINE: Total savings w/handyman labor = $400+ and for a much better hot water tank! Details below:  - Dual 5500 kW heating elements (versus the 4500 kW unit quoted) - added 12-year warranty versus maybe 6 years on the barebones quoted - added Leak Detection - added Auto-Shutoff - added Wi-Fi app (can adjust temp from anywhere - vacation mode, etc.)  Thank you, City Wide Plumbing, for teaching me an important lesson.  Had it been winter, I may have just accepted your ridiculous quote. It turns out that I could shower in 100-degree summer water indefinitely - so I had no sense of urgency. I am quite sure that Lou would have finished the job in 2 hours or less. It was textbook simple. For the record, Payscale.com lists the average plumber hourly wage at $20.21/hour in Phoenix - fully 20x less than your quote of $400/hr!  https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Plumber/Hourly_Rate/3d18dbd5/Phoenix-AZ  Shame on you, City Wide Plumbing. I have no idea how you people sleep at night... Let The Buyer Beware."<20<8<2019<5<29<59

We got a new waitress and she kept me busy with a beer and my hand, was quick to get my order, and checked up on me to make sure I was alright. I do kinda feel like the days and times you come in affect the service you get a bit. They have the Varsity Squad working Thursday - Saturday afternoons and nights and JV working days and weekdays. However, it was a good experience eacheck other time ive come back. Only 1 times fid I have a run in with a hostess that had a attitude, but I didn`t let her 1 min interaction ruin my experience.

JvacHbO4h06xiInRN5LZSw<bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw<h8mj8eJs-i3dGDuUlYrLLQ<4<23<10<23<Palace Station recently underwent extensive renovation, opening several new restaurants- Boathouse is the first one I`ve tried so far. Visited for their AYCE promo (expired end of May) and HH (2-6PM daily, bar only), having sushi both visits. Their full menu includes additional entrees and sides of more traditional Asian dishes- the market price whole crab and iron pot rice look amazing.   AYCE sushi is definitely not new in Vegas but the menu here was cheaper ($17pp vs $20+ elsewhere). The lower price corresponds with a more limited menu, with less nigiri options and very few sides/apps. The spicy tuna roll, while on the basic side, was very fresh. Some rolls are more innovative, like the Trumpzilla with chili threads on top. The fish was fresh but not great quality, salmon was oddly only available smoked (like what you would pair with a bagel, not traditional sushi). This special definitely put it on my radar and persuaded me to visit the new business. Might be worth keeping around to drum up business between lunch and dinner.  HH is limited to bar area only, and is a more concise list of the AYCE menu- about six half price rolls and half off specific drinks. I found it odd that apps like their poke tacos were not listed here. Not bad pricing for grabbing a quick bite with a friend or a light dinner before hitting the movie theater upstairs.   Service on both visits was warm and polite. Ambiance is modern and clean, private room available for groups or parties. Entrance by the movie theater is the closest to this restaurant.<3<6<2019<2<52<17

kw8firICsQIMR0GBticcdg<w_Qf4Wz0JykrYJx5mHWBag<0-pZqYbs2Qwycrjsyvq4hQ<1<34<0<1<"This review is based on two years of experience with multiple departments and staff within Mayo Clinic Scottsdale and its family practice.   The first thing you need to know about Mayo Clinic Scottsdale is they have a documented HISTORY of:  1. non-qualified, non-educated, non-licensed convicted felon treating patients; and 2. have a history of changing documents to cover-up inappropriate action and behavior.  It is critical for anyone who is considering seeking treatment that you carefully read the article '"Blind Trust by John Dickerson (google Blind Trust mayo clinic) that supports these serious and frightening claims before trusting these people with your health, safety and possibly your life.  Given the egregious behavior of past activities (with Mayo leadership well away of the behavior), it is fair to ask WHAT ELSE are they doing that has just not yet been exposed. My experience supports this. First, Mayo staff have a whole lot of attitude but not much substance.   Some examples from my direct experience:  Trying to schedule an appointment is a nightmare. Weeks of waiting, if you can get in at all. Even when referred by a Mayo doctor, I have waited weeks to get a call back and when I reach out, I`m told I just have to wait till they get to me. Just plain rude, nasty people. 8-15 weeks is not uncommon.  Egomaniac doctors who in my experience cannot (or are so arrogant would not) articulate a coherent treatment plan after multiple visits. A complete waste of time and money.  Doctors don`t respond. On several occasions, I have tried to communicate with a physician to clarify a medication or follow up on a test only to have the assistant (who plays doctor) respond, and in most cases, it was incomplete or inaccurate information.  Very disturbing - I have experienced AGGRESSIVE, THREATENING BEHAVIOR from Mayo staff when requesting information (they don`t want you to have or they don`t like you asking), verifying medial licenses, (which given their history you should do for every medical person you see, nurse, doctor, tech etc.), or even requesting records.   Medical records are not maintained accurately. After critical information in my file was not passed along to the specialist, I asked and was told by the family practice doctor, '"the system must have stripped it out'" when I did the referral. REALLY, the Mayo systems are that messed up that if DELETES specific and/or random medical notes and information, or are the physicians carless?   These experiences and others indicate to me that what was seen in the horrendous experience noted above continues within the Mayo organization to one degree or another. I don`t think anyone, including me wants to be the next victim.  On a positive note, the main facility is very nice and there is ample parking - but that does not buy quality healthcare!  If you are going to risk it here are some guidelines:  1. Record every interaction, THEY DO, and it is not for your benefit. Protect yourself - they are not looking after you, they are looking after themselves.  2. Put everything in writing and keep copies, even if you send it via the patient portal - remember how data gets changed, stripped, lost etc.  3. Be a self-advocate or better yet, bring someone along you trust and who can take notes  4. The Mayo Clinic Patient Rights is a joke and the Office of Patient Experience is a bigger joke-consider them Mayo Clinic Legal department whose job is to get in front of and gather information for pending lawsuits.   Don`t get swept up in the Mayo brand, there are many excellent doctors and hospitals in the Phoenix area.   Take the time to read the article '"Blind Trust by John Dickerson (google Blind Trust mayo clinic) and make an informed decision about who you want to trust with your healthcare and share this with the people you care about."<15<1<2018<15<57<56

I was very interested in bringing my family and I to this dentist, as it`s right down the street from where we live. I left work for my dentist appt and arrived a few minutes late,  not much. Because I had to fill out paperwork, I was told they would not see me, as they were going to lunch at 1 pm. I was told to reschedule an appt.  This was pretty frustrating considering I left work for the appointment. I am a very patient person and have never left a negative review of a business. The customer service was horrible. The ladies at the front desk were not welcoming in the least. To be fair, I never met with the dentist.   I have no idea why they would schedule me at 1215 if the dentists needed to be out of there by 1. It would seem they`re not interested in new patients. I`ll take my family elsewhere.<13<11<2019<20<53<19

We went a couple years ago when it first opened and had great food, but it has really gone downhill.  THE FOOD: Biscuits and Gravy. The biscuits are listed as jalapeno, but there was no jalapeno flavor at all. The gravy was decent. The roasted potatoes were not cooked enough and were too raw to cut with a fork.  The Benedict with crab. Obviously canned crab meat, and the hollandaise had a day-glo orange look to it, almost as if it had been made with Tang. The hollandaise flavor was off as well. And again, the same with the potatoes.  Belgian waffle. Decent. It`s kind of hard to screw up a waffle.   SERVICE: The service was good. Attentive without being annoying.  It is definitely a place where the annoying of Scottsdale seem to flock to. I was expecting to see cameras come in to film an episode of Real Housewives of Scottsdale.

I have terminated the management with Mountain park back in July 2019. The reason being the payment every month 50% of times are late. They say either is there system is going wrong or manager is out or something like that. To repair a door knob cost over 400 dollars( the knob wasnt even changed), clean bird shit in balcony cost 130 dollars. Just think if one of the tenant break a fridge or something, I can`t imagine the price for that.  Right now, Mountain Park still owns me one month of rent, after email multiple time, they just tell me they are going to contact the accountant. Well, I havent received anything from the accountant for two weeks.  Let`s talk about the communication with them. They did not prove me with a phone number and only email. So they can choose not to reply at all, this instance happened in March where I send almost 4 follow up emails with no response(still have the prove). How about their office? Nobody will talk to you (except the receptionist) unless you have made an appointment, well you can`t make appointment if they choose to ignore you right?

I was left with an AC unit I couldn`t turn on without freezing and a high pitched scream coming from the AC unit itself.  I called and they admitted to the improper installation and offered to come out and fix it.  Once they finally came out the technician refused to do the work and said he would have to have his office manager approve the parts!!  After going back and forth (and them closing the ticket as a completed job with the home warranty) they said they could only come out during another work day between the hours of 8-12 then stay for a 4 hour job (this would be the 4th time they came to the house and 4th personal day from work).  When I threatened legal action regarding the situation AJ, teh receptionist,  laughed at me and said '"go head'" he also refused to contact me with a manager or owner when I requested.

When we started to order our food, the servers came by to let us know that we had a 2 hour limit to dine, which I thought was pretty fair.   We started ordering and started off with the Kalbi tacos. The presentation of these tacos was a bit underwhelming and they tasted bland. The hot sauce that comes with these tacos is pure heat so use it with caution.  For our sides, we ordered the Spicy Pork Egg Roll and the Unagi Mini Dolsotbap. The egg roll had great savoury flavour but I didn`t really like the texture of pork meat in the egg roll. The dolsotbap was really tasty. The rice was seasoned with a brown sauce, giving it a savoury taste. It had a variety of vegetables and a piece of eel. It was a nice compliment to the main dish: Pork Ribs with Corn Cheese. This item is actually only available from 5-8:30 everyday so make sure you eat during this time!  We chose the sweet soy ribs as our base flavour. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone soft while the cheese was light. The cheese + rib combination is probably one of the greatest inventions ever as I happily dipped each rib in the melted corn cheese. The ribs were slightly bland but the dish overall was very enjoyable.  The fusion style dishes here at Han Ba Tang were definitely worth the try.<18<8<2019<17<26<43

We moved in soon after they opened and everything was awesome at first as they were trying desperately to fill their 50% vacancy. Amenities are next to none. Brand new modern apartments are very appealing. HOWEVER as as the apartments filled, the uncovered parking spots completely disappeared. Coming home at any time of the day or night you will not be able to find a spot. Also, as they filled, they jacked up their monthly rates. The rate we had moved in at was far gone.  Understandable, it`s a business. However, this gave them incentive to clear out as many current residents as they could in order to get people in at these newer, higher rates. To put it into perspective, when we moved in just a few months after they opened, they had only been offering 12 and 16 month leases so really no one should have been moving out yet. Unfortunately staff and maintenance looked for any and every reason to make it impossible to stay there. They are NOT as they say '"pet friendly'". We were contacted by staff that we were being given a 10 day notice to vacate the apartment because our dog was unaccompanied on the patio. During my frequent subsequent visits to the office I overheard Cindy on the phone giving the same speech she gave us word for word to several other residents. We were told to let our dog defecate and urinate INSIDE our apartment rather than let her onto the patio. As first responders, my partner and I are gone long hours and upon move in we were told that allowing our dog to access the patio while we are away was acceptable. It was the deciding factor upon choosing to live here. At just 6 moths after opening and with the only available choice being a 12 month lease agreement, no one should have been leaving yet. But people started moving out like crazy. Many of the friendly neighbors we had gotten to know were gone. It was either leave or get rid of your pets. We were all allowed out of our leases without penalty as truly they were going against our lease agreement. We had 10 days to figure out where to live or get rid of our beloved pet. Staff is less than helpful with any issues you might encounter. This place is slimey and I am so disappointed as I was beyond excited to move in here. Don`t make the same mistake we did, stay away from this place."<30<7<2019<22<17<28

The numerous infractions and red flags at Ken Shaw Toyota Scion were astonishing. We did our research and came prepared knowing exactly what we wanted. What we were not prepared for, was having to deal with 4 different people representing this Toyota Scion location and having to experience such appalling customer service.   The original sales person we dealt with wasn`t available the next day we came back so we had the unfortunate misfortune of encountering a different one that would grace us with her abrasive and disgusting condescending attitude throughout the rest of the purchasing process. Pricing was negotiated for 2 NEW cars in SPECIFIC trims and colours, but they didn`t even check stock and added the '"subject to availability'" stamps only right before the bill of sales were signed and the deposits were taken for both cars. Lo and behold, NEITHER of the specific trims and colours were available, so they tried to sell us one in a lower trim and different colour; while offering another one that was the correct trim and colour but was a DEMO/USED car. When we asked about availability outside the GTA/in other provinces, they said '"to transport them in, it would cost an additional $1000 per car'". Why would you enter into a binding contract for product that you knowingly REFUSE to fulfill? They barely budged on the price of the demo (which was close to the cost we originally negotiated for it NEW) and when a relative said no, a MANAGER walked in and had the NERVE to interject '"if it`s just the one car on the table then we will have to ADD $200 to its cost'" (despite the fact it was for a lower trim and different colour since they refused to transport in the new cars and fulfill the original purchase agreements). The sales person actually had the audacity to say '"we are doing you A FAVOUR by even offering you the demo because we normally don`t release demos until they hit a certain number of kilometres'" - basically giving us the take it or leave it attitude. You`ll know this particular sales person is getting agitated when she flares her nostrils and this happened practically every time we asked a question. She also added that she was doing us '"A FAVOUR by giving us discounts on the rust proofing'" when in actuality, the negligible discount was due to the fact the finance guy initially said that there were '"no additional fees to bring the cars in for rust proof checks every 2 years to maintain the 10 year warranty'" - when in fact, there is a fee and it was their ERROR. Speaking of the finance guy, he was a special gem as well. On the new bill of sale, he DOUBLE CHARGED me for the new license plate fee and when I pointed out the discrepancy, he SLAMMED his pen on the table in an outburst of frustration because he had to re-do it before I would sign - 2 other family members witnessed both his deplorable conduct and this sales person`s attitude. I had a companion with me the day I went to pick up the vehicle who witnessed the exchange when I asked to take the car for a quick lap around the neighbourhood - her response: '"YOU CAN`T DRIVE THE CAR. UNTIL YOU GIVE ME THE CERTIFIED CHEQUE, YOU DON`T OWN THE CAR!'" Absolutely unbelievable!! Only an inexperienced, disrespectful '"professional'" would give this type of response.  So to conclude; yes, as their slogan states: they`re '"family run, customer driven'" alright. More like driven to DRIVING CUSTOMERS AWAY. It`s a sick joke that a manager had chances to right what transpired but didn`t and instead went out of his way to add to the negative experience. That said, I`ve been doing this dealer '"A FAVOUR'" by telling anyone with ears how HORRIBLE my experience with this dealership was. (I should also add that some of these people are currently in the market for new vehicles as well). So, if you`re looking for shady business practices and abrasive, combative, disrespectful customer service, this place is for you. Had there been such a thorough review of this place beforehand, I would`ve avoided it like the plague. Anyone reading this review would be doing themselves '"A FAVOUR'" by taking their business elsewhere."<26<12<2015<4<26<56

You may also want to take into account that even with a reservation they might not be ready for you to order until 5-10 minutes after your reservation. It is not hard to see why they are such a popular place to be however and I definitely recommend going here if you are looking for a creative combination of healthy and high quality ingredients.  The '"gathering board charcuterie'" had an interesting assortment of crispy pickled vegetables, a touch of preserved meat, local honey (with the honey comb and all), olives,  three  different cheeses (cheddar cheese, mustard cheese and blue cheese) and just two brick oven baked crackers which I kind of wish they had more of.  My absolute favorite was the special, which included sea scallops with yellow tomato gazpacho, apple and kohlrabi salad, pickled shallots and lemon oil. The scallops were huge and cooked to perfection and the other ingredients were super light and refreshing. You felt healthy after eating it and it was something I never would have thought to make at home.  I also really enjoyed the vegetarian option, which included brown rice fritters with roasted vegetable black bean hash and horseradish cream. Super yummy and healthy at the same time. The fritters were nice and crispy without being too oily and the generous serving of vegetables were also very flavorful.  None of the food was too heavy. Even the shrimp corn dogs and tiramisu were light and fluffy.  Although the prices were good for the quality of the food I do wish the serving sizes could have been a bit bigger... I definitely would not have felt full without also ordering an appetizer and dessert."<11<8<2019<5<40<21

Our server was very friendly and checked on us frequently throughout the night. They also let us make the most of happy hour right before 6 (which is 3-6 PM Monday through Friday and all day Sunday). We ordered the cheese curds and pot stickers ($2 off each during happy hour). My husband had a glass of wine (house wine $3.50) and two beers (can`t remember the special for these). We also ordered a side of fries and I ordered the french onion soup. Finally, I had the creme brulee for dessert. I`d say all of the food was really good. I`d say the only downside is that the prices are a little expensive, but that would be my only complaint. The ambiance is great. I loved the lit lanterns and the brick walls. I would definitely recommend Lulu`s 13 Pub. It is nice to have a restaurant in the area that isn`t a chain.<6<1<2018<15<35<11

Maaaaany late nights in North Hollywood getting the Cold Italian on my way home! When they left the LA area, I followed the Steel City Instagram and saw they had relocated to Las Vegas. As a frequent visitor to Vegas, I tried desperately for a year or two to get the timing right and show up at a pop-up but things never worked out.....  Fast-forward to last week, and I FINALLY got a chance to visit the Las Vegas location! I`m not going to lie....I was in heaven. There are genuinely few things that excite me as much as this did! Although not on the '"official'" menu, Taylor (owner) was able to make my Cold Italian sandwich....and I`ll be damned it tasted EXACTLY the way I remember it. The bread...the fries....the way the coleslaw and grated cheese cling together....I mean it was identical. Sourcing exactly the same ingredients to make it taste the same years later takes true dedication!!! It was great meeting Taylor (who I`m sure I met several times in LA but hey it was usually 2am and after the bar haha). She made my girlfriend and I feel right at home, and spent an hour talking to us about the move and new location.  I can`t stop talking about it....we have already planned a trip in January and I`m SUPER excited LOL. So Thank You Taylor for the amazing food and hospitality!

The food was good and the mimosa was pretty strong I got pineapple & oj (waiters recommendation) and it was pretty good. The food is fairly price and decently proportioned.

YOU CANT BRING ANYTHING BACK! In this age of advanced customer service where most retailers know the value of keeping shoppers happy, the Public Butter is sadly behind the times. The cashier`s attitude went from charming to confrontational to antagonistic when I inquired about trading in a garment I bought a few days earlier (for $100). She started the return process by shaking her head `no` before she even looked at the jacket, my tags and the receipt, and then proceeded to find more good reasons why NO was acceptable. But I insisted on getting some satisfaction (reminding her that this is the age of good customer service and this was an opportunity to make a maven out of a mud lark), and so she finally called the owner and together they decided that I had to return home and bring back everything I had purchased the previous day so that the validity of my claim could be appraised.  I did as she asked, retuning 2 hrs later to wait again as there was another phone call to the owner.  Finally it was decided I could replace the garment but the cashier reminded me loudly in front of patrons that this was highly unusual and such an act of kindness would NEVER happen again to me or anyone. I said `Okay I`ll be sure and let readers know your policies on Yelp when i write my review later today` to which she said `Thank you`... Because what else could she say? the irony is that I`ve probably spent over $1500 in that store over the years, as I love cool vintage clothes, But now I will avoid it and warn others away.<31<3<2014<20<7<43

It was a long and sometimes very discouraging process, but I can`t speak enough to the professionalism of Tiara, who did my hair.  She was patient and reassuring during the 8 hour process, and was always very honest about what could be done to achieve the hair color I wanted.  She has even addressed my concerns with my hair color through text over the past couple of days (it is dark so it`s bleeding like crazy and transfers to EVERYTHING), which she is totally not obligated to do.  My hair WOULD NOT take the light color I wanted, so after 5.5 hours Tiara asked me to come back the next morning to be sure that my hair didn`t look splotchy and ridiculous due to the lightening process and failed dye attempts.  I went back in and my hair is currently a very dark purple that will eventually fade to the lighter color I was hoping for when we started.  It`s a beautiful dye job, and even after all of the processing my hair went through to get it here, there`s very little breakage and my hair doesn`t feel dry and brittle.  This place is great, and I would definitely recommend booking an appointment with Tiara!  If she`s not available, everyone there was really great, and they were really helpful in getting my hair where it needed to be.<19<12<2015<22<17<18

Ordered drinks, quesadilla and fries for the boy, a shrimp cocktail, a ceviche tostada, and tostada embarazado.   Drinks came out and we asked for chips. Quesadilla and fries came next. Quesadilla tastes like old cooking grease.  Fries were great.  How does that even happen?  30 minutes later we are still eating the bunk chips and whack salsa and most the boys food. Some dudes are peddling necklaces and potato chips pretty hard on us. Feel like I`m trapped in a live telemarketing scheme.   They move a huge party right on top of us where they can`t sit without bumping into our chairs. Why would you do this?  Everything about this place is seriously nerve wrecking on all senses.  We see a booth open nearby and make a jump for it abandoning our rocky sailboat that is going under anyway with peddlers and a large party of cackling regulars.   Our food finds our new calmer vessel. We eat a bit and realize it all tastes exactly the same but in different forms.   Ask for a box and our check.   Completely abandoned ship and head out for safer waters.<14<7<2019<21<50<29

She still refused to make an appointment for only me. I told her I would call her back if I decided to schedule an appointment. The next day Stacy from Bath Planet called and '"wanted to confirm our appointment for Friday at 7:30 pm.'" I told her I had not made that appointment, that my husband did not need to be there, it was ultimately my decision, and that I found it insulting that they would not make an appointment with just me. Stacy went through a long explanation that it would it be a waste of company money to have to keep going back and forth to answer both my and my husband`s questions. I thanked her, told her we would not be using Bath Planet, and hung up. Then I called Reliant Capitol to confirm the appointment I had previously made through Home Advisor, and surprisingly this same Stacy from Bath Planet got on the phone and said they were both Reliant Capitol and Bath Planet and was quite rude, said I hung up on her.

The owner checked everything and said that the LCD was fine and the iPad would be ready in an hour. I went back and collected it and everything seemed to be working. When I got home I attempted to put the iPad into the case which I had always used on it. Just pressing on the screen to fit the iPad into the case completely messed up the LCD.  The following morning I took it back to tell them what had happened. The owner wasn`t there and so the employee informed me that damage to the LCD was not covered under the warranty is the screen and that it was caused by some trauma. I explained to him what had happened and he was immediately defensive and got a bad attitude just saying well there`s nothing we can do you signed the waiver saying everything was working and that it would be $149 to fix it.   I asked him for the owners number, I asked him to call the owner, I asked him to explain what could have caused the LCD to get messed up simply by fitting it into a case, I asked him to speak to another employee and I asked him when the owner would be back in. He refused to answer any of my questions. He told me he was the only one there (which wasn`t true because when I went to my car another employee came out front). He told me he wouldn`t call the owner and that he wouldn`t '"disclose'" to me when the owner would be back.   After taking the iPad elsewhere to have it checked they found that a piece of glass had been left inside when replacing the glass which had in turn damaged a wire and messed up the LCD when we pressed down on the screen.

While at the bar, your bartender Alex was remotely friendly, as he watched the clock, desperate to check out. His short sentences and constant asides as he graciously served your expiring seafood buffet to his coworkers via to-go boxes. Hush hush of course. And on the Q-T. Quite underwhelming considering I`m supposedly at a 5 Star Hotel.  I didn`t appreciate the restaurant hall monitor asking me if I had paid for the said seafood buffet either. Real amateur hour here.  The front desk avoided my questions regarding the numerous placards in the room describing what to do if stung by a scorpion...which seems quite common here.   Didn`t like parking in a structure a mile away, and fudging for payment each time I entered and exited...to avoid a retarded $27 valet charge. Give me a break.  The parking is more suited to a ghetto hotel in South CHICAGO.  Frank and Alberts buffet breakfast ($25)...if you`ve smelled feces a few times you know how it tasted.  I could go on and on. But I`ll sum it up.  Wonderful grounds. Service that you may find at a Motel 6. Hilton owns this you know.<15<6<2016<20<35<11

I love this place! Yes, I know I said it twice.   One thing I`ve noticed is the low turnover with the staff. It`s always the same people working and they remember me and are always friendly. I also think this is why food is always consistently good.   I think they have the best hot sauce!<13<9<2018<0<38<50

The salads are healthy and delicious. There is really nothing not to love! I usually get the V12 salad, which is packed with goodness and love. I have also gotten the cobb, which has adorable rows of all the toppings so you can eat them individually or mix it all up. The only thing you have to do is ask for 9 grain bread otherwise you will get a hunk of a corner piece of the sourdough (I think that`s what it is?), and its a little tough to chew.

TBOjaV3umXTScyy5fk8lkA<uoPBjjNfH6oAkQY_qYfmEA<taSRrjQs0O7pnzd5oiQx7Q<5<0<0<0<BEST RAMEN IN TOWN!  Of all the ramen places I`ve tried, Isshin hands down is my favourite. It`s the Bugatti compared to Kenzo or Kinton. Authentic Japanese ramen and food. The first time we went we did the lunch combo ramen, the spicy red ramen and spicy sesame ramen were delicious. Noodles were perfectly chewy and tender, broth was rich and fragrant. The second time we returned the next day as my boyfriend was craving ramen but I wanted something different so I ended up getting a rice dish. I know know, how weird to order rice at a ramen shop, but let me tell you it is the BEST meat on rice type dish I have ever had. The marinated pork was so incredibly flavourful, the rice is always tender and the egg yolk breaks into the rice  There`s something about a joint that nails ramen and rice dishes. Oh and the service is impeccable- the servers are super friendly!! What more do you want??<6<11<2019<18<46<57

It was a quiet afternoon, not a lot of patrons in the restaurant. The service was smooth and accommodating, not overly friendly. They served a small piece of dense bread with olive oil and balsamic which was good, not great. I started with the calamari which was really good! Next a had the caprese salad, this had great flavor but I`ve definitely had better. I`d go back for lunch but I doubt I`d choose Buddy`s for a nice dinner.<6<11<2019<23<34<52
RUoxqDiFq0at6CFg99uXuw<3tCzdXFXke958utEjcSdmg<Qf6EnIzKqhXQg4YNkVAqHQ<1<1<0<0<Came on a Monday afternoon. Ordered the Lobster Lovers Dream. Shrimp & Lobster Alfredo with a poached lobster tail & a broiled lobster tail which was like eating a Rubber band plus it was actually tasteless. It was inedible. Back it went. The cook came out to say he would never cook the tail using a broiler as it comes out tough but that`s the cooking method Red Lobster insists all chefs cook such a beautiful succulent tail. They turn it into the consistency of Squid or Octopus with no salt or pepper. So my 2nd tail was no better then my 1st tail. In fact I didn`t eat it & wasted $36.00 on a dinner that sucked. We were not compensated & all our waiter said was SORRY.  With so many wonderful restaurants in Vegas we won`t be back. One small lobster tail & Alfredo is not worth $36.00. I`m done wasting money on food that you cannot eat because of a cooking policy/method. The total bill was over $100.00 with tip. It`s a shame I wasn`t told when I ordered this dish that my lobster tail would be very tough & tasteless. The server knew this, it`s his responsibility to let the customer know your not going to be able to eat your LT......IF You Want To Feel Ripped Off By All Means Eat Here.....<29<1<2019<4<25<39

The chef was also the cashier and order taker. I went to this place with a friend who owns a restaurant and is familiar with health codes. we sat down and he shot off 10 violations instantly. However because we were on foot I decided to look past that.   The guy who took my order and was wearing latex gloves with the finger tips cut off. He proceeded to prepare my breakfast with his hands which I did not see him wash. He proceeded to place the different items of my breakfast onto the cooking surface still with his assumably dirty hands.   I asked for a water and when I got my water there was some nasty white stuff on the inside of the cup so I asked for another and got the look. As if I was an alien or something.   My food finally came and the meal was disgusting beyond words. I ate just enough to hold me over until the next day and asked for the check. The guy said 18 and change! Whatttt! All because I ordered an extra side which the man had told me the meal came with 2 sides. Apparently only 1 side was included. So a $9.99 meal jump up to $18.xx.   Absolutely ridiculous!  I never leave reviews for restaurants but this was so terrible that I feel responsible to do so.<7<11<2019<3<7<15

My Nashville Hot chicken was very good, tasty and moist.  Actually I would have liked it to be a little hotter/spicier but it was still very good.  A nice small organic mixed green salad was a perfect side.  Choose the Mac & Cheese for my other side and it is better than most places.  All in all a good choice for our dinner.<15<8<2019<14<52<30

Also the one waitress was doing her best on Saturday but my gosh just get her some help ! Lastly (not endorsed by the bar just an observation) , odd thing - seems to be a meeting place for '"customers seeking ladies of the night '" .

Sadly this one lands in the miss category.  I ordered the ham & eggs biscuit with country gravy. I can`t even describe the flavor of the gravy. Well I can but it would be weird...Play-Doh weird lol. The scrambled eggs were a bit tough and so was the biscuit. On the upside, the biscuit had a decent flavor despite being tough and the ham was easily the best thing about the breakfast.  Breakfast isn`t their strong suit in my opinion or maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. Hopefully dinner is a lot better.  Breakfast 4/4/2018<15<11<2018<23<49<25

Once our orders were placed we received our milkshakes and drinks 1st (which was normal) however the shakes were only half full and my vanilla shake had no whipped cream. The waitress never checked in on us and we were completely done with our shakes before our food came out. This was with us telling our waitress that we had limited time as a result of us having to leave for the airport right after. We even had our suitcases present.

jYaTTWZ2M8EUCLXvAQx__A<-tBJZffckiQC6zhPlwVpVQ<WuBb_tGAJpddcwo9OnDQIg<3<2<0<0<"I`ve been resisting this review because I had a mixed experience and don`t want to '"bash'" either of the girls who worked on my hair.   My hair appointment was at 9:30am. I had requested a graduating senior to touch up my roots, add high and low lights and to cut and style my hair. I knew in advance that I wanted a lot of things at once and was prepaed for a long day, even brought a snack.  A graduating senior spent 4 and 1/2 hours on the color and wash. As she was washing my hair she told me she wasn`t feeling well and that someone else was going to cut my hair. Say what??!!! She said not to worry because she had told the girl what I wanted done.   ... The girl who cut my hair was NOT a graduating senior- no where near. Her instructor had to teach her each and every step. The girl had to keep stopping to look for the instructor and she still messed it up. Ridiculous!!!! I asked for blended layers on the side and a short, stacked cut in the back (the top layer higher in the back and off my neck). She took so long cutting my hair that the other students went home. The instructor looked at my '"final'"cut and snipped some hair from the back. I asked for a mirror and it looked horrible!!! I had hair sticking out all over in the back and no layers on the side in the front like I had asked for. Both the instructor and student worked on the back of my hair at the same time. I asked how I would be able to do all that myself and the instructor said a flat iron might help, but didn`t do anything. Apparently , it was time for her to go home too, regarless of how my hair looked. I left at 4:30pm. 7 and 1/12 hours and my hair looked like crap?!  Where was the apology and offer to have me come back in to '"fix'" it??  I don`t want to return, but I bought two groupons for haircuts that I have to use before October. I called and found out I can sell them. Does anyone want to buy two haircuts for $27????"<23<7<2014<3<29<14

The lamb shank... tender, succulent... flavorful... not fatty at all... cooked perfectly.  What wasn`t new? The consistent quality of food and service. I`m not a vegan or vegetarian, but the eggplant stack is a favorite, especially if you`re trying to take it easy on your system after any heavy meals. You almost think it`s fried, but it`s the oregano coating baked crispy that fools you. Layered with tomato sauce & avocado, drizzled with wonderful balsamic, it`s something to try. That said, the salmon is also wonderful. If only we left room for dessert each time we come. If you ever see the dessert cart go by, you`ll think about coming here for that alone... but the food is hard to pass up.

The server came to take our drink order and reeked of old cigarettes - clearly he had just returned from a smoke break but the smell made me wonder if he bothered to wash his hands afterwards because it was rather pervasive at our table.  We had never been to Condado Tacos so weren`t versed on the way you order food there.  When we asked questions our server was snarky and short in his responses, acting like we were idiots because we didn`t understand how to fill out the order form.  I asked what the difference between the '"sauces'" and '"salsas'" were as they were different categories on the form - he said it was a weird question.  I wonder if he knows `Salsa` means `sauce` in Spanish.  It was $21 for queso, guac and pineapple salsa with chips.  I asked if we could get some sort of salsa roja and was told no - that was extra because it wasn`t an option with that item.  First of all - $21 for chips and those things is ridiculous - secondly, you can`t get just plain red salsa with it????  The tacos finally showed up - they were lackluster at best.  They were cold.  They weren`t delicious at all.  Just barely okay.  Finally, a fifth member of our party showed up a bit late and slid in on the bench next to another one of our party.  Our server scolded us and lectured us about how they usually don`t allow it but he would allow it '"this one time'" We all just looked at each other and rolled our eyes.  I won`t return.  There are a bunch of other good places in Pittsburgh and this place isn`t going to hurt for my business.  I think, coming from the west coast, we have pretty good Mexican food - this stuff was, as my close friend from Mexico would call it, Gringo food.  Boring."<19<11<2019<6<24<2

Should be juicy and flavorful, with a firm texture and a beefy flavor! Beans should not be like a dessert. Way too sweet! Do not let him con you. brisket cost about $3.50 to 4 dollars a pound. which is expensive for brisket but it`s one of the cheapest meat you can buy!

The last time I came here, I ate inside and the food was fine-- BUT the service was absolutely horrible. Won`t go into details about that last time, but that was a long while ago so you`d think things might`ve changed since then. But nope. Today I went through drive thru & the food was great! Everything was fresh! As for the service? Service wasn`t so great. We pull up, tell the person on the headset that we need a moment to look at the menu. And normally; at other fast food places, they`re like '"sure thing'" but the woman in drive thru today was too literal with it. Not even a few seconds pass and she`s like '"Are you ready to order?'" In the middle of  ordering, I wasn`t sure what soda to get so yes, there was a quick pause and she interrupts it with '"what do you want to drink??'" Wouldn`t have bothered me so much but she asked with an attitude. My boyfriend & I felt rushed to order. Also couldn`t understand what she was saying she repeated the order back to us, she spoke waaay too fast. When we pulled up to her window to pay, she didn`t say '"hello'" or greet us with a smile... nothing! Just a blank expression. The woman at the presentation window was a little better, she didn`t speak much but she at least smiled. All in all, I`m only coming here when I`m on a budget... or maybe just really desperate cause there`s other fast food places in the vicinity. Work on your customer service, y`all! Slow down as you speak to your customers, and smile. It`s not that damn hard."<22<11<2019<2<47<54

When looking up you could tell that the water was coming from a vent above our heads. It didn`t just drip in a little area on the table it literally splattered all over the five of us when it would hit. When our server finally came to greet us we were all standing up around our table, told her why and she said, '"we have a full house tonight so unfortunately we have nowhere else we can move you.'" We all just stood there staring at her with hopes of a solution. Nope, didn`t come. We asked her what we should do besides the obvious of either leaving or sitting under the water drip. She went and got several people , one seemed super annoyed and she just repeated what the server said, we repeated what we said so she grabbed the table and pulled it over just far enough away from the drip so it could just hit the floor. FEET UP PEOPLE! If we had not been so hungry we would have left. The food is not worth it people nor is the additional headaches. Stopped going here altogether.

Chantelle is very patient and understanding. She explains every procedure and treatment in great detail to make you comfortable. My first visit with her was a consult, where we decided to do a light brightening facial. Since then, I`ve done a few facials and a ViPeel chemical peel with her. My results have always been great!   Most recently, I went in for a microneedling session (for which I also bought a package). This was my first time trying microneedling, and I have to say I was a bit worried. However, Chantelle talked me through and efficiently prepares me. After leaving the numbing cream on my face for a reasonable amount of time, during the procedure, I didn`t feel a thing! Since then, I`ve also seen an improvement in my skin. I`m excited to go back for the rest of my sessions!<19<11<2019<5<42<35

He had not even taken the time to review my fiancé med records and kept asking her if she remembered different lab values(which were in the chart notes, if this clown bothered to review them before our consultation).  Shapiro asked her about the same lab values 3 or 4 times as if he forgot he asked her 5 minutes before. I don`t know about you but most people don`t memorize lab values taken weeks before. Again he was very robotic and aloof and was not really paying attention to what we were saying(when he let us talk or asked a question for the 3rd time).  When we were done, we both looked at each other and did not have to say anything as we knew we would not be coming back to this WEIRDO. Save your money, save your time and save some aggravation by passing on this place(don`t know about the other doctor(s) that work here but Bruce Shapiro is an oddball looking creep).

iSug9BuznJQg_Bo6ym5aVw<QGW7G1DLqBpBCbn3Ygtigg<K-uQkfSUTwu5LIwPB4b_vg<5<0<0<1<"Short version: Dined here this previous Saturday evening (after making a reservation more than a month in advance) during a girls weekend trip. Food was incredible.  Drinks were amazing. Service was stellar.  We were still discussing it 2 days later as one of the best meals we`ve had together!  Long (& rambling) version: We were a group of 5 ladies on our annual spa weekend getaway to sunnier southern climes before the Seattle gloom descends for the next 6 months.  This year we chose Scottsdale and definitely wanted one night to check out the happening Old Town scene.  I had a small list of foodie restaurants on my Yelp bookmark list- places I had read or heard about and after careful consideration and menu review, ultimately settled on Mission.  One of my friends has an extensive list of allergies and it looked like Mission could easily accommodate.  Plus they took reservations, while some of the other spots on my list (Virtu, FnB, Postino) either did not or were already fully booked.  FOOD & DRINK: We were seated in the small front outside patio, perfectly positioned to enjoy the pleasant evening temperatures.  Upon sitting and examining the menu, we all immediately decided to split the tableside guacamole which was too good to pass up.  Reminiscent of the molcajete-style tableside guac preparations I remember fondly from Mexican vacations.  They roll up a cart filled with the ingredients in separate bowls and proceed to mix to preference/taste. Ingredients include: avocado (claro!), jalapeno, red onion, fresh garlic, sea salt, lime, tomatoes, chipotle puree, cilantro, cotija (cheese), and roasted pepitas (a type of pumpkin seed).  We just asked for the cotija on the side in order to accommodate our allergy prone friend.  And medium spicy to accommodate some of my wimpy friends.  With this, I ordered the Primarita, billed as '"no sugar, 1/2 the calories, all organic'". Just the way I like it- only tequila, agave nectar, & pressed lime!!!  I love me a good margarita and if there is a mix involved then it is no bueno.  We were ready to move onto main courses after that and since we had stuffed ourselves full of excellent chips/salsa/guac, we (mostly) made the wise decision to stick with starters as our mains.  I could not pass up the grilled street corn (elotes) which they do on or off the cobb (I got off) and made my friends promise to share.  It was excellent- basically your typical charred street corn served around the world with a few tweaks (sweet corn, butter, chile, paprika, aji rocoto, cilantro, and cotija.)  I also could not pass up the Duck Carnitas Empanada, which I ended up having to take some '"home'".  (I am totally and completely innocent- asked the waiter how large the empanada was and he misled me to believe it was about half the size it came out as.  Plus with a super rich rich duck confit sauce drizzle and duck fois gras.  Ok... i should`ve known. But it sounded SO appetizing. And it WAS WAS WAS!!!  Besides what I already mentioned, menu description included orange habenero glaze, oregano, mushroom, and queso Oaxaca.)  My 4 amigas (respectively) got the duck verde entree, chicken tacos, steak tacos, and steak tacos.  They all raved too.  SERVICE: Stellar! One of my friends, whose purse was sitting on the floor, had a waiter come and bring a cloth napkin to put under it.  The same friend, sitting at the head of the table and far away from the one bowl of guacamole goodness, had another give her a little extra after he made the bowl for the next table because he felt '"she was so far away from it'".  All in all... a great experience to add to our collective sunshine memories!!"<15<11<2019<1<4<15

The women who pinned my dress was in training so her trainee apologized that it took longer (this I completely understand you have to start somewhere)! It did take longer then I thought so the trainee mentioned a coupon out front that she would apply to my purchase. I was surprised by the cost of a bridesmaid hem (61 dollars) the bride of the party said her gown cost $100 total. When I picked up the dress the women went back to find it and took 10 minutes or more. Then they said they couldn`t get the wrinkles out of my dress because the didn`t have the right iron for the job. I also had to mention the coupon multiple to multiple people. The staff was rude from start to finish and didn`t show a sense of urgency. Not a great experience. I`ll have to find another tailor.<10<10<2017<21<17<43

Its atmosphere is vibrant and truly takes you out of your average daily Cleveland routine and environment. Their drinks never disappoint, from taste to alcohol content (they are generous). I`ve never gotten their real food so I can`t attest to that but the appetizers are decent. The pain killers are loaded with alcohol and the scorpion bowls are always a fun kickoff to the night. You really can`t go wrong with any drink on the menu though, any one is sure to whiz you off to a delightfully inebriated tropical island.<28<11<2019<3<34<52

This place delivered.  The only reason I`m not giving it a 5/5 star review is because of the size of the restaurant and the lack of parking.   I recommend allowing at least a 30 minute wait before being seated. The line moves fairly fast but they don`t rush customers which is great. There are a few seats on an outdoor patio but most of the seats are inside. Parking is tough. Be prepared to park on a side street and walk   Food is yummy. I ordered the breakfast pot pie and the first bite was scrumptious. It contained all the ingredients of a traditional pot pie but with a breakfast flare due to the egg. I got mine over medium which was perfect.    On a future visit, I`d like to try one of their adult breakfast beverages with my meal. They offer mimosas and a whole, lot more.<1<7<2017<15<41<2

We order the Thai Basil with Chicken, Green Papaya Salad, and Beef Chow Mien Thai Style. For service, even though we order to go, I`d have to give them 5 out of 5. They gave each member of our family a scoop of green tea ice cream while we waited for our food! Food was well packaged and came with everything we needed which was helpful since we were going back to our hotel to eat our dinner.

At only $6.99, the burger with fries are unbeatable.  Cooked the way you like it, the patty is moist and flavorful and tasty when accompanied with two thick bacon slices.    We didn`t have the same service issues as last year, and thus the bump up to a four star rating. Our order was taken and food served in no time at all.     Also noteworthy was the salmon salad - a freshly prepared salmon fillet atop a bed of mixed greens, roasted pistachios and tossed in a sweet mango vinaigrette.  I ordered it cooked medium and it came out perfect!    In a tourist laden city, One Ocean is a great casual dining spot.

I made this reservation basically because my friend, who is a vegan(figures she would get one and not I...lol), received a promotional $50.00 gift certificate in the mail. She thought that the dinner would be complimentary as long as the bill came to $50.00 or less.  I explained to her the conditions on the back of the card...tax and gratuity not included.  When we were seated, I confirmed with our waiter(David) that the gift card was still acceptable(the promotion was extended for another month).  He assured me that it was and suggested that I put it away so that we may enjoy our meal.  For appetizer, my friend and I each had the delicious mushroom ravioli(the 3 large ravioli was enough for the two of us).  My friend`s dish was not hot enough and asked that it be reheated.  When it came back to her, she was satisfied with the temperature and the way it was prepared.  Keeping in mind to stay in budget, we ordered the salmon nicoise salad( a good portion of salmon filet, petite string beans, deviled egg, steak fries, grilled sweet peppers on a nice bed of greens) to share.  It was served to us on one plate with extra plates to split it ourselves( a little disappointing).  However, the 6 oz. salmon was cooked to perfection; everything was nicely seasoned and the colors and textures were pleasing to the eye and palate.  When we were finished with our meal, David mentioned that one of the appetizers was taken off as complimentary( a very nice offer, not sure why).  Naturally, we had to order dessert to keep the tab as close to the target amount.  So we shared the creme brulee(delish), and boy were we stuffed.  When the bill came, it was under $50.00.  I gave David the card and asked him to tell me what the difference would be.  He wasn`t sure, because the bill wasn`t high enough, but not to worry, he`ll figure something out.  Well, guess what?  The final bill was '"0'"... ZILCH ... NADA!!! We couldn`t believe it! I thanked him profusely; gave him a $10.00 tip, and complimented the manager on great service, staff and a very generous offer.

I can here on a weekday for their lunch special since I was in the area and sat down at the bar. Service was excellent! The place was comfortably full and starting to get their lunch rush in. The chips and salsa they give out are amazing! Definitely not your typical '"Mexican'" restaurant chips and salsa- the chips are airier and perfectly crunchy, paired well with the creamy avocado salsa or the other pepper salsa (can`t remember what`s in it but it`s good!). I ordered the salad and the taco al carbon, which comes with rice and beans for their lunch special of $11.99. Such a huge portion! I definitely took half home. The salad is well dressed and perfect for the hot weather. I would have been fine with just the salad- that`s how large the portion was. But let me tell you about the rice- it was to DIE for!! The best rice and beans I`ve ever had hands down! The taco al carbon wasn`t what I expected it to be like but it tasted really good as well."<9<5<2019<16<38<3

I saw their drinks on Instagram and with my mouth watering out of control based on the pictures, I knew I had to check them out.   Well, I was disappointed. I ordered the Cinnamon Toast Crunch shake and all I tasted was protein powder. The price of a shake also comes with a drink from their self-service station that carries about 4 neon colored Herbalife (no surprise there) refreshers.   I tried two flavors out (I believe these were cherry and mango) and both tasted artificial to me. I didn`t enjoy any of it. My friend ordered the fruity pebbles and dumped 3/4th of her drink. I didn`t want to waste money so drank about a half of mine before I had to admit defeat. Every sip was like drinking chalk. I really wanted to like this place so I`m pretty disappointed in my disappointment.   If you enjoy protein shakes then this may be the place for you!

Ive been here over a year and i have ONLY had hot water for 2 months out of the 14 months of being here. If it wasn`t for my credit I wouldn`t be here. I pay 1300 a month and haven`t been able to have a hot shower in months. They got down to the point where they said they would have to replace pipes to fix it and they`re not planning on that..My ceiling fan started falling out of the roof and when i had them come fix it they took my fan and never brought one back. Ive had a hole in my roof for 2 months. Corporate doesn`t answer. The office avoids you and maintenance has no idea which way is up. The crime rate here is ridiculous. Ive had my car ransacked 3 times.Cars get shot up here because they let drug dealers stay here. The pool was only available for May and June closed most of July and August. The washers only work sometimes and the laundry room is constantly being used for druggies to hide out in. Its a nice looking slum. STAY AWAY!!! POSTED DEC 2019<5<12<2019<14<48<12

My flight was not only delayed but my bag was destroyed by their employees. As I sat delayed in the airport I listened to their employees ridicule and make fun of passengers. I will never use this airline again ! I hope everyone reading this follows my lead !<11<12<2018<18<3<0

We sat in the lounge because the bar was full.  Our server came over and we ordered beers and sushi from the happy hour menu.  The food runner also gave us two glasses of water.  We then sat and waited, and waited.....and waited for our beers to come while others received their drinks.  I finally motioned to our server to come to our table and we asked on the status of the beers.  Her reply was '"they didn`t bring your beers?'"  Um, first off, YOU are the server and YOU are supposed to bring our beers, and secondly, do you see any beers on our table??  She then walked to the bar to fill our beer order, and while she was doing that, our first round of sushi came BEFORE our beers.  We ended up drinking water with the first few bites of sushi.  Strike one!!!  We ordered more beers and just like the first round, they were SLOW to come, and by this time the bar was empty and the lounge was not very crowded.  After another round of sushi (pretty good, but nothing to write home about) we asked for the bill.  We were in a bit of a hurry at this point so I plopped my credit card down so we could pay and go.  When our server returned with the processed credit card slip to sign, I took a careful look at the itemized bill, and here is where the SCAM occurred.  There was a $10.08 '"service charge'" added to the bill (STRIKE 2!).  That equates to about a 19% extra charge that was not explained by anything or anyone nor was it listed on the menu.  The second shocker was being charged $8 ($4 each) for '"sparkling water.'"   We did not order sparkling water, and the water they did bring and we drank (while waiting for our beers to almost never arrive) was TAP water (STRIKE 3 and you are out!!).    So, with an extra $18.08 of completely BOGUS charges, our '"affordable'" happy hour sushi experience was not very affordable any longer.  Needless to say, the server ate these charges via the tip we left her.  This place is a total scam!!"<5<11<2019<15<0<32

We sat in a booth next to a very tall window with brown wooden blinds. While eating, I looked at the blinds. They were filthy!!! There was a deep layer of dust on the windowsill, the blinds were splattered with food obviously from years of not being cleaned. Each slat was filthy, and I wondered what the kitchen must look like; I was afraid to look at the floor under the booth. Those blinds should be replaced! We will be traveling back to Charlotte, but will not bother to eat at Stone Mountain Grill again.

kM8TFEl-Ey6vpOdV-aEW2Q<tIXn4wYKnhryt2qmW6fQWA<dHgbL5EAEawIcqk6aXe2Ow<1<8<2<0<"I first came here a few years back. I remember the food was a bit old fashioned but decent enough. No overly negative memories.   Oh man, what happened. I have never had a restaurant experience where every single thing was bad. Yes, everything. From the staff to the food to the coat check. One of the worst experiences.   I was at Peter Allen`s this past Tuesday. I was there with someone to see a show at Heinz Hall. At the same time this sold out show was playing, Phantom of the Opera was playing as well. So the theatre district was very busy for a Tuesday. I originally wanted to take my friend to Proper, but unfortunately it was a huge wait, and that was the same for every restaurant in close walking distance. Except for Peter Allen`s. This should have been an omen.   We walked in and saw several empty tables. We stood for a bit before a rude older woman with long gray hair said we could be seated. Out of all of the empty tables, she brings us to the back wall, where we were seated at a very small table next to three other twosomes. Our waitress came and immediately I was turned off by her attitude. She just had the look of '"I don`t want to be here'". She announced that since she was taking care of us and the two friends next to us that she would just say the specials once and we all should listen. She then proceeds to read out a ridiculous number of specials. Way too many for one dinner service and got snippy when anyone asked her to repeat them. We took a bit of time to order apps and drinks. When we said we would need a few minutes, she rolled her eyes and left. We finally ordered the greens and beans app with the italian sausage and I ordered a vesper martini. Now I would usually order this drink with higher end vodka, and I suppose I forgot this time. But wow, the cheap house vodka they used made this drink taste like everclear, for $15. Boxed wine would have tasted better. The appetizer tasted strange. It was just kale, white beans, and sausage in sauce. Pretty sloppily presented as well. There were raw kale stems left in the app and the beans tasted like they came fresh out of a can without being rinsed. When she took it back only half eaten, our waitress didn`t say anything or asked about it. We then ordered dinner. My friend got veal parmesan and I got the bolognese. Now my pasta came with a salad or soup. BUT! It can only be house salad or soup, if you wanted any one on the menu it was extra.  So I decided on the french onion. Our waitress said again, '"You do know that will be extra right?'" Saying it in a way that she didn`t believe I could afford to spend the money. My friend asked for some pasta on the side, because this is one of the only italian restaurants where a parm dish doesn`t come with anything but the meat, covered in sauce and cheese. Again, we were reminded it was extra. After we assured her that we heard her the first three times, we then settled in to wait. And wait we did. For context, our show was at 7:30 PM. We got the Peter Allen`s around 5:30 and maybe had everything ordered by 6 PM. We did not receive dinner until 7 PM. An hour. For pasta and a piece of thin, fried veal. In between I was given my lovely french onion, that was so salty it was inedible. Upon flagging down our waitress and telling her, she just said oh I guess I`ll tell them then. Not, can I get you anything else? I`m sorry. Nothing.  When we finally got the entrees, to say they were mediocre is an understatement. My '"bolognese'" was literally their sauce, which was pretty much canned hunt`s tomato sauce, with some chewy ground beef and a carrot thrown in. Last time I checked, bolognese is a dish that is cooked down low and slow over time. This was terrible meat sauce that they called bolognese in order to charge about $25 for. It was highway robbery. As for my friend, her veal was overcooked and soggy. And her side of pasta was swimming in so much oil it looked like soup.   As a couple of side notes, there were out of almost every overpriced dessert, so really no one ordered anything. It is also worth noting that the tables near us also had issues with their meals, and looking around the restaurant, no one looked happy. Everyone looked frustrated or disgusted by their food. They were severely short staffed given the popularity of the shows going on that day. Also, don`t check your coat here. They store them right next to the kitchen where food is coming out.   In the end, I paid $95 for food I barely ate. Needless to say, our waitress barely got a tip for her awful service. When I got up to grab my coat, my waitress very haughtily grabbed my coat and said '"Here.'" when she handed it to me. This was while a woman next to me was asking to speak to a manager about the food and service.   I am sorry reader for this long review. I just happen to find it ridiculous that this '"restaurant'" occupies prime real estate and is able to serve this food with this level of service. Disgusting. Pittsburgh can do better."<2<3<2019<1<47<50

Nonstop laughter and audience involvement kept the crowd engaged the entire time. It`s very entertaining!   My kids and I are true Harry Potter aficionados so we were already pretty stoked for this show, we`ve read all the books and have seen all the movies numerous times. With that being said, even if you`re not too familiar with the books or movies you`ll still have a great time. Plenty of other familiar references which are hilarious. They even managed to work Les Misérables into the show, I couldn`t stop laughing.   I loved their depictions of each character and how they brought them to life with the silliest props. My daughter was called on stage during the quidditch match. That was definitely the highlight of her week!   Thanks guys for putting on such an awesome show. We absolutely loved it!<12<12<2019<17<39<49

aJzH7F-XMHuRruVFVTLbbw<4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w<RVQE2Z2uky4c0-njFQO66g<4<3<1<3<stopped by here a couple of Monday nights ago for dinner with my wife and her parents.  We actually ordered takeout online as we were taking the food to a trivia night.  Without knowing how long the food was going to take, we placed our order 45 minutes early only to find out that it was ready in 20 minutes or so.  As such our food was a little on the cold side whenever we got it but I know that is totally on me.  Since we did get takeout I can`t say that I noticed much of the restaurant.  Immediately upon entering there was a sign pointing the direction for takeout and we paid at a bar type area specifically for that purpose.  We quickly had our food and were on our way to trivia.  For dinner on this evening my wife and I decided to split the pimento cheese fries and then I went with a large plate of burnt ends which came with two sides for which I chose bacon wrapped jalepenos and hush puppies.  The menu described the pimento cheese fries as crinkle cut fries with homemade pimento cheese and brisket and then the burnt ends as crispy caramelized cubes of brisket tossed in cola BBQ sauce.  I first tried the fries which I thought were really good.  The cheese topping had made a single giant covering for the fries due to us picking them up late but still had a great flavor to it.  Then my burnt ends were a bit dry, presumably once again due to the fact that they sat for a long time.  Thankfully they still tasted good and I really enjoyed the cola BBQ sauce on them.  I imagine that both would have been even better hot.  As for the sides, the hush puppies were surprisingly light with a crispy exterior and soft interior which I totally dig.  Then the bacon wrapped jalepenos were a lot spicier than I was expecting but I liked the marriage between the salty/savory and spicy.  The bottom line is that I would head back here again in the future.  While I enjoyed all of my food here, the next time I would want to pick it up sooner so that I could enjoy it hotter.<5<12<2019<15<51<37
KT5x3i-y4P-ek9gOCbvxRA<6-tPgkG0erWML3t6gBPIXw<d9VoaIeHTt1t2H6n_jPZAg<1<0<1<0<The experience started out great.  I was helped on the phone by Jay and Toni.  I was told my tires would be in the next morning on a truck around 9am and I would receive a call to come in after they were unloaded by 10.  I waited until about 10:30am then called.  I was told yes that the tires were there and I could come in.  When I inquired about why I was not called, I was told that the guys responsible for inventory were not there.  So...I started off my experience already feeling like they didn`t care about my time.  I arrived and it took approximately 45 min to an hour to change four tires (expensive tires I might add).  During that time, I tried to recoup part of my day by making calls and appointments while I was sitting there.  After about an hour, I looked out the window and realized that my car was sitting in the lot. I approached the receptionist and asked her if my car was ready.  She said yes it was but that she did not want to interrupt my phone calls.  She NEVER got out of her chair to wave or nod.  It was clear that for some reason she was just perturbed that I choose to salvage part of my day by using my time wisely.  I asked her how long it had been ready.  She said 5-10 minutes but I had been off the phone for at least 5-10 minutes!  I told her I was pretty frustrated that there was no effort on her part to approach me knowing that I had already been delayed by them by 1.5 hours by not receiving a call.  No apology at all! I don`t have time to waste or the interest in giving my hard earned dollars to a company that is not respectful of my time.  Unfortunately for them, I have another four tires to replace on a second car this week.  I will not go back.<22<5<2017<17<7<30

Some places have pico de gallo at the condiments bar, but this place adds them to the tacos.  The filling in the tacos tasted like were pre-made earlier in the day, but this is an '"express'" restaurant so if you want fast this is the only way to do it.  I like the grilled chicken the best.  The meat had a great grilled taste.  The carne asada was my next favorite.  The meat was tender and flavorful.  Nothing was wrong with fish, but the coating wasn`t very crispy.   The tacos are $3.99 each. The tacos are pretty filling.  I was full after eating two tacos, but I managed to eat the third taco.    The condiment bar was pretty basic. They have several different hot sauces along with pickled vegetables.   I wish they had a sign telling me the burn level for each hot sauce.   ."<1<12<2019<1<30<33

Craig, Melvin, Jess, Sean, and Earl were the employees working the front desk during our stay and they went above and beyond to make sure all of our accommodations were met. From the moment we walked in, they made us feel at home and welcome. From ensuring a smooth and speedy check-in after a (very) long day of travel to replacing an accidentally deactivated room key, both situations that are usually dreaded by travellers, they took care of promptly and with a smile. Even when we were frantically preparing for our banquet and they were inundated with requests for toiletries and commissary items on Saturday night, they kept their composure and addressed every request. The next morning, when we were due to check out, one of our rooms` toilets was overflowing, but they professionally addressed everything and got us on the road on time. They made a stressful, long, and tiresome weekend so much easier just by greeting us with smiling faces every morning and evening. Craig particularly became a crowd favorite and made sure to wish us luck every morning and welcome us back every evening. Even when we were cramming dozens of people in the lobby and most other hotels would have told us to disperse, the staff was extremely understanding. Beyond the staff, the hotel was beautiful. Parking was a little hectic, but obviously that`s out of the staff`s control, and they did what they could to accommodate us. Would absolutely stay here again.<11<12<2019<6<59<6

If it wasn`t for the day`s ROTD, I wouldn`t have discovered The Magic Noodles. The restaurant is nice & clean but tiny, we were lucky we got a table right away but after the restaurant filled up quick. During this first we just went with the popular soup, C4-Szechuan Beef Brisket Noodle thin noodles for the other half and C7-Chong Qing Style Spicy Noodle with flat wide noodles for me. I really enjoyed our bowls of soup and loved everything about my bowl of soup, esp. the fresh noodles, the szechuan pickled veggies and spices. That bowl of soup sure hit the spot. I was happy to discover this business via Yelp and of course this will be a go to spot for me when we visit Vegas again.   Whats so unique about The Magic Noodle is that the Noodles are made and pulled fresh. The magic is in the fresh hand pulled noodle and how they are prepared by different techniques spices and ingredients to achieve the best in taste. Hand pulled noodles, knife slice and hand made are considered the best.   During this recent trip back in October, I had The Magic Noodle already on my mind, I wanted the same soup and same noodles, so we headed straight here once we got to Vegas. This time there was a line, we signed in and waited about 15 mins for a table. The Magic Noodle is very popular. We finally got our table, menu and I already know what I wanted, My husband and I wanted to get the same soup but the waiter broke the bad news to us that they ran out of that soup, so we ended up getting the chicken and mushroom with an order of fungus. Oh My Wow!!, I ended up loving this new soup, chicken & mushroom is my new faves. The fungus has a unique sweet & sour taste, I loved it, sure went well with my soup. I always get the flat wide noodles, so chewy, tasty and fresh!   I am super sad, just writing this review, I miss dining at The Magic Noodles. Overall, My other half and I both enjoyed our Soup Noodles, and I had a great experience. I can`t wait to be back again for more Noodle goodness!!<14<11<2019<1<35<1

They downsized a large number of employees leaving CNAs and other medical assistants extremely shorthanded. The nurst to patient ratio is unacceptable. There are a few caring employees, but unfortunately the majority does not seem to care for the patients nor the quality of their work performance. Part of the problem may be that nursing staff now have to care for patients and also work in the dinning room serving food and picking up dishes, as if caring for a larger number of patients wasn`t enough. The quality of the food, diapers, nutrution drinks, cleanliness, even TV chanel options deteriorated. Some of the other things I`ve recently noticed walking through the halls: it smells awful, the carpet is very dirty, and patient lights are constantly on while nurses are chitchatting ignoring patient needs.<3<8<2018<4<41<19

I had a fine consultation during which I explained to the doctor that regular braces were not going to be an option for me and I wanted to do invisalign.  He still continued through my treatment plan with me and explained that we could move forward.  After meeting with the staff member about pricing I left the office over an hour later thinking I was all set to start treatment.  Two days later I received a call from the office manager stating that I didn`t fit into the synergistic style of the office.  I`m still not quite sure what this means but I think that the doctor didn`t like the fact that I told him there was only one treatment option that I would accept.  I am a nurse and have been in healthcare for 12 years. I was not mean to the staff in any way while I was there.  Either way I would just be careful before you waste 1.5 hours of your life and are exposed to an entire work up including x-ray.<9<9<2011<15<28<44

We made a deal where I paid him cash and about 8 thousand dollars in brand new furniture including a big black and white leather sectional, 40'" x 40'" black lacquer coffee table with adjustable features for storage, walnut conference table with two leafs, glass/wood adjustable shelving units, BIFMA approved conference chair and high-end artwork. He wrote his contract by hand which included 9 thousand IG followers, Facebook posts weekly for one year and a furniture website with several categories and drop down menus. After six months he handed me a website where all the products were mumbled up in one single category called '"shop'". Now when a customer went to the site and was looking for a sofa or bedroom set ect... they would (if they could find it) start looking through office chairs, art, bedroom on and on, in an area named '"shop'". Plus the theme covered most of the photos only revealing the legs of a chair, corner of headboard, you catch my drift. When I started to get desperate for a website, I studied how to get it done myself because all he would do to rectify the situation is yell and scream at me that he wasn`t doing anything else without more furniture for his other offices. Long to the short I figured out that his custom theme was nothing more than a $2.99 template that you can buy yourself online. I had a guy from YP looking at the site because he was helping with meta tags and advertising it, he told me that their was literally malicious code inside the site that the big search engines will NOT rank. The guy from YP told him that it would be best if he removed it immediately before faced with a lawsuit. I don`t know if he removed it or not because the site was such garbage that I took it down. Someone else on here mentioned that they went to his office and saw that they had moved out and there was no furniture so I guess he got some pretty nice furniture to move into his house. Nonetheless, a fool and their money are soon parted and that`s how I feel now. He takes your money and barter and does NOT care about your business nor knows how to build websites or proper content."<1<11<2019<9<4<40

At the end they just gave me few ice cubes in a new cup so I can put them in my latte which... only makes lukewarm latte? If iced matcha latte wasn`t available I would have ordered something else.

I asked for a combover and it ended up looking real crappy. When the stylist got done cutting and styling his hair, it looked fine. Upon coming home and showering to get excess hair off was a different story. The parts on successful combovers I`ve seen are more to the side, while the stylist shaved it off almost halfway down the middle of my sons head. It pretty much looked like half of my son`s head was shaved/faded completely (practically down the middle, not side part), while the other side had long hair. I tried to style it and put loads of gel on it to make it look bearable, but it was still pretty bad. It just looked so weird! We came back today to get it fixed, and another stylist just said that that`s how it`s supposed to look like and showed my husband photos of hairstyles that were similar to the cut my son had, but cmon, even at first glance you`d be able to see how bad the cut was. Glad that they did try to somehow fix it, and his haircut looks better. Sucks cause we would`ve been regular patrons here seeing as it`s really so close to us. Guess we`ll just have to drive a little extra over to snips & clips when my son needs another haircut.<8<11<2016<4<34<32

There are more exhibits that can rack up the cost even more, such as the penguins and SeaTrek. The SeaTrek is  walking helmet '"dive'" which is $99 a person for an hour tour. The Penguin Encounter is an additional $49.95 per person! These are in addition to the cost of admission of $42.95 per person (adult) So you can really drop some serious money for a few hours in a pretty small aquarium! The most exciting exhibit was the restroom, haha! The view of sharks, and fish, swimming around while you wash up, was pretty cool!  We went for the '"monster fish,'" exhibit. Or should I say tiny fish, with information on how big they can get, and a few models of '"monster fish.'"  It was our second time at this aquarium, and I was extremely disappointed again! It`s really a lot of money to get in, and you can littering go through it, in about an hour, and that`s taking your time at each exhibit!  Not for me.  Tips... look for coupons!

And when you call them out, they`re not the slightest bit concerned, just on to the next. I look forward to the manager`s response to this. It`ll be more of what I just mentioned. Let me guess...'"miscommunication'", '"Although we strive to make everyone happy...'", '"I`m sorry your experience with us wasn`t as good as you expected...'" Keep `em coming, guys.

Parking can also be a bit of a drag, but I`ve lucked out each time so it hasn`t been too bad. I`ve ordered the snooze classic and the Bella! Bella! Benny. The eggs are cooked perfectly, bacon is tasty. If you come to snooze you have to order the pancakes. I order a regular old pancake...they are anything but regular. Pancakes at snooze are yummy. My friend ordered the pancake flight, pineapple upside down, sweet potato, and pancake of the day which was Smores. I always order the cold brew, it is so delicious. I`ve ordered cold brew from other restaraunts and get annoyed because it does not taste like Snooze`s cold brew.

I am honestly a bit shocked this place is still even open for business. The shakes are wildly inconsistent, taste/texture as well as price. The young male employees need some customer service coaching. Yesterday there was food sitting on the counter in Styrofoam containers on the counter where you approach to order your shake. They were engaged in a personal conversation, that is not meant to be had in front of paying customers. They did not take a pause from this conversation after I walked in to ask how they could help me. I stared blankly at them both until I was then asked what I would like. The conversation continued whilst making my shake, which only delayed it and left me sitting there agitated. There are cameras in the store, but no adults in site. This is not the first time either, the boys are sweet I`m sure, but not a good look on the business when this is the third time I have been in there and each time I was not greeted, my shakes have all tasted different ( I have ordered the same one each time), and their personal conversations take precedent over the paying customers in their store.<24<7<2019<20<12<51

If it was a review of manager/receptionist experience it would be zero stars - horrible.  The salon itself is a convenient location and appears to be clean and very busy.  So first the good stuff - Just recently started coming here after having Stella do a wash/cut/style for a wedding I attended in September - Stella is AMAZING.  Hands down one of the best hair cuts I have had in past 20 years.  If you have naturally curly hair, Stella KNOWS what to do. Just went back to request Stella for a color and, again, amazing results.  She made a great recommendation and I have had nothing but rave reviews of my new color and cut.  I would follow Stella anywhwere - her talent and experience are an awesome combination.  Now - disappointing part....this place is expensive.  It is an Aveda salon, so yeah, I get it - it is not a budget barber..  And yeah, got to pay a little more to get quality - I get that, too.  But if I am going to drop $150++ on ANY kind of service, I expect to have 2 minutes undivided attention of the receiptionist/cashier person and at minimum a '"thank you'" as I am paying.  My stylist, Stella, is warm and incredibly appreciative.  But when you walk in, the older blonde woman sitting in a chair chatting on the phone behind the front counter, does not even bother to greet customers.  (I think her name is Karen and I think she is - and this is the horrifying part - maybe the manager?) Another stylist has greeted me both times upon my arrival for my appointments.  When you are finished ready to pay -you have to pay the older blonde woman - and she does not even bother to get off the phone and provide an ounce of customer service.  It is quite disgusting.  BOTH vistis, once my service was complete and my styist brought me up to the front counter to check out, I stood at the counter for several minutes listening to her chit-chat on what was obviously a personal phone call - she never put the phone down and barely addressed me other than to say the amount I owed and hold out her hand for my payment.  She runs my card and practically YANKS the machine for me to put my PIN # in back out of my hand, rips off the receipt and without even looking at me, nor putting the phone down, holds the receipt for me to take.  If she is the owner, shame on her for not appreciating customers.  If she is just an employee or manager - the owner needs to instruct her to put the phone down when she has a PAYING CUSTOMER standing in front of her and perhaps teach her a little bit about customer service and reminding her that the first and last impressions can influence whether a customer comes back.  If it was not for Stella`s amazing talent and warmth as a stylist, I would go elsewhere. Being treated rudely by the cashier is inexcusable in a city the size of Charlotte with a slew of salon options - including other Aveda salons."<20<11<2016<19<57<55

Within an hour the new mattress was delivered (free) and our old one hauled away - talk about exceptional customer service! Very satisfied and will be back next time we are in need.<18<5<2014<23<44<56

vZaRf8pDV_N2UE9kyx2Ynw<ECHloz8m5AwCTAT5wVBuQg<eWBpKALvjhYl5iacH9iRWA<5<1<0<0<This spa is the first thing you see when you get off on the 8th Fl of WA where the gym and pool are also located, so be ready to be tempted because that`s what happened to us. My SO and I went in and made an appointment for the next morning sort of impulsively, but couldn`t have been happier!   I am mainly so impressed with the facility. There`s a pool, waterfall shower, regular shower, two separate wait rooms (one co-ed, the other separated), steam rooms, and two other seating areas with heated seats. I recommend going early or staying later to truly take advantage of the facility.   The massage was also great esp for the price ($360/couple). Every massage is customized for your needs, so take advantage of that and tell them your expectations! I should`ve gotten her name, but I didn`t get my masseuse`s name, but she was very professional. She told me beforehand why she was applying specific type of oil, made sure that I was okay with it. She also spent a lot of time in my problem areas as promised which I really appreciate given that the massage was only supposed to last an hour (60 min). I felt so great and I miss it already!  One thing to note that I saw other people noted is that the water pressure is a bit disappointing. I`m not sure why they won`t turn the waterfall shower into a real shower and put things like shampoo, conditioner, etc there, but it`s an empty shower booth.<24<6<2019<1<23<30

Food: 4/5: The agnolotti, the filet, Italian fries, and sausage pizza were all good. However, the price you pay I expect one thing to be great and it was all a bit underwhelming.    Ambience: 3/5: I didn`t really enjoy the style or the music, but I can imagine some people would.  Service: 4/5: everyone was doing their job, but again nothing was exceptional   Price: 3/5: This is a pricer spot which is fine, but then my expectations are higher.

I ordered a French onion soup and a medium rare filet mignon which was cooked perfectly. I enjoyed the meal and had no issues with the food but was let down by dessert which is the part I was most excited about.   The desserts were just simply not good... at all. I had a crème brûlée and profiteroles... both were equally bad. Crème brûlée is such a classic French dessert and I honestly don`t know how they could have messed it up so badly, so that was pretty disappointing.  I would recommend the restaurant if you are looking for a classic French meal in a nicely decorated old style building, but please skip the dessert!<20<8<2018<1<32<42

I`ve been here probably 5 times, and I`m amazed every single visit.  They don`t have the widest selection, but each and every single item is prepared so well.  The most memorable item that I`ve had here is definitely the Mac and Cheese (I know, such a simple item to judge a buffet on but it`s absolutely incredible).  Other ones I can remember are the Sea Salt Crusted Prime Rib and Crab Legs.  I like how everything is laid out and prepared for you so it`s minimal work from plate to mouth!  Service is great and the decor / ambience is unmatched.  The Buffet at Wynn is 100% a must try if you haven`t already been, and a must-repeat if you have.  Can`t wait for my next visit here (which will be next month!)  A quick story: My girlfriend`s brother took an Uber to Caesar`s Palace to try Bacchanal Buffet and on the way there, the driver (a Vegas local of 15+ years) said that Wynn Buffet is actually the best buffet in Vegas.

You might want to reconsider you`re extremely illogical rule of locking the doors to the gate 10 minutes before take off.   When YOU are at fault because of connecting flights running late, you end up spending hundreds and probably thousands for hotels and vouchers to angry customers because of your stupid protocol.   After my flight was delayed twice, I broke the wheels on my suit case running to make my connecting flight... which was still there when I arrived.... but the ONLY thing between me making it to see my boyfriend tonight who`s in the military and I wont have much more time to see.... WAS A FUCKING RULE.   About 5 years ago, my friends mom found out her brother was on his death bed, booked the first flight out on American, raced to the airport, ran to the gate, and SAW IT CLOSING.... and because of that  stupid fucking rule she didn`t make it on the plane to see her brother before he died.   The world is changing and I hope your company goes under because of the bullshit you put people through for no logical reason.   Your employee told me '"Well they have to close it 10 minutes before'".   No. You fucking don`t.   Thanks for the free fucking room and $12 meal voucher.

I have never had this be an issue as I`ve used my debit card in at least 10 previous rentals without issue.

Jeff bought me breakfast and it was no special occasion. Cool huh!  We had gone fishing earlier and he lost a huge bass and I did too. Good thing we don`t have to depend on our fishing or hunting prowess for food like some people. We would probably starve. Anyway, back to the diner. We had built up a pretty good appetite and were looking for a good breakfast spot. Black Bear Diner came to mind from previous Yelp reviews. I chose the country fried steak and eggs, Jeff chose the thick sliced smoked bacon and eggs. Both breakfasts were ok but definitely not worth the $9.00 apiece price tag. The drinks and breakfast came out in less than 5 min. You read right, 5 MIN. So quick in fact, it made me suspicious and cautious. Everything was warm and APPEARED freshly made but the speed at which they came out pointed to pre-made, nuked or heat lamped. Probably left over from the early morning crowd and not being regulars we were given the left overs. We arrived about 9am.  At least Waffle House is cooked to order!  If you are not going to serve a freshly made product, then the price should reflect that and inform the customer! Boy, that would be a first. The waitress would say, '"Excuse me, we made too much hash browns, chicken fried steak and biscuits this morning. Would you like a 50% discount on your meal or would you prefer freshly made at full price?'" I would choose the former in a heart beat! So essentially my son paid a total of $22.00 + tip for left overs. My son works very hard for his money and to take his money using deceptive practices really pisses me off! I recouped some of the price by using all the butter and jelly on the dry baseball sized thing they call a biscuit! I am so pissed off right now I am taking away another star. No..make that 2 stars. LOSERS! I can`t believe I told the waitress thank you... Makes me gag. It`s no wonder fast food places flourish."<8<6<2012<20<58<47

Upon entering, we were immediately greeted by a staff and seated (it`s a small place, so reservations are recommended). The place was decorated with modern elements, but not in a stark manner.  Upon perusing through the menu, we decided to share: Okonomi '"bulgogi'", Holy Crab!, Truffle Aburi Chirashi, Spider Bao. I also ordered the Lychee Reisling Sangria and my friend Yuzu Toronto.   The portions were healthy and fed the 3 of us generously!   Okonomi '"bulgogi'" - it`s interesting that the pancake was separately cooked from the bulgogi, then assembled sandwich style, which I am happy about because the flavours of each were blended better.  Holy Crab! - if I ever come to eat here alone, this would be my #1 order. The soft shell crab was generous in size, crispy and lightly seasoned along with the fried rice, was delicious!  Truffle Aburi Chirashi - my least favourite from this visit, I felt like it was trying to be so many things and my mouth didn`t appreciate it. It probably also didn`t help that this was the last to arrive from all our orders.   Spider Bao - soft shell crab goodness! If it`s in the menu, I will almost always order it and this bao did not disappoint. I don`t think it needed the guac though, otherwise this is definitely a fave. The bao was so soft and airy, just the right vessel to carry the crab.   Lychee Riesling Sangria - I will admit that when it comes to sangrias, I`m a bit of a snob - probably because I know what a good version should taste like. To enjoy this drink, wait for the flavours to meld together for about 5 minutes before drinking it, that way the lychee flavour will marry with the riesling better.   Overall, I enjoyed the food here and will plan to visit often!"<13<7<2018<18<29<5

We headed to the desk, picked up our tickets and proceeded to the VIP line at the venue. We were seated fairly quickly and the boys were already vamping with the audience.   Brendan and Scott were hilarious. They are parodying all 7 Harry Potter books. You don`t need to '"know'" the books, but hubby has only seen the movies so some of the jokes were lost on him. These two actors did a fantastic job of connecting with the audience and keeping their energy for the entire 70 minutes. I was actually a little bummed when I realized it was over.   They do a meet & greet after the show, but we had to get back across town to Summerlin so we had to book out of there. I would absolutely say this show is worth the time! It`s very clever and perfect for any Harry Potter fan!"<13<12<2019<7<4<45
xB89af1cg-yawicv509--g<NLEVoVOykAD2-uEdsqNI7A<y21M2pMkc0csUh0mQv7SUA<1<3<0<0<My Home Warranty originally sent out Alchemist Pool Service to fix my pool pump and the service was bad. They stopped by, looked at my pool pump and said the motor needed to be replaced. They then collected the $75 and said they`ll report back to Home Warranty and be back in a couple of days. I got a call from my Home Warranty the next day and they said Alchemist Pool service reported back that the pool pump motor looked like it had been inoperable for the last 6 months, and that it wouldn`t have passed any inspection so my Home Warranty denied my claim. That was completely false information as my pump had just stopped working and any pool expert would be able to clearly identify that just by looking at the quality of the water. My pool was crystal clear! I also had a pool inspection report from the month prior that I sent to Alchemist as proof that it was working and they never responded. I asked Home Warranty for a second opinion and the sent out SoClean LLC and they were amazing. They diagnosed the problem and fixed it within an hour! I definitely won`t be using Alchemist in the future.<29<6<2018<18<58<46

The menu looked great but didn`t seem to have a lot of patrons inside. At this point, and tired to looking for another place to eat, we settled on Nomads, and I am glad we did. My friends had the traditional breakfast of eggs, toast and sausages but I decided to try their breakfast burrito which was delicious and very filling. They have a house made avo sour cream as well as a hot sauce that goes really well with the burrito, but you`ll have to ask for it as it doesn`t come with the burrito. The server was fantastic and attentive without being overbearing and someone came out from the kitchen to actually check in personally to see how we enjoyed the food (wow). I hope this location stays but also hope that the great services stays as that seems to get lost as places become popular.  I would definitely come back again to try the other things on the brunch as well as the regular menu. The only reason why they didn`t get the full 5 star because the burrito could use for a bit more chorizo and even distribution of that delicious sauce which I only discoverers at the end of the burrito, but that said it was still delicious and didn`t stop me from clearing the plate. The restaurant space itself is nice, clean and big so you wouldn`t feel like you are eating on top of other customers.  I would have given this a 4.5 but I can`t figure out how to do half rankings.<15<9<2019<22<37<3

Went here as a spur of the moment kind of thing while running around doing errands. We ordered the beef tacos and beef tater tots. Food came out pretty quick. Let`s just say it was delicious! The fusion of the Korean and Mexican ingredients worked so well together. We also BOUGHT their very own hot sauce they make. $4 for a pound of savory goodness. Not bad! (I bought 2). Water was refilled very frequently by the owner I`m assuming, and our server (don`t know her name) was very friendly as well. Next time will probably order ahead and order take out.<3<10<2019<3<14<25

F12BDFgbZZl4ICJAWjJAYg<0xRAAStEi_dBFLD-1xSMHQ<T4g4k2OhCTsiqcP-ZXElHQ<5<1<1<2<OK, about time for this review!  This Jules Bistro is a near Michelin star restaurant with food that will tickle your tastebuds, send you back to a nostalgic Paris, and will impress you with their Ritz Carlton-like customer service.  Food: Let`s start with their appetizers. Go for the octopus, even if you`ve never tried. It is cooked to perfection and is buttery good. Try the scallops if you love seafood, they are melt-in-your-mouth-like-milk-chocolate good. For the main, we almost always order the Steak Frites (if you don`t like ratatouille, ask for more fries. They have a dedicated fryer for the fries, that`s why they taste so addictive!). Nom, nom, nom...  Drinks: perfect for a dinner date or group of 6-7. There`s also seating at the bar for maybe 6. Moderate selection of beer, wines, but you come here more for the food.  Vibe: casual, but not too casual. French but more Canadian. Pro tip: there`s a small front patio but you`ll need to go early to snag a seat. No live music so talk to your date or friends!  Location: South of Queen and Spadina, next door is Fresh, Fusaro`s. It`s on 2 streetcar lines and a cycle lane (Adelaide) so even more convenient for urbanites. Street parking only though for cars.  Go for a special occasion or the weekly special dinner, it`s about $30-50 pp if you factor in a main, appetizer, and drink, plus tax and tip.  Ask for Philip and say Justin and Will recommended your restaurant. -A must eat in downtown Toronto!<28<8<2018<19<5<49

Spectrum truly spoiled the awardees and guests as everything was all-expense-paid including: round-trip airfare, all meals, open bar, gratuities for all hotel personnel, luggage handlers, ground transportation, activities, and other service personnel for the events included in this program. Also, all Superstars received a $250 American Express debit card for any extraneous expenses, so we literally just solely focused on fun and relaxation during our stay here.  Located in the high Sonoran Desert on an expanse of rugged Arizona landscape where the ancient vistas, mountains and roaming wild horses remain untouched, the resort was designed to be an authentic representation of the Gila River Indian heritage and culture. The architecture, design, art and legends of the Akimel O`otham and Pee Posh tribes are celebrated in every detail imaginable, indoors and out. The walking trails are simply beautiful and the landscaping is adorned with Palo Verde trees and Saguaros. This peaceful resort is very secluded and you will not see any remnants of your typical urban jungle for miles.  All hotel staff were very accommodating and the only problem we encountered was the iron in our room stained my husband`s business meeting attire. Despite making two calls to guest services for bringing a replacement, there was no attempt made. I was going to deduct a star for that, but after completing a survey, customer service made it right by giving us 5000 Starwood Preferred Guest Points.  NOTES + Since this resort is secluded, you will have to find alternate transportation to venture off the premises. There is a free shuttle service that will take you to and from the Phoenix Premium Outlets, Wild Horse Pass & Casino, and Aji Spa & Salon. Speak to Guest Services regarding shuttle schedule and routes.  + We opted to enroll in the Make a Green Choice (MAGC) program where we omitted housekeeping. Additional towels and toiletries are available upon request, if needed. As a perk, you can choose from a $5 Food and Beverage Credit or 500 SPG Starpoints per day where you can redeem at several restaurants, room service, gift shop, bar, and a Starbucks on-site.  + Download the AttendeeHub app to get real time notifications of events so you don`t miss out.<31<3<2018<22<19<8

We`re in Las Vegas and why DO you want to eat Japanese food out in Chinatown? (While going into a mini-tirade about questioning my usual adventurous food palate) ME:  Oh, hahaha....it`s NOT Japanese restaurant AND YOU missed hearing '"Gastro Tapas'".... it`s a SPANISH restaurant!   Ah, so much for your '"selective hearing'"!  We used an Uber dive to and from our hotel to this restaurant out to what seems to be the very edge of Chinatown.  I think if you`re not familiar with this area, it`s better to do so plus, even though there is a huge shared parking lot at this strip mall, it was really buzzing for a Thursday night as evidenced by the numerous cars circling around like vultures looking for a dead body.    We entered this small and cozy Spanish restaurant and was personally greeted by Award winning Chef Oscar Amador-Edo.  As he heartily welcomed us with warmth and sparkling smile, he guided us to our reserved table.  As soon as he left us, a bus person quickly  came by to offer us water (bottled, sparkling or tap) and our server, Caroline, popped up by asking us if we had any questions about the menu.  The menu is somewhat limited but what caught my eyes was their Dégustation Menu which features TEN (10) Tapas Tasting for only $45pp!  Well, that took the stress out of decision making and so that`s what we ordered along with a pitcher of their red wine Sangría.    Our place setting was interesting with its '"tweezer'" eating utensil which was then supplemented with more eating utensils.  I`m afraid to describe the 10 tapas that were delivered '"hot and furious'" to our tiny table as my words are too rudimentary.  -Gazpacho:  cantaloupe-based, this chilled fruit soup prepared our taste buds for what was to come. -Oysters Barcelona:  braised melon, lemon and mint over fresh raw oysters -Fermented Tomato Salad:  in-house fermented tomatoes, burrata sphere and basil '"air'" -Tostada:  tuna rillette, guacamole and aji rocoto (rocoto chili pepper) -Montadito;  smoked salmon crostini, truffled cream cheese and honey - served under smoke infused dome -Bikini: sobrasada, Mahón cheese in pressed brioche -Croquetas:  kimchi pisto, romesco sauce -Albóndigas: Ibérico pork meat balls, mushroom sauce -Huevos Estrellados:  olive oil fried eggs, crispy potatoes, piquillo peppers -Kurobuta Pork Cheek:  pork cheek confit, red curry, roasted white wine potatoes -Granita:  strawberry shaved ice, popcorn mousse  You`d have to try this Spanish GEM out in Chinatown to get the full experience.  EDO Tapas & Wine killed it...their ambiance, service, culinary creativity, flavors and value were top notch!    We`d return in a heartbeat but don`t forget to make reservations because I think the secret is out.  I asked if the restaurant was named after Cataluyan Chef Oscar Amador-Edo and our server replied affirmatively BUT also said it`s a '"play'" on his last name.  She said that EDO means '"extra day off'" in the hospitality industry."<2<3<2019<9<9<51

NDSFrcjMojghY45ndqlhsA<kEGe1IU04nRh8b7oFDer-A<WA7sC64kCRstywm2EgZXEw<2<2<0<0<I visited this restaurant a number of times when it was under old management (called Anatoli) and again yesterday under the new management (called Pasha`s).   Under the old management, the food was really good, but the service was really slow and bad. The staff didn`t understand English and it was difficult for them to get the order right. Usually they forgot stuff or didn`t bring it at all.  Under the new management, the staff are all the same, so English is still a problem.  The menu has been redone and all the descriptions have been removed, so now it`s just Turkish names without any English meanings. Having to speak to the waiter to have him explain everything was quite an ordeal.  Unfortunately, the service is still really slow. The food is quite good - it`s the same as the previous restaurant, but new management has also increased the prices and (I think) reduced the portion sizes. So you`re paying $6.50 for a tiny cup of soup now. I was surprised.  If you`re ok with paying a bit more and know what you want, then the food is good. I would recommend the Kanefe(?) dessert. It is very yummy.  The reason for 2 stars? While the food is good, it just isn`t worth the bad service and the price.<2<7<2015<20<22<4

And it did!  Surprisingly, this hidden brew gem is tucked off a residential street close to ASU. Having patronized them for years,  we almost feel a part history of  their success.  Case in point, we went there before:  it branched out to new locations,  marketed and bottled their signature beers, before its gift shop, and before their buy out by Anheuser Busch. We keep coming back because of all the right reasons that make this stand out from the house brews, seasonal beers, great food and the casual vibe atmosphere.  Establishing the trend to have a unique brewery and also having delicious bar food took it to a new level. They also have a separate menu special for lunch, dinner and brunch. I heard and havent booked that during the year,  they have a chef special prepared prefixe dinner of unusual and exotic foods which I heard is outstanding.  We love having their seasonal or specialty brews, Pumpkin Porter, Odelay and ordering up our faves, either their juicy hamburgers, lightly beer battered chicken tenders or fish fries.  Only thing Im not a big fan of is their steak fries. I prefer them shoe string or regular cut, and so I sub out for another side instead. They also recently started a Bloody Mary and Minosa bar but noticing that their brews and food are still the main attraction. Its usually a wait on weekends and parking can be hard to find but if you are not starving or super thirsty,  its worth the wait.<8<10<2019<19<35<39

We were renting out our house in Gilbert and moving up to a rental in Scottsdale for the short-term.  Both Robert and RJ were terrible at getting back to us on requests. Not even difficult requests - simple ones like nailing down how we are getting our rental income checks, confirming that our tenant signed their lease before we signed our own rental lease, getting a copy of the rental lease for our house, confirming whether or not we were going to see our own rental options, etc.  It would take 4-5 days and a follow-up email for Robert to respond back to me.   Fast forward to when we were getting the keys. RJ texts us the night before asking if 8 am was okay for the walk-through... on a Thursday.  No, it`s not - we both work and we told him this. So my husband agrees to meet at 7 am before his day starts and RJ agreed. What happens?  RJ shows up 30 minutes late. Come on RJ! You can`t show up on time? Plus, the lockbox was on a timer so he couldn`t even get into it and had to call the other property manager.  Not only that but then he starts pressuring hubs to do the full walk-through when he had a full car to unload. No RJ, that`ll have to get done later because YOU were 30 minutes late. There was a reason we couldn`t meet at 8 am because we have jobs that require us there by that time.  You can`t show up 30 minutes late and then expect us to have time to get through what YOU want to get through. He also decided to drop a bomb saying '"you`re going to be here tomorrow morning, right?'" and then hubs had to take 5 minutes to get it out of him that a contractor was going to be by to fix something.  RJ - seriously? I finally just emailed the other property manager and asked to be the first contact on anything related to the house.  Guess what happened after I contacted the property manager?  We discovered RJ didn`t tell us about multiple issues with the house. First, there was a contractor scheduled to install blinds in the house and second, we have no mailbox key.  No fault to the new owners of our rental house but the old owner took off with the mailbox key and never told the new owners which mailbox number was ours. RJ knew ALL of this and never told us. Don`t you think we would find out we couldn`t check the mail?  One month into our lease with the tenant, we get a short laundry list of items.  No big deal -- always happens, right? We give Robert the thumbs up to get bids on the work, ask him to contact the HOA regarding one of the items and to get back to us.  One month after we asked for bids, and heard nothing back, I had to follow up. One item had been taken care of and the other ones were radio silence. We own another house in MD and man, we are so fortunate our property managers for that house are so diligent and keep open communication.  In April, our air conditioning unit was on the fritz.  Did I receive notification from Robert about this before he called our home warranty company?  No. He never reached out to us to let us know there was something wrong or that he was putting in a work order to the warranty company.  I only found out our A/C unit needed to be replaced because the home warranty company called me directly to go over our options. Completely unacceptable.  Our property management company for our other investment house would never keep that type of repair undisclosed.   In May, Robert told me about some issues with our back wall and a palm tree in our backyard, so I had asked him to obtain quotes to divert the palm tree roots and also costs to remove the tree.  We never heard from him again for these quotes, even after a follow-up.  In July, we informed Robert our intentions to sell the house.  Obviously, we`re not insane and we had hired a new realtor to sell our house but as the current property manager, he was supposed to inform our tenant before our new realtor contacted him to schedule everything.  Robert never told our tenant. So our realtor calls the tenant to try and schedule the photos and our tenant is taken completely off guard. Our tenant reached out to Robert and specifically asked him if he knew.  You want to know the response? Robert actually had the audacity to tell him '"oh yeah, I meant to tell you'". Well, thanks a lot because now our tenant is completely defensive in us trying to get the house on the market and is being a huge pain.  I can`t really blame the tenant because he got a call from a stranger telling him we were selling the house. This should have come from Robert.  In July and August, our tenant ended up contacting our realtor for the majority of things - things such as trying to terminate his lease agreement earlier.  Our realtor had to tell our tenant that he wasn`t responsible for that and all of that type of correspondence had to be sent to Robert.  Our tenant actually said that he preferred to contact our realtor than Robert since the realtor was more responsive."<16<10<2018<23<2<57

Chris was accommodating and spent two hours explaining all the features in the car and all the option I had regarding purchasing and leasing the vehicle. I never thought I could lease a car as I drive a lot (around 30k per year) but Chris gave me an option for leasing that I couldn`t say no to you. The value I got for my trade in car was also more than my expectation. Diblib also was very helpful taking me through the credit application form and explaining all the extras without really pressuring me into anything. After the purchase, I couldn`t wait until the delivery date and kept texting and calling Diblib and Chris to get more info on my credit approval status and the vehicle delivery status, etc. They were both very patient and responded to my calls and texts promptly. Finally, I had a pleasure of working with Yalda on the delivery and again like everyone else at Parkway Honda she patiently guided me through all the paper works answered all my questions and even spent some time explaining all the features on the vehicle even though Chris had already done that during the test drive. Chris aIso called me a day after my purchase following up to see if I had any questions and emailed me a link to some video instructions on how to use the many features of my new Pilot. I would definitely recommend Parkway Honda to everyone who is in the market looking for a new vehicle.<18<11<2017<22<40<16

While you are in the tank it feels like a cross between floating in outer space and a deep peaceful meditation.  When you get out of the tank your body feels ultra relaxed (similiar to the feeling you have after a massage) and your senses are heightened due to being isolated.

The decor in the restaurant is very modern and also has a nice loungey feel to it. I was promptly seated and the service was so attentive, friendly and engaging. Kudos to their efforts made to make a great first impression during their grand opening!  I tried two entrees: their Pad See Ew and Malaysian Curry with beef. The Pad See Ew was the better dish of the two for me. It was full of flavour and the rice noodle was super wide and flat! The curry was delicious too however I think the beef was a bit overcooked as it was tough to chew.  I couldn`t leave without trying their Mango Sticky Rice and I was not disappointed. The rice was nice and chewy and the mangos were thinly cut (and beautifully presented)!   The pricing is definitely a little higher and portions were just a bit short for me but overall I had a really great experience. The staff (and owners) are currently very engaging and receptive to feedback, the food is well plated and taste great. I will definitely be back!<28<9<2019<5<13<14

I was told '"Pay $150 and get 3 nights in Vegas and you get a free a 5 day cruise.'"  You also get two 75 dollar gift cards for dining.'"  The only catch was that I had to listen to their sales pitch in return. Sweet! I paid the $150. Got $150 back in gift cards, so I`m actually ahead of the game!!   The room was nice and we went to our presentation.  The only issue was that we had to wait a half an hour for our '"scheduled'" appointment.  This just added to the time for our presentation and ate into our personal time.  During the presentation we toured the pool.  It was murky, turbid water with way too many people in it, to the point of absurdity.  I would not even consider dipping my toes in.  We went outside to get the view on the patio of the airport and planes taking off and landing which was the theme throughout the resort.    Once we did not buy, we were given the most worthless '"free'" cruise and worthless buy one get one free gift cards I have ever seen.  The food can only be used at participating restaurants that are way off the beaten path.  Good luck if you don`t have a rental car.  None of them were a good deal.  We were shocked at how worthless the cards they '"gave'" us were.  They ended up in the garbage!  None of the restaurants were enticing and none ended up being a good deal, a total rip off!  You could do better going to a buffet!!!  The cruise was equally worthless.  By the time you paid all of the fees, the trip would end up costing more than if you booked it online.  Also, you would never be able to book it if you wanted to because you had to pay up front with no guarantee of any open slots to book it.  Horribly worthless gifts for a rip off vacation!

No communication between staff, everyone looks apathetic. I hit the bar to pass time, never get greeted, the bartender was completely aloof walking in circles doing side work as I`m leaning in trying to order a round of drinks. So I have to ask her if I can order once she passes right past me. The beers weren`t very cold, cocktail too sweet.

It`s kind of sad because I wanted to love Smashburger. It`s conveniently located near my house, and the promise of the restaurant was great, but the execution didn`t meet my expectations.  The first time I went there was a couple of months ago. I created my own 1/3 pound burger with bacon, pepper jack cheese, spicy chipotle bun, spicy chipotle sauce, and some jalapenos. It bought the heat! It was extremely spicy, but man, it was so delicious. It really hit the spot after seeing a movie across the street at village square. Their smashfries were delicious too; they were smothered in oil, rosemary, and garlic for a crisp and tasty bite.   I came back a couple days ago, and I wanted to try something new, so I ordered  the barbecue ranch smashchicken, and I hated it. Why would I spend $6 on this burger, when I could have gotten either some spicy chicken sandwiches from mcdonalds, or one of arby`s chicken sandwiches for far less money for the same ingredients and quality. It was so plain and mediocre. The lettuce and tomato did nothing for the sandwich, and the person that made it put so much sauce on it that it was over powering the rest of the flavors and dripping out of the bun. Needless to say, I wasn`t pleased.  My advice for you, if you want to try smashburger, is to stick with a burger. The chicken is plain, and you can get the same thing from other fast food restaurants for cheaper prices.<3<12<2010<18<50<0

If they try to send you to Adult 5 level DO NOT GO!!! There is NO HELP, staff does bare minimal and just '"goes through the motion'" and does not address any issues patients have and just hand you medication as the answer. The nurses tried to give me medication and when I refused they tried to tell me it was prescribed by the dr., who I had never met! Let alone it was a highly addictive medication and no one had explained to me why I was being prescribed to take it. And to add to horror a fight broke out between two patients in the first 5 min I was there and staff did nothing to resolve it besides putting one person in the '"non-padded room'" without addressing why the two were in conflict. Making it the nurses entertainment for the night. Not wanting to give up hope and get help I asked to be discharged or to move to another unit. The next day I was moved to detox unit, where the only thing that was consistent were the 6am vital checks, snack breaks and smoke breaks. There were hardly any interactions with the nurses and doctors with the patients. On the board the nurses write a full day filled with group therapy, meals, activities, etc., and the only thing that was really offered were the meals. After being there for two days I felt worse than when I had gone in. So by the third day to save my sanity and what little hope I had left, I DEMANDED to be discharged. To add insult to injury when I got the medical bill for 5,000 for three days in hell it made me sick to my stomach.

The reason I initially chose this place is there are not many dentists that take my insurance.

They were however, a clean facility and the dentist and everyone else was professional so I figured I`d proceed. They let me know what needed to be done and said I would go to the Rainbow location as well as being able to make a payment plan for the remainder of the treatment.  They picked me up which I thought was a nice service. I got there and the office manager stated there would be no payment arrangements for the copay. She also asked me why I took a ride if I wasn`t prepared for the copay. I heard everything I needed to hear at this point. I decided I would not continue with the advised plan.

I feel like the price listings here that mark the MGM as more reasonable than other strip-located hotels are here because of the West Wing rooms-- that may be so, but they are small pods with no real windows. The hotel caters to people who want to be '"on the strip'" in a famous-name hotel but aren`t going to stay in their rooms.   There are quirks that go along with a hotel that is clearly showing its age-- the phone system failed our first night, so a broken safe in our room couldn`t be fixed. Fortunately the front desk was helpful enough to upgrade us to the Grand Tower, which is the only part of this hotel that conforms to the standards one would expect for the prices.   Basically, my experience here is that it`s yet another Vegas hotel on the strip that gives you little while charging a lot. Unless you`re going to spend the money for the Waldorf Astoria or the Aria, I`d find a place off the strip which will be nicer for the same money. You can always take a cab to the strip.  Vegas attracts extremely helpful and responsive staff, and the MGM Grand is no exception. But the problems in the hotel are out of their control. All they can do is make it a bit better.  Another thing: if you like having your own food and drinks in the room fridge or enjoy waking up to the hotel room coffee, that`s not an option here. You can`t use the minibar fridge, and you must rent a fridge for $35/day from housekeeping if you need one. There is no in-room coffee maker.

This place took my personal papers from me and used them for their own and would not return mine. That`s called laziness. Do your job. I didn`t bring papers in for them. Those were my papers. Than I ask for them back and am completely dismissed.  What is this? This isnt how business is ran. I complained.  Nothing. The desk lady left. Everybody else got mind blank. I actually saw the paper on the desk and said that one right there is mine. '"Oh we need that.'"

CGLaCxItqmz2eHVazrtHuA<ZBL7OtBuk6PXmyUuhMfGEQ<u2zErKsDuMjV-wqraAcDPQ<1<1<0<0<"I purchased an autographed Mike Trout baseball from here for $199. Before I purchased it I spoke to the vendor Ray Castillo(who lives in San Diego) and told him I wanted to buy the ball but if I send it in to James Spence Authentications(JSA) and the autograph is a forgery will he refund my money. He had no problem with that. So I called Steve at the store and asked him to ring up the purchase for me. He was very helpful. Steve gets the ball,packs it and mails it to me at my home in El Paso,Tx.  I send the ball to JSA and about a week later it comes back as a forged signature. I immediately call Steve and tell him. He said he`ll refund me all of my money plus the extra $14 to ship it back. I tell Steve the seller(Mr.Castillo) should also refund me the money for having the ball authenticated and pay me back for me shipping the ball to JSA and then JSA shipping it back to me, which is a total of $75. The seller refused to do this. Steve asked him to but Mr.Castillo said no and Steve left it at that. I called and texted Mr.Castillo several times, all going unanswered. I would have probably given this store 4 stars until I found out today that the forged Mike Trout autographed baseball was back in Mr.Castillo`s display case(which by the way is 210) and had a price of $199 on it. So that tells me that the Brass Armadillo is okaying the sale of forged autographed items. There are a whole bunch of autographed items in his display case(210) and I`m willing to bet about 80% of them are forgeries. I will admit about two years or so ago I bought an autographed photo from Mr.Castillo and sent it in to JSA and it came back clean. I can`t believe that this store would deceit the public by selling forged autographs which by the way is a federal crime now. I`m an avid sports memorabilia collector and I have been taken a few times by people and that`s my fault but when the Brass Armadillo allows this type of criminal activity to continue knowing that the signature is forged it sickens me. My complaining is not over. I am going to do everything I can to see that Mr.Castillo`s items are removed from the store even if it includes the authorities. Shame on the Brass Armadillo for taking advantage of people by '"stealing'" their hard earned money. You have not heard the last of this!!!!!

We requested a room on the top floor, facing the golf course and they grated our request. It was our 33rd wedding anniversary. The room was quiet and peaceful. We loved looking out and watching the wild bunnies, quail, and the occasional golfer.  The room was very spacious, the bed comfortable, the shower hot and great pressure. It was great having a flat screen tv, a frig, a large coffee pot, microwave, dishes, etc.   The grounds were gorgeous and immaculate! Beautiful trees, flowers and green lawn. The pool was perfect and the restaurant had good food. This place had an open and relaxing feel, and even though it was booked, it was so spacious and spread out, we never felt crowded.  There were only three things that were negative. The carpets needed cleaning, the walls are thin, and the Internet a little slow. Otherwise, we would stay here again because the good outweighed the bad by a long shot!  Here is a link to my video I took of our room:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeEcVOfbvwQ<21<3<2016<17<7<1

However, a friend wanted to meet up there and have breakfast this morning so I decided to give it another try. To my disappointment the 2nd chance experience was just as terrible as my first bad experience if not worse. I don`t feel bad for writing this negative review either because my friend (who suggested the place) was appalled as well by our time there.  If you only have 20-30 minutes to grab a bite to eat then I would recommend this place. Other than that I won`t be coming here again. Try the Orange Table for better food and better service. Upon my arrival I went to the host stand where two girls were present. I requested a table for 2 and the blond RUDELY informed me that they didn`t sit incomplete parties. I have no problem with that, I work at a restaurant with the same policy but the tone of voice of how you tell people is always key and hers was definitely rude. When we finally got sat there was miscommunication between the two girls working and it was clear that the brunette hostess was having a serious problem with her fellow blond coworker. My friend and I shook it off and were simply happy to be sitting at a table with our hopes of breakfast on the way.  The service started out ok, but because we`re servers as well my friend and I were prompt in ordering and made it easy. Food was out quickly which was nice but I wasn`t pleased with the quality as I have been times before. My omelette was extremely oily, which is never something you want especially when you order an eggwhite veggie omelette, and my potatoes were undercooked. The fruit was mostly what I ate. After about 15- 20 minutes of dining our server came over and dropped off the check. My friend and I were both not even half way through our breakfast, forks full with the next bite, and our server Bethany didn`t even offer us anything else while my coffee sat 3/4 empty awaiting a refill (which I finally had to ask someone else for). We were a little put off that she dropped the check so soon and we both felt rushed. After another ten minutes Bethany came back and offered us coffees to go. A nice gesture but the fact that we hadn`t even touched the check and were still eating simply stated that she wanted us gone. We looked around the restaurant wondering if they were waiting on our table for something but noticed that there were 3 or 4 empty table around us and nobody waiting by the host stand so we didn`t think so. Upon checking my watch I noticed that we hadn`t even been there 45 minutes.  We continued to enjoy what we could of our breakfast but at this point we felt so rushed that we sat there til the last second possible before we had to go. This experience fell hand in hand with my last negative experience where I was literally told to leave by the busser after an hour and a half because people were waiting. Like I said I`m a server myself but these people are so eager to turn tables that it simply takes the enjoyment out of going out to breakfast and having a nice meal with a fancy mimosa. If I do go to the Breakfast Club again it will be at there downtown location but that will be no time soon. If you`re in Old Town looking for a good breakfast joint save the rushed feeling that they put on you and enjoy it somewhere else like the Orange Table or Morning Squeeze. Even Daily Dose right down the road have good breakfast! The BC just isn`t worth it any more.<15<5<2014<19<34<38

The first thing I noticed when walking in was how loud the music was, it was to the point where I had to talk almost beside the servers ear as if I was at a night club or an Abercrombie store.   The portions are not worth the amount it costs. I ordered the Shoyu BBQ Pork Ramen, when it came it looked nothing like what it did on the menu and was lacking portions of meat, I then asked the waitress which order was given to me, just in case it could have been a mixed order. The waitress then called another lady which I`m guessing is the manager. She was all super defensive and telling me what I ordered and what it came with. All I wanted to know was if there was a mix up.  The ramen tasted mediocre. There was a heavy taste of MSG in the soup and the noodles were slightly undercooked. Not to mention when the waitress was putting the bowl on my table she dipped her whole thumb in the soup.  When asking for the bill, the waitress threw the card machine on my table and walked away.  I wouldn`t recommend coming to this location.<17<7<2015<3<4<56

The building is nice but the merchandise inside it isn`t.  The book section was of decent size.  The housewares section was picked over and not very tidy.  There was a lot of clothes packed on the racks.  There was some tired looking furniture sitting in the middle of the floor space.  I noticed that I wasn`t the only leaving the store empty handed.

Italian cuisine is one of my favorites so I was so excited when a friend recommended this location on our last visit to Vegas.   First of all, try and get a seat near the large window overlooking the view. I love the bright lights of the strip and this spot in the restaurant is certainly something to behold.   I ordered the Chicken Rigatoni Alla Vodka and it was delicious. The pasta was al dente which I enjoyed, although I understand that some people may not.   I also ordered a glass of Pinot Noir. For an Italian restaurant, I was expecting to see a more extensive wine list but they had the basics so you can definitely find something. If you`re a wino, you might be a little underwhelmed.    My friends ordered other items off of the menu including steak, panzanella, Grandma`s meatballs, calamari, and lasagna. All of us agreed that our meals were delicious.   Atmosphere + quality food + view = a great night out in LV.<10<10<2019<21<16<59

I was flying solo and only ordered flapjacks with bacon. After my waitress took my order she never checked back to see if I had received my food. I actually had to get the attention of another waitress and ask that she check on my order.  Manager eventually brought out my food and wasn`t even apologetic. I had to tell him that I had been waiting over thirty minutes and that I saw two or more tables get their food even though I ordered well before those tables. All he said was '"they lost my order'".  I can understand that an order can get lost, but if my waitress would have been attentive she would have been checking on my food order and would have  prevented this whole issue. The manager gave me a 20% discount but that didn`t help me feel better about my negative experience at this restaurant. I won`t be back."<9<11<2019<14<59<22

I`ve never had an issue with any employee and everyone has always been nice and accommodating.  If there`s ever an issue with my order, which is rare, it`s fixed without any issue and right away.  Even the new employees are doing a great job!  Sometimes you have to be patient, especially when it`s super busy but remember, it`s just coffee!  I do know there`s the occasional snooty and/or rude guest that no one could make happy no matter what you do but that`s life and some people just suck.  Anyone degrading any of these employees obviously has personal issues they aren`t addressing and better not do it while I`m there.

I swear that they made their noodles look mouthwatering. In fact, so mouthwatering that my friend and I went across town to see what it was all about.  The videos and images certainly lived up to the quality of their noodles, the broth and just everything! Maybe it is a good thing they are across town so I won`t spend my money often instead of cook at home. Hahah. I will say that the prices for each items was good for what is given. I imagine this is what legit noodle perfection tastes like as they make it there and you can watch them.  We each got soup. You can choose between 3 cuts of noodles for any dish: thin, flat or knife cut.  We got the spicy pork dumplings and the spice was pure perfection! The soups were perfect! The Tomato & Egg soup`s broth was so good and this dish is perfect for vegetarians. The beef brisket soup was great as well!We also noodled it up a bit more and got the veggie chow mein with knife cut noodles.  Is there a wait? I guess it depends on when you go. We got the last booth when we arrived on a Friday evening. Then there was a wait after us.  Parking? There`s a lot to park for free.

I would give Pfister 0 stars if that were possible.  He saw me for about 5 minutes.  Looked in my eyes, said I had cataracts in both eyes and needed surgery in BOTH eyes  He said I needed Toric lenses to correct for astigmatism, because regular lenses didn`t do that.  He said insurance didn`t cover these lenses but not to worry they had a care credit without interest for 18 months.  He then rushed me out to the secretary making the appointments.  She only gave me information about the Toric lenses because that is how they make their money. I asked her what my level of astigmatism was on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being very bad, and she wouldn`t reply.  Needless to say, I did not make an appointment because I didn`t trust them.  I don`t want someone operating on me that I don`t trust   I called my regular eye doctor to see  what she thought.  She said I didn`t have astigmatism and that Toric lens would do me no good.  In addition, she said I only needed the operation in the left eye because my glasses corrected my vision in my right eye to 20/20.  I told her about my experience at Southwestern Eye Center and she said she had hear this before and won`t refer people to them because of this.    Talk about fraudulent practices--this is it.

Your lychee ice cream was good, but shouldn`t be the only star of the meal.   5 of us girls came here for brunch and I was not amazed. The steak was okay, and sort of salty. The mac and cheese was also okay, but nothing wow. I did like their asian selection - shaumai, shrimp dumpling, porridge with black egg and pork sung - yum.   Something else I enjoyed was their green tea chia seed dessert puree. It was coconuty and had a very refreshing chill and flavor. Another star of the desserts section!   I did have some of their stir fried veggies and green beans as well and those were fresh.   Other than that no honorable mentions. The lobster quiche was horrendous - it tasted like rotten egg with itty bits of lobster. The sushi section looked like below average sushi buffet - so I didn`t even bother. Fried clam meat? Hardly any clam in the batter - all flour.   They had this raw tuna sitting in coconut liquid in the sushi section - not sure what that was supposed to be. The japanesey salad in that section was also disappointing.   Like I said there were more mehs than wows. If you`re sitting with a group and the food isn`t amazing - I don`t care what your place looks like but that`s a shame.

When seeing the parking lot, I cannot get zoolander`s voice out of my head (what is this, a parking lot for ANTS?) but I`ll forgive you Snooze for your tasty food and friendly service. It`s not your fault you are so popular, I guess. I always find street parking a couple blocks down so no worries.  My go-to order has always been pancake flight and the benny duo. Indecisive girl`s heaven. This is perfect amount of food to split between 2 people!   Pancakes are so fluffy and flavorful. My favorite one so far has been the peach cobbler (it was a special- please bring it back!) as well as the sweet potato pancake. My boyfriend`s favorite is the blueberry pancake. Although the pineapple upside down pancake is a crowd favorite, I took a bite of my friend`s and we both thought it was just okay.   My favorite benedict is the Chile Verde benny. The pulled pork with the sauce and runny yolk is delicious. I think I am ready to commit for a full plate instead of doing the benny duo- that`s how good it is!   My friend ordered the Corned Beef Hash and it was also very good! The mimosas are great, and my friend who ordered the bloody mary said it was just OK. I`m not a big fan of bloody marys so pass!  All in all, I love eating at Snooze. I`d love to go on a non-weekend though because these waits can get very long.

Imagine going to the spa, walking into the steam room and just chilling out in a comfy reclinable lounger for about an hour. The only difference is salt is pumped into the room instead of steam. Oh and the walls and floor are made of salt.   Apparently, sitting in the room for an hour is equivalent to hanging at the beach for three days. There are numerous health benefits. My girlfriend was seeking cold relief. I didn`t know what to expect, but found that it was incredibly relaxing. I slept for the majority of  the session. I guess I really needed to recharge.  This a full service spa. We`ll probably come back for massages, in addition to salt therapy. I think that`s what it`s called anyway. I`m so glad my girlfriend is so adventurous. Give it a try.

Standing in the long line there wasn`t much else to do but observe the employees behind the counter. Despite the line, it seemed as if they had a lackadaisical approach.   Lines were long for a few service areas. Lines were long for the self service kiosk. Lines long for package pick up. Lines long at the regular service counter. See a theme? Lol.<22<12<2017<5<45<3

We got half a banana order and no bacon :-(  On the plus side, the whipped cream for the banana was sweet and light.  Yummy.  Wifey ordered the dutch baby, which came out 15 minutes sooner than the rest of our food. I`m not sure if that is customary, but usually all our entrees are brought out to everyone at the same time. She didn`t care much that her pancake had burned sides and a butter pool, but it tasted pretty good to me.   My brother`s cheesy omelet was definitely a wonderment of constipation. He stopped eating his pancakes because he found a curly hair in the stack. I`m not sure, but my sister said that her turkey sausages tasted like beef. Nephew was supposed to have a scrambled egg with his waffle, but sadly, it never arrived.   My eggs were prepared properly as were the sausage links and potatoes, but I was a bit disappointed that the potatoes were soggy and bland, as if they were prepared hours ago or came from the frozen food section. I just prefer crispier taters with some seasoning. I want flava - it`s a restaurant, not a retirement home.   Drinks were refilled at a good pace and I think that our server did the very best she could despite the circumstances. She did explain our situation to the manager (without any prompting from us), who came by the table to adjust the bill and apologize for the inconveniences.   The cashier/hostess area was vacant for about five minutes while a line formed behind me before the store manager walked over to ring up my bill.  I couldn`t help but smile while leaving because the waitress seemed happy about the tip I left on her table.  I believe in maintaining good karma from the foodie gods.<27<9<2010<3<16<5

It was about 12:30ish and the staff was visibly irked with one another in terms of claiming seating territory. (Oops) We were pretty quickly attended to for drinks and then orders, and the food came out pretty quickly as well.  I ordered the Ham and Cheese French Toast sandwich, also known as a Monte Cristo. I have no idea why they don`t call it that; it`s way cooler and my favorite. It came with the eggs on top, so I`m thankful I asked for scrambled, and a side of potatoes. (I`ll have to go back and order this again to get a photo. It was inhaled before I thought about it.) It also came with a tiny cup of maple syrup for dipping, which turned out to be just enough.  Side note for French Toast fans: I don`t know what they did to make their French Toast bread so dessert-like, beyond normal, but it was the best French Toast I`ve ever had. Like, ever. And I`m old.  My Mom`s skillet came with the tortilla literally wrapped around the skillet handle, like the chef might have thought that was fancy. But then the handle gets grabbed by servers and there`s no way she was eating it. Major gross and that knocked this review down one star. Poor decision by the kitchen.   Otherwise,  two thumbs up and I`ll be back...often.  There is plenty of room for power chairs/wheelchairs.<2<12<2019<0<4<54
kGzkxigWLmLFyRdB7fcbkg<Vqo9kfb2zFjJfIF2mXRxlQ<0-pZqYbs2Qwycrjsyvq4hQ<5<2<1<0<I love the Mayo Clinic. This is the kind of healthcare that every American should have. Mayo is a century old non-profit that provides excellent care by some of the best doctors & specialists in the country. The doctors are all on salary so they have no incentive whatsoever to suggest or perform more procedures than you actually need. I love my doctors there.   It would heaven if they did not have to deal with giant insurance companies, which are the polar opposite of this magnificent, deeply humane non-profit.   Insurance companies are all about denying coverage for necessary procedures as often as possible to maximize profits. We`ve entered a Gilded Age 2 with a plutocracy/kleptocracy that thinks CEOs who commit stock fraud are entitled to a severance package worth $1.6 billion. How many people would that kind of money help?   At least a couple of these giant insurance companies are involved in massive & endless litigation against their insureds. It has gotten so bad that insurance companies are arguing with the cream of the crop at the Mayo Clinic about what procedures are or are not medically necessary.    If insurance giants are jerking around a humanitarian citadel like the Mayo Clinic, I shudder to think how they behave towards less prestigious but still great medical institutions & individual insureds? Medicare is better than many expensive insurance policies now.   I haven`t read the Great Gatsby since graduate school, but I think I`ll give it another read.<21<6<2019<6<18<2

My husband had highly recommended it, so I thought I`d give it a try for lunch. We ended up splitting the Halal Guys platter and it was great, and considering we were in Vegas in a strip casino, also super affordable. The meat was flavorful and hot and when we asked for no salad, they happily loaded it up with more rice. They then topped it all off with their famous white sauce and pita bread and it was delicious. I didn`t think we would finish the entire platter because there was quite a lot of food, but we somehow managed! I would definitely recommend Halal`s if you`re at Caesar`s Palace and are looking for a quick, easy, and affordable option for lunch or dinner.<28<11<2019<20<57<38

Definitely a greater selection of dishes and combos in their menu. Everything was pretty good value too, especially compared to other places. We had the fried lobster, and it was sooo good. Super flavourful with the amount of dried fish they put in and fried perfectly. My parents enjoyed this lobster more than the ones the had at Fishman`s. The other dishes we had as part of the combo was pretty good as well. My parents loved the fish soup they served us. The only thing is that the decor and service is a little ...subjective.

Pros:  1) install date was sooner than committed.     2) Product quality is decent - not a premium product as suggested in sales pitch.  Cons: 1) sales pitch is over the top and they try to get you to agree to pricing far higher than they will ultimately accept.   I would advise taking their best price and cut by at least 75% when you are negotiating. 2) after a billing issue, conversations with leadership (company President?) were not pleasant.   Not customer oriented and very unprofessional and defensive.   No accountability for their mistakes. 3) installers were NOT uniformed UWD employees as promised during sales pitch.     4) no paperwork provided on day of installation or anytime immediately thereafter  Overall, I would not recommend doing business.<21<8<2019<17<0<7

nib5YYU1LN9TeFntQF-vXg<NkRVUYzQ9ZKRxTFmucaoqg<xTBhu4RsILyo82lVPBMG8A<1<0<0<0<This is from my wife...  Dear Taco Bell, tonight I tried to call you about a problem with my dinner. I called twice and let it ring but for whatever reason no one there picked up the phone. I wanted to quietly discuss this with the manager. Since you didn`t care that my food went into the trash tonight rather than into my tummy...here goes:  I ordered a Mexican Pizza with no meat at all. Yes, the older gray haired gentleman with the note...that was my husband. He wanted to be sure  that you didn`t mess up my order AGAIN...I have eaten your food at least six times in the past two weeks...only twice was the food good. The other times you either messed it up or the food was just lousy.  So back to my pizza...the note said: Mexican pizza no beef add guacamole on top  What I got was a very costly tostada...there was no pizza sauce...no cheese...no guacamole...and only beans. Beans...$4 + for beans...too many beans. And tostadas have lettuce, tomatoes and cheese for a buck. I just got the crispy tortilla filled with beans. Beans.  I counted and with the rest of my order there should have been 5 containers of guacamole plus another on top of the pizza. So since it only had beans I had to use the red sauce and use one of the guacs from another item to top the pizza...oh and I had to add my own cheese. The pizza on top did have a couple of tiny pieces of some tomato that didn`t look fresh.  I know that listening is a big part of your job...YOU...back there in the kitchen...I can`t blame a manager for this...YOU listen to what the customer wants and then YOU assemble it. Most of the items on the menu only require a few tweaks and that is it. Your job is done. I only asked you to remove the meat. It still costs me the same...I do not complain about that...ever...I gladly pay you to remove the meat from the pizza...but no one gave you permission to remove everything else.   I wanted to tell this to the manager...I am disabled and no longer drive so I couldn`t drive there to complain...and since you there...standing by the phone...refused to answer even if you put me on hold...you left me no other way to let you know this:  I am so done with  this location. Maybe even Taco Bell. I have eaten at Taco Bell since 1964. Bell-Beefers...mmmmm...yum...that is when Taco Bell was 5 Star dining for a poor college kid.  Tonight I just hope that what little of my order that I did gag down...does not come back to haunt me.<4<12<2019<4<57<18
J4K147uYDcLIdyqpmqduPQ<mzKcnUXVTf-u2QsOLkeqig<O0pjAPQXdPxQ0I6ecCGfnw<1<0<1<0<"Years ago, I vowed to never write a negative Yelp review.  That just changed about 20 minutes ago. I made a very specific order for a 24'" veggie pizza cut into triangles,  not peter piper pizza squares. My pizza was $45 after a moderate $6 tip to the driver. My pizza of course came cut into squares, and it was under cooked. I asked the driver to have the store call me. After I ran out of patients waiting for a call(about 20 minutes later) I picked up the phone and called them. The woman that took my order confirmed that it was wrong, and placed me on hold for another 10 minutes. Then a manager came on the phone and said '"I was going to call you back'", but that they were busy. He then said they could replace the pizza or give me $7 off. I said that I would be in bed asleep by the time another pizza showed up, and asked if they could replace it tomorrow. Again, no. I then let him know that the $7 barely covered the top to the driver. He wouldn`t compromise with me, so I took the limp doughey pizza and put it in my toaster oven to cook it. When I pulled it out I burnt my finger. So now I`m standing in my kitchen with my right hand in a bowl of ice, my left holding a square piece of pizza that I just spent $45 on, and all the while wondering if I should stoop to writing a bad Yelp review. I think yes."<3<12<2019<3<21<2

The food is good, although pricey. Their menu breakfasts are only a few dollars less than their buffet.  However, not everyone can eat that much therefore, a few  modestly priced simple dishes would be appreciated, notwithstanding the excellence of the buffet Dinner choices were tasty. The wait staff seems overwhelmed.  Its easy to get forgotten unless you are assertive.  The biggest negative is their hours.  They advertise online that they are open from 6:30am - 11:00pm.  However, when I walked over from the clinic at 1:45 on Sunday, they were closed.  It would seem that a limited menu could be available at any time   The hours must be set for the convenience of staff rather than guests  So overall, although the food is tasty, the absentminded service and hours force me to rate only 2 stars.<8<12<2019<19<32<10

It`s essentially a concrete echo chamber with zero sound deadening.   My party had to yell at each other the entire time.   It`s just not a warm environment.   More like a cheesy trendy pizza place or nondescript restaurant with no theme or atmosphere.  Like an upscale Chipotle.

What to get: Lemon Black Tea With Tapioca! Or in winter: Any of the hot milk teas!  Generally speaking, Kung Fu Tea scores 5, but it`s usually a low 5, considering that it`s a massive international corporate chain, whose milk teas don`t match up to the best chains: Sharetea, Gong Cha and Coco. However, they`re still really good, and the fruit teas here are among the best. Especially the lemon black tea which absolutely rocks my world.  This location, however, which I have only visited twice, can`t have 5 stars. Because if I`m going to pay this much for a damn bubble tea (over 5 dollars for a large with tapioca), then I expect things to go fairly smoothly. I expect them not to mess up my order (they did the first time) and I expect it not to take 23 minutes to get my tea from the time I got in line (I checked). And it`s not a one off, because at certain times of day, the line is consistently out the door on any given school day (and by school I mean University). So this KFT needs more registers, more employees, and more capacity to churn out the corporate bubble teas, because otherwise, what`s the point? This is Cleveland, not Manhattan.  Still, the Lemon Black Tea is amazing (if they don`t give you green tea instead), so 4 stars.<7<3<2017<10<4<39

It`s true that it`s like 15 months ago but I was told by many dentists that it`s not a time problem. The Dr didn`t do those well. I called them and wanted to know whether they would like to fix the problem. The young lady insisted that I have to pay them to have a check for me. At last I was told that the Dr only would be available two weeks later.  I went there, the Dr checked for me and said there wasn`t any problem. I told her that you can only see the problems from the X-rays, then she asked me for those pics that you can see. I gave her those and she now realized those mistakes that she made BUT she blamed me for not going back to check three months later after those filling were doneWithout those X-rays, how could she knew that she didn`t do those well Finally, she said she can only do one for me, the others were just good in her eyes. I didn`t let her do that because I was told that if I want to fix those I have to redo the fillings near those which she even didn`t mention about.  One more thing, when I did those fillings 13 months ago, I was told by the Dr that I need a deep cleaning which now my new dentist said I don`t need a deep cleaning at all. They only care about money not your teeth I am really disappointed not only because they made a mistake but also because they wouldn`t want to correct that when they have a chance.<30<8<2018<4<12<58

I always have such a great time, but this event was by far the most memorable for me. It was really refreshing to hear what the elderly in our community had to say...and I will never forget their wonderful advice, both beautiful and tragic stories, words of inspiration, and overall presence (especially the Sunrise, Sunset rendition sang by Alex). I wish I could do more than only write a review to express my gratitude for the time Alex, Dorris, and Lilo took to participate in this wonderful event!   A big thanks to David and his vision, Jessi, and Helping Hands for being there to talk about their program/contributions in the elderly community and beyond. Don`t forget that you can donate on the Helping Hands website if you didn`t have enough cash to donate during the event. If you donate $20 it`s enough to feed a senior citizen in our community for a month!  Thank you to Craft Haus for providing the stellar bartenders (Lori and Manny-truly the sweetest bartenders ever!) with positive attitudes, attentive service, and excellent brew. It was all very much enjoyed! Also, thanks to Racheal`s Kitchen for providing the appetizers of smoked turkey avocado sandwiches, the curry salad, and chicken salad...and for the extra sandwiches!  And last, but certainly not least, thank you Kayla for putting this event together and Jeff for your awesome photography skills! I really enjoyed the company of the wise and hope for more of these events with the elderly in the future! I really didn`t know what to expect, but the night certainly surpassed my expectations.

We came here to get shoes that were put on hold for us (see my Performance Footwear review).  My spouse loves the shoes needed for work.  Having a job in which you`re on your feet for  long shifts, one needs shoes that are comfortable.  These shoes are also breathable, and are slip resistant.  The store is in Downtown Summerlin.  There is a large selection of NB shoes at this location.  The store is organized well and was clean.  Areas to sit and try on shoes are available.  There was only one employee at the time we were there, but with only two customers during that moment he was able to help us out easily.  The shoes are not cheap, but not the most expensive sport/work shoe I`ve ever had either.  We are New Balance shoe fans.<6<12<2019<22<8<32

I received the following quote from LV.Net: Mini - Up To 5 Mbps Download / 1 Mbps Upload $50 per month Standard - Up To 15 Mbps Download / 2 Mbps Upload $65 per month Advanced - Up To 25 Mbps Download / 5 Mbps Upload $75 per month Ultra - Up To 50 Mbps Download / 10 Mbps Upload $125 per month $100 Setup fee / 1 year contract NO DATA CAPS  I was willing to pay the monthly fee, but as I have never used the service I wasn`t willing to sign a contract. I said I would be willing to after a reasonable period, or that I would be willing to pay an increased Setup fee.  The response I received came from Upper Management and was absurd.  They said I could pay a $1,500 setup fee ($125 x 12 = $1,500), which is the entire yearly fee, plus an additional $25 a month This changes the first years total cost from $1,600 to $3,300. So I am forced to believe one of two things. The highest level of management cannot do math, which seems unlikely. Or, more likely, the quality of service is so poor that they don`t think I will make it a second month. Any service that requires a contract before you use it, and without any ability to provide the service without an agreement clearly has issues. My advice would be to not waste your time or energy dealing with them. You will likely regret it. There are other WISPs and ISPs in the area. Seek alternatives elsewhere.<17<8<2018<0<42<16

The MGM still charged me for my remaining two nights of stay per my original reservation, which I tried to argue upon my check-out to no avail. I was ok to pay for my first two nights, but, not my remaining two nights or total of 4 nights. They charged me $878 for my remaining two nights I did not stay, but, was still charged $878. There is no sympathy, passion or understanding at this resort.  Therefore, I will no longer stay here again. F` the MGM resorts, which is traded on the NY stock exchange. I will also quit my MLife membership. I will never have any future business with any MGM property or casino anywhere in the world.<8<2<2019<14<15<42

The asian looking girl with the super long hair in a pony tail was very bad. I asked for an extra bowl when our food came..never got it. Not once did she come back to refill water or check up on us. We finished our meal in a quick 30 mins, and it took another 30 mins just to get the check!  I had to go up to her at the kitchen to ask for it after she didn`t notice me raising my hands, wiggling around in my seat, and yelling hello. She was just walking around, punching things at the cash register, chatting, but still no check.  The table next to us came in and they didn`t get to order for about 20 mins since she was just not paying attention to her tables at all. Very frustrating. She wouldn`t even have noticed if we walked out without paying.   The bento box was meh, rolls underwhelming, and the ramen was better.<11<10<2019<18<15<34

A few weeks later, my front brake is squeaking and there is still a strong shimmy in the steering wheel. I bring it back in and they tell me that they never replaced the front brake pads OR did anything with the rotors. Of course now the front rotors can`t be fixed, they can only be replaced and they want $350 for it. Ridiculous. They never even looked at the front brakes the first time.   I have a baby and drive every day with her. I shouldn`t have to wonder or worry about my brakes, especially after taking it to the '"masters'". I would avoid at all costs.

All of this in an Asian mall, Times Square. Businesses around here are not like this place. Just keep in mind this place is not cheap.   The interior design of this place is quite high end and fancy. It is clean and modern. The staff is very friendly and service is above average for the area. There were quite a few staff in the kitchen as well so food came FAST!   All of the items we ordered were good. We had the Beef Stroganoff Omurice, Soft-shell Crab Pineapple Fried Rice, Oolong Latte, and the Matcha Lava cake.  My favourite was the Soft-shell Crab Pineapple Fried Rice, which is a New Menu Item! Oolong Latte had a strong roasted tea flavour which I love. The Stroganoff could have had a few more dimensions of flavour. The egg was the best part! Rice was boring.   Overall a classy spot to chill or have a meal. Very happy with the food quality overall.

5HbJFRrXrI0KHTJiliquHg<RO4Pfma9IUPG9SEPoW3VxA<ViiDxIZuQumH6qOykvzvXQ<3<8<2<3<Wow, this is a tough one! AhDonna,  Lovely woman, chef and owner. Very nice to talk with, and answered all my questions about her operation.  Ordered the lobsta roll, and shrimp fries. First off... On approaching the counter, a young woman sitting at the register looked at me, the only customer and gave a look of disgust and walked away, presumably to get the owner. Not doing you any favors, Ma`am! Lobster roll was good, but $18 is just out of most people`s budget for a sandwich. I had the tater tots with it, large portion, but so spicy I could only eat a few. Not down grading for that, just personal taste. Shrimp fries were good, crinkle cuts with nice shrimps on top. Good, but not something I could live without. Here`s the problem. The owner is cooking home style, which doesn`t necessarily translate to counter take out. Each part of each order is prepared individually, creating a very slow process. My simple order took over 20 minutes. People behind me were told to expect 30 minutes. Looking at other Yelp reviews, I can`t help think the reviews are overinflated for sentimental reasons other than a realistic evaluation.  We would all like to see this Charming lady succeed, hopefully, honest evaluation will help!<13<10<2019<19<34<12

They also dented/scratched my brand new car.  NEVER again!  The GM is rude, sales people have the nerve to call to try to sell me another car!  Why?  So your service department can wreck it as well?  No thanks!  Check the mileage before leaving it at service and do a walk around video taping it.

Yoe7Kr2RUAqh8_ZADkHjSg<MOxi8KcK4U1X16hfmsSJ7A<rr5U04fBhh9VjdWZ9UKbOw<4<0<0<0<Lockdown Escape rooms was a great experience and will be one of the locations that I will make it back so I can try the other ones. We did The Cursed Cabin at this location and while we didn`t escape we had a great time. Before I get into the details of this review I have to say that the best part of this location is the staff; the young lady whose name unfortunately escapes me was absolutely wonderful. We were promptly welcomed and truly made to feel values, she was so sweet I would go back there regardless how I felt about the actual escape rooms just to support her in her job security; just a wonderful experience.   Okay so the escape room itself can best be described by thinking and calling it something along the lines of a classic escape room or a location that is getting back to basics. What I mean by this is the rooms are very reminiscent of what I remember some of the original escape rooms being like when they first were becoming popular. The rooms are all one single room and for the most part they are fairly limited in atmosphere, most everything in the room is part of the puzzle there isn`t additional decoration to add to the ambiance. The story lines are somewhat weak, they exist for the purpose of having a reason to be in an escape room but these rooms are very heavily puzzle based and very limited in story line immersion. The puzzles themselves are challenging while still being playable, mostly a progressive number of clues leading to number based locks.   While it may sound like I am talking down on the location I am really not, I very much enjoyed the game and the location. I liked getting back to basics, I have been in escape rooms that in hind sight may have had too much emphasis on the atmosphere and the puzzles suffer as a result. As I said since the room is a single room there is a very good focus on the puzzles and the play-ability of the game. This would be a location that I would recommend for people who really enjoy the critical thinking elements of an escape room more than they do the theatrics. I think Lockdown has a smaller presence in the Las Vegas offerings but I would highly recommend checking them out. They are affordable, friendly, and a lot of fun; best of luck everyone.<5<11<2019<22<5<38

q8WPnknycMpsw7NBM0wusA<mOpHlZciACon_WQYUcHhwg<74vqVbTFUYqvSqrBiVj6RA<1<2<0<0<I have lived in the Arlington and Cavendish. I would only recommend this company if you are a grad student living there for a short period around 1 year and on a tight budget. The location is convenient and the rent is cheaper than other places, but it`s because the apartments are very old, unclean, and in disrepair. They do not clean your apartment before you move in.   You will probably be submitting maintenance requests every other week. Maintenance people do usually come within 24 hours, but they leave a mess in your apartment and sometimes don`t fix the issue. Like other people said, maintenance sometimes suspiciously enters your apartment even when you did not submit a request and never tells you why. If you live in the Arlington, Mondays around noon they shut off the water for an hour or two and at other random times. This is not stated anywhere and you can imagine how inconvenient it is to have random water shut offs without notice in advance.  They require you to tell them if you will renew the lease or not within 6 months of your lease ending. This is absurd since leases are for 12 months and most places ask for 2 months in advance. Put off telling them you will not renew for as long as possible. As soon as you tell them you will not renew, they will break all the rules to try to rent out your apartment. You know the 24 hours notice rule? It`s a joke to them, I have had them phone me and come by 15 minutes later. They lie and say that apartments are usually taken within 1-2 showings. I have had about 10 over the course of 2 months and you can imagine how annoying it is to have people constantly in and out of your apartment. Who knows how many more I`ll have.<9<3<2019<16<24<55

I`ve lived here for almost a year and can`t wait for my lease to be up to get out of here! All my neighbors around me have moved also due to this place being crap. I feel sorry for the new tenants that move in....they don`t know whats coming.   The management of this place is just absolutely horrible. Our toilet has been leaking for OVER A MONTH (floor will flood if we don`t put a towel down) and we have put several '"maintenance requests'" but they never show up and when we went to the office the office staff YELLED at my boyfriend saying that they have been there over 3 times and no one has been home which is absolutely false someone is always home at all times. After that they said they would come Tuesday (our day off) to fix it......no one showed.....eventually someone came a couple days later but they came at the time we told them we would have to leave for work..... so the maintenance guy  looked at our toilet and said it might be fixed (of course it wasn`t). And still is not fixed to this day.....  Another huge problem (again with management and maintenance) is with the grounds. The sprinklers are CONSTANTLY broken and never fixed around the complex. As i was sitting in my car I witnessed a maintenance man RUN OVER a sprinkler in his golf cart and you could hear the snap. My boyfriend then proceeded to tell another maintenance man who was there and he literately said nothing and didn`t care. Still not fixed 3 weeks later and floods the grass and sidewalk when its on. Not to mention that since I moved in there is a sprinkler by the pool that when it turns on it literally shoots up about 6 ft in the air not kidding!!! I don`t know how that hasn`t been fixed....so much water wasted in this place just from the broken sprinklers.   Dogie bags are never filled, you constantly hear neighbors and outside people, layout is terrible and no natural light in apartments, the list just goes on.   Just don`t move here.....this place might lure you in with their deals but you can find somewhere so much nicer for the same price."<2<9<2015<18<50<7

wcPfhoapR8wxLLZGESnZ8Q<-VYTt_KokEeJenYNissR3Q<Z0YOHYA6YtW131xULbnMzQ<1<3<4<0<"I remember coming here when I was a little kid with my family, and  the food was very good.  Fast forward 20+ years and I decided to take my family here.  I looked at the reviews on yelp and everyone seemed to rave about the oxtail soup.   We arrived around 10 PM tonight, and met '"Maria'" our hostess.  Man....she must of been having a bad day because she did not smile once when she greeted us, and seemed like she didn`t want to be at work.  Not a good first impression for customers.    Well we finally get seated and the first thing she ask me is '"Are you ordering the prime rib?  If you are you only have a few minutes.'"  I told her I think I`m gonna get the oxtail soup.  She tells me '"if you are gonna order the soup you have to go outside and wait back in line until 11p.'"  I told her no that`s fine, I`ll order something else.    She storms off, and proceeds to mumble something to her fellow coworker. While waiting for our waiter...she keeps staring me down like I did something wrong.  Again as she walks by my table she tells the waiter that I have to go back outside if I am ordering the soup.  I`m thinking in my head...wow what did I do to piss her off. I`ve been nothing but polite to her and the rest of the staff.   Well we finally get our food and guess what...we find a black hair in my son`s wonton soup.  At this point I am furious because of all the smart remarks she told us, and the digusting hair in our soup.  Fortunately the waiter did not charge us for the soup and one of the other entrees.    So unfortunately I did not get to try the oxtail soup, and have given 1 star for the rude service.  I did file a complaint with the supervisor who was polite and had me write a statement, as '"Maria'" has been a problem before.    Maybe next time I`ll come back to try the oxtail soup when Maria no longer works there.  By the way I have a weird feeling Maria put the black hair in our food but have no way of knowing.   I took a picture of maria as she is giving us the evil death stare....lol."<11<9<2014<7<27<5

Shop calls Hertz again just so they can say under staff and I couldn`t be picked up. They could have mentioned that from the beginning. Kindly one of the workers from the shop gave me a ride to Hertz. I get their just to find out they don`t have an SUV like they said they would. They put me in a regular car and advised me that they will have a bigger SUV for me the next day at 8:30am. I give them a call the next day at 8:30am just to find out they still didn`t have the SUV! SUV wasn`t even ready until after 3:30pm that day. When I got their the SUV was not even their I still had to wait for them to arrive with it. Never again will I use them!<13<11<2019<18<6<53

Talize does have some nice items, but they charge too much.  We have noticed their prices have consistently gotten higher, especially in the last year.  I noticed this price hike about two years ago, with this year being the worst.  All the items are donated, so I am surprised by their high prices.  I have also noticed they are no longer being careful of what they put out for sale (with high prices) that should actually be thrown out in the garbage.  Buyer beware!  Careful examine the items and make sure they are worth the price.  And overall the customer service is less than satisfactory.  Some of the staff can be downright rude, especially management.  I have seen one Cashier being very rude to an older woman in line at the Mississauga location.  Nowadays there are a lot more thrift stores, so don`t be afraid to shop elsewhere.

Cue Yelp and Bagelmania. Lots of storefront parking and numerous tables inside.  When I walked in, I was immediately greeted by the staff who were eager to assist me, though I confessed I needed a little time to look over the menu, which they handed to me. I was craving a breakfast bagel sandwich but for some reason had trouble seeing it on the paper menu. The owner (I assume) laid out the options for me on the wall menu and I realized it was categorized under '"Bagelwiches.'" Ordered a Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Bagelwich and a Bialy with cream cheese to go. Though it was still early on a weekend morning with few patrons inside, they were fulfilling large delivery orders, but I waited no longer than 10 minutes to receive mine with a couple packets of hot sauce in the bag by request.  The Bagelwich was good (though it was on a Sesame bagel rather than the Everything bagel I ordered--not a big deal because it was still delicious), and the Bialy was huge! and filling.   The owner personally thanked me for coming in--I suppose it was obvious I was just visiting--which was a thoughtful gesture.

mb9ctNCRXNt-LFE_MwHJXg<bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw<We16v_WgJei5cedG50OLTQ<4<29<12<23<Dim sum brunch on Sundays is one of my favorite things. I gathered a group of my favorite gals and scheduled a meal here, and things went pretty well. Going with a group is key to share several dishes. There are carts that go around as well as a full menu to order from- note that the majority of the seafood and all of the bbq items are on the separate menu.   Location is fairly nice, several large tables in the back room for groups. They were very busy when we went (1pm Sunday), I do recommend making a reservation. Everything we tried here was fairly well done, but it seemed there were some key dim sum dishes that never came around, like salt and pepper shrimp, BBQ buns, and the shrimp-chive dumplings. Eventually we found most of them on the menu, and they can be specially ordered. Unclear whether they have soup dumplings. Service during our visit was typical for dim sum- haphazard at best, drinks filled on request only, maybe this is worse in the back room.   Standout dishes here were the egg tarts (amazing crust, so buttery and flaky!), seafood pan fried noodle (family size portion), crispy pork belly (great sauce too), and the shumai (bf`s new fave). We all left stuffed and split the bill at about $25/pp, which is about on par with other places in town. I would come back for dinner to try their duck and seafood dishes- however, an observant friend did note that their seafood prices are on the steep side.<22<8<2019<15<46<19

I was so looking forward to running the Las Vegas marathon for the third time, but it looks like this will be my last. It just did not appear that the race organization had their heart into planning a marathon this year. If I had to give a highlight it would be nothing more than there were enough bathrooms. Other than that, quite lackluster. There were no announcements or signs directing people on how and where to get to their corral, many mile points had no markers. Water stations were very sparsely manned and kept runners waiting for water or Gatorade and I am far from the only one as being confused with the course. Many people were upset and angry as they had no freaking idea where to go or what mile they should be on. As it turns out I finished the race -10 miles early. Imagine how disheartening that would`ve been if I was someone from out of town and had to spend the money to travel as well as the entry fee.  If there was a change in the course due to finish times, someone should have been there informing people.  Something!  But runners were literally left in the dark wondering what in the hell was going on. Here`s hoping next years race director is more organized and has the runners best interest at heart.<18<11<2019<5<42<12

My daughter purchased a necklace with charm for a Mother`s Day gift for my wife and after owning it for a few months the charm broke. My wife had only worn the necklace a few times, so we took it back to Tiffany`s and assumed that they would repair it for us. Instead of acknowledging that the charm shouldn`t have broke like it did, they blamed my wife and charged her $84. If she had owned this for a while I might understand, but this necklace was barely worn. There was clearly a problem with the quality of the piece. The customer service at Tiffany`s was very disappointing, and the fact that they didn`t stand behind the quality of their products is very sad. We will be shopping elsewhere in the future.<21<12<2018<15<57<51

I was a Board Member and worked with them frequently regarding one HOA.  Watch out!   They were terrible - both from a homeowner perspective and that as a Board Member.   Of the 10 or so property management companies I have dealt with, they were one of the worst.   They were non-responsive. They assigned us multiple property managers within a short period and therefore our association got worse and worse service (whether the fault of the individual manager or not) simply because of the frequent turnover.   They repeatedly hired or recommended specific companies that heftily overcharged for services (I started to question whether TMT owners had ownership interests in those companies given the high prices and insistence using their recommended companies).

When I called to inquire, I spoke with Megan. She informed me they called the lien holder (Kia Motor Finance) who said there was no lien on the car. She then instructs me I was going to be responsible for towing and impound fees. I told her I was not paying that as Towbin Kia was supposed to call Kia and have them come get it. I called yesterday 8.19 and told them I spoke to Kia Motor Finance who informed me neither Towbin Kia NOR the Tow Truck Company called Kia Motor Finance to get the car. They informed me they '"don`t call lien holders.'" I said that`s not what you told me last month. They then inform me if Kia wants the car, they need to get it because it`s up for auction in ten days.

The education is fantastic!  You have to apply yourself and if you are having troubles there are classmates, project staff, and instructors that will help you.  I`ve read other reviews on here and I don`t know if things have changed with the instructors or with the quality if students, but I had no problem getting help and was never chastised by my instructors.    I did my internship at an A/V rental shop, in Las Vegas, doing Audio Tech work.  NOT what I went to school for, but it was paying and I have a family.  I figured I would learn as much as I could on the tech side of things and network, network, network.  I set up a small home studio, cut a couple tracks for a couple artists out here talked to anyone and everyone I could in the business and one day I got offered a FOH touring position with a small local Vegas band and was out and off on the road.  Touring isn`t for me. Lol, but I did it and I know that now.  I am now back in Vegas, freelancing.  Not always the most glamorous gigs, I`m currently doing a corporate gig... Sitting here typing this review because there`s nothing else for me to do at the moment, but its still fun flying PAs and playing with audio.  I never feel like I`m working, plus, what I made in one week touring I make in one day freelancing.  I know this isn`t a typical review, but I give you this because what I did, that I don`t think other people did who have given very negative reviews, was take what was given to me and ran with it.    Very few of us are going to be winning Grammy`s and I honestly never wanted to do that anyway.    I do studio work, I do live sound, I do odd audio jobs from cleaning up tracks sent to me over the internet to recording odd sounds for video games and other media.  You will probably never hear of me winning a Grammy or being FOH for the next big artists, but I do what I love and I make very good money doing it.  It took me a little over a year and a half to get where I am today.  There were ups and downs, but I`m here now and the hard times are what made me more diligent and made me work harder to achieve what I wanted.  I am now currently in the process of opening up a studio within the next 18 months and it just seems like everything is going better and better!  Work hard at school and in a short time you won`t be working at all.  You`ll be getting paid to have fun!!!<10<12<2014<23<42<20

This particular Rolled Ice Cream location is located in the Centennial Plaza. You can get to the Centennial Plaza by either taking the 215/Durango (NW), or 95/Buffalo exit (south-bound), or 95/Ann (north-bound). Rolled Ice Cream shares a private lot, next to several other restaurants and local businesses.  Inside Rolled Ice Cream, on a Wednesday evening, was relatively relaxing. There wasn`t many people inside. 2 team members were assisting customers with their Rolled Ice Cream orders.  My boyfriend and I waited about 10 minutes before placing our order. My boyfriend ended up getting a advocado/strawberry and cream [large] order while I ordered the birthday cake [small order], no sprinkles and chocolate syrup/whip cream.  The team member whom was creating the order was pretty awesome! He really combined the ingredients well and rolled it perfectly. The process is really interesting to watch. They combine the sweet cream and ingredients, flatten it with a spatula, and roll it out.   The price wasn`t too bad for a large and small order, under $12.00. Inside Rolled Ice Cream is the option for bar stool seating, and several booth style tables. We ended up sitting at the bar stool seating to eat the Rolled Ice Cream!  It was quite flavorful and delicious! I could really taste the '"birthday'" style flavoring. The whip cream and chocolate syrup was a nice added touch!

Not wanting to make a huge commitment, against my better judgment, she decided she wanted a prepaid phone, just to see if it worked with her lifestyle. She picked one out and we went to the desk to purchase it. They told her that she would have to go to the Verizon store to get it activated, that they were not able to help her with that (lies). So, we left with the phone and headed to the Verizon Store. Incidentally, I don`t know his name, but this guy was rude and his tone was talking down to my mother and I did not like it. We had been told by a man on the floor that Verizon could transfer her contacts to the new phone but they rude man at the desk laughed in our faces, telling us that Verizon would not offer or be able to transfer her contacts (more lies; keep your competition out of the customers faces).  Meanwhile, at the Verizon store, they told us that it had not been set up properly by Best Buy, and that the phone was not in their system. We would have to return to BB and have to enter it into the system properly.   Okay, annoyed, we returned to BB, told them the story. They laughed unprofessionally and told us that was wrong, and that it had been entered into the system properly. I don`t care who`s fault it was, or what kind of strong man contest BB is having with Verizon, I wanted to activate this phone and be on our way!  So now, all of a sudden, BB was able to get in touch with Verizon and activate our phone, they said. After about an hour of this guy trying to get it set up, another customer came up to the desk and he set our phone down and started helping him. I`m super annoyed at this time, but didn`t say anything. Evidently there was an issue setting our phone up and he was trying to reset it and get it working. We finally said, '"Maybe there`s something wrong with the phone; can we try a different phone?'" No response or acknowledgment that we had asked a question, he continued to help the other customer. I had to leave the desk and take a walk around the store. When I returned, still the same issues, and we finally said to the guy, '"Can we just return the phone and get our money back?'" He said sure, but we would not be able to transfer the phone number back onto her old phone.   We returned the phone and left the store with my mother in tears, and no phone. We later found out that there were so many changes made to our account that it had locked us out. We had to change my mother`s phone number in order to get her a phone. I think that if we were purchasing a more expensive phone we would have been treated better. It`s a shame that this store keeps products that they discourage people from buying and I don`t think I`ll return to a BB ever again."<7<11<2019<20<37<49

For a weekday matinee, what possible reason is there to have only one line open when about 10 people are waiting in the 100+ weather to buy tickets?  Then, the air/con inside the ticket room is so powerful that it pushes money and tickets around at the little hole they use to interact with the clients?  At the concessions, why are there about at least 6-7 cashier/ordering spots and only 1-2 open? What would cause you to have a line of 12-15 and not open another cashier???  c.  Stuff - 4 Star - OK, like all places all the normal food. I do like the fact that the large popcorn is in a tub and not a bag. Free refils on large popcorn and soda.  That is a pretty good deal.  d.  Theater - 3 Star - If you are lucky to have a movie in one of their large auditoriums, you get a great cinematic experience. Unfortunately if you get one of the small auditoriums, you get a rinky dink theater screen and it is a just average experience.  The facility is old and getting wornout. It is due for some kind of basic upgrade. Why not let you roam through the lobby and order food while someone else is ordering the tickets? Here you have to use your tickets before you get to the food area. Not efficient  e.  Prices - 4 Star - Now I don`t remember, but on Tuesdays they have a great deal on movies and their other prices are similar to everywhere.  Overall , 3 Star - this is a tired place and if you want to full experience, I would say that AMC 16 (rave) is the place to go and perhaps Brendan Theaters.    I like coming here for a quick movie, but otherwise, I like AMC 16."<25<7<2013<1<56<46

They got it all wrong. The beans are the most important thing and they give you the smallest spreading of beans!  It feels like a rice and lettuce burrito.

Atmosphere: Very welcoming, upbeat, friendly, casual and not to forget the great playlist! The staff were very nice, attentive and pretty fast paced. The decor inside gives a Jetsons kind of vibe, very cool.  Food: AMAZING!! Nothing negative to say about it. I had the I Like You E`lote dish it was Quinoa cakes with some amazing chili lime sauce(I forgot the other one ) & my 2 friends both had the breakfast burritos.   We had a little issue with one of my friends food. She ordered Shrimp & Grits (which is a pretty popular dish) we aren`t sure what happened but she ended up with the wrong order. They apologized and 15-20 mins later she got her shrimp & grits. The shrimp was rubbery and way too cooked, very hard to chew and swallow BUT we knew it was probably a bad little batch because it`s a very popular and highly recommended dish. No biggie. It was sent back  and exchanged for the breakfast burrito. This was not a deal breaker things happen. The service, people, and overall vibe overshadows this small bump. Her food was comp`d which was also a great gesture and very thoughtful.  Wait Time: The wait time was as predicted, an hr & change and to some that might be too much. You can mingle and have drinks so it didn`t feel long at all! For it being the peak of brunch hours this was extremely reasonable, we went to 2 other spots before this one and the wait was 2hrs+! Someone told us the trick is to go a little closer to their closing time to avoid the wait lol   The general manager CHRIS was an absolute sweetheart. We knew as soon as we saw him that he ran the place. Such genuine interest in the business and his job. Even if the food were to be bad we would come back just because of the service! Thank you Chris for showing such love in what you do!  I live in Dallas but this will be my go to for sure whenever I come to Houston. Stop by if you`re ever in the area!<7<11<2017<17<46<3
hJo2XM9vknPFBVxfEyzfkQ<An6oDLKb60skfwqbx0CmRw<utIA0LyQmwP-9DRyxUe6qQ<1<3<4<0<"I have been to snooze dozens of times in AZ and CO, never have I had bad service and the food is always great. Since the houston location opened I`ve made it in a few times, each time we have received terrible service..or no service at all.    Yesterday, we came in with a party of 3. We were quoted 1 1/2 hr. So two of us went to attempt to get drinks at the bar. This has never been a good idea. Each time we have sat at the bar we get served by two red head females who are very rude and short. Orders have always been wrong and it takes well over 20 mins to even put an order in when sitting infront of them. It seems as if they don`t feel obligated to serve anyone and purposely move as slow as possible so that they don`t have to work as hard..or just plain rude and stupid. Back to yesterday, we waited around the bar for 40 minutes desperately trying to get someone`s attention so that we could order beverages during our long wait. Not one time did anyone acknowledge us or anyone else trying to get their attention. After 40 minutes of the two red head bartenders ignoring us and moving slower than any syrup they serve, a barback came over and took our order. Closed us out but only brought back 1 of 3 drinks. We said forget it and went back outside to wait. Once the 90 min time frame was over we asked how much longer. The hostess told us 20 more mins. We waited the 20 mins. No luck. We went inside to ask and we were then told 30-40 more minutes. Really? People who came after us had ate and left all in the time we were still waiting. They said parties of two were getting bumped up but I continued to watch parties of 4 be seated that were on the list after us. Why? I asked. No explanation. We asked for a manager. Emily came out, I told her from the beginning about the terrible bar service and not being able to even get a drink. Emily then went to get the GM Chris. Who was not helpful at all, had no explanation as to why his staff behind the bar wouldn`t help us other than there was only two of them. I never saw Chris or Emily walking the floor for the entire time we had been waiting. So if they were short staffed, why were they not helping? Also, after telling Chris and Emily we weren`t able to get drinks they never even offered to help us get their attention again or help us out in an order. Chris continued to say '"ok.'" After everything we told him that occurred along with other similar experiences. It was clear he could careless about keeping guest. Really dry and bland staff as a whole. The GM Chris is just as bad as his mute, slow, unfriendly and worthless bartenders. Be prepared to wait. Try getting a drink at the bar so you can see how big of a joke this place is."<10<4<2017<18<56<10

I always get the OMG French Toast and the Benny Goodman, both of which are and delicious. Anytime family or friends come to visit Houston, i make it a point to take them to brunch here. It`s super packed during the weekends, so on a day off I`ll come here on the weekdays and just wait 15 minutes as opposed to 1.5 hours, but either way the wait is totally worth it. I normally go peruse books at half price books across the street while I wait. I especially like it because all of the staff are very warm, kind, and understanding. They try to be as accommodating as possible. I can`t say enough great things about this place. Totally worth it!<6<12<2016<21<10<23

There was approximately 10mins of waiting time to be seated as we didn`t make a reservation in advance. Overall it`s a nice place for large groups as the restaurant is very spacious.   The food was delicious but the dessert needs some tweaking in the recipe for sure. We ordered the cheesy artichoke dip, garlic bread, mamma`s signature pizza & da Greek pizza and it was all delicious.. the pizza had fresh ingredients and we were all feeling very light after our meal which is not typical when it comes to pizza. Definitely coming back for pizza dinner with a lovely ambience.  However, we decided to experiment with dessert- considering Italian restaurants don`t go wrong when it comes to delicious desserts so we ordered Boudino- but we were certainly disappointed big time..9 of us just tasted and couldn`t even finish the spoonful of this dessert it was beyond tangy and bad tasting. We just had to throw away the rest. I`m assuming the dessert was stale and had gone bad. By far the worst dessert I have ever had as nothing was sweet about it not even bittersweet.  Nothing exceptional about service- the server put us to work by keeping all the glasses of water in front of me and made me pass along the glasses filled to the brim which caused some good amount of spill on our plates :/<27<11<2019<21<58<58

Dr. Yeung is a skilled surgeon with a caring attitude.  He takes his time with you to diagnose what is happening with your back pain, and he explains what`s wrong and how he`s going to take away the pain.  The support staff is courteous and friendly.  I would recommend him to anyone who has crippling pain as I had before my surgery.<9<12<2015<15<10<11

However out of the maybe 5-7 times I ordered delivery, about half of the times my order was incorrect. Each time the receipt would show the correct order but I`d open up the food containers and something completely different would be inside. I`m not sure how they handle mobile orders, I used DoorDash each time, but the fact that the receipt on the bag showed the correct order and it was still wrong was very frustrating. If this had only happened once I wouldn`t give it a second thought, but it was a recurring problem here.  The food is good but I`d recommend using take out so you can check your order is right.<6<11<2019<19<35<57

If you want to see a snake that looks like it take the first ledge you give and completely slithering himself into the great beyond go here after you call to get in. Not to mention the snake in an enclosure behind a bookcase... I`m not smart but I don`t think snakes can read... absolutely disgusting husbandry, tank conditions, and healthcare of animals I`ve ever seen in the pheonix valley. I would report this place if I knew who to call. Also on top of the fact that the ball pythons are over priced for a snake that is dying and mistreated. I paid 350 for a pied ball and this place wants 800 for one with the worst stuck shed I`ve seen in my life. So if you want a snake with the same demeanor as a emo 7th grader who wants to die and about as sick as an unvaccinated child be my guest and waste your money here.<27<11<2019<0<56<13
KWyvHXii8vNsqhvAfBmEiA<IhbfHxnvrwB2SHXK4buM7Q<BdL7pcmvpw38-i1zH7f6fA<1<7<0<0<"When I first moved in here two years ago when P.B. Bell managed, the office staff was super friendly and I felt it was worth the price. Now that Escape is under new management, I can`t say the same. The grounds used to be clean and office staff was friendly. I transferred from a one bedroom apartment to a two bedroom within the community a year ago. Upon inspection, the maintenance crew told me I would not be charged. The carpet was pulled up and frayed near a bedroom door and one wall had two large holes from a TV wall mount. Even still, I was told it was fine and that the carpet would have to be replaced anyway and touch ups are done before new residents move in. In the present, my lease just ended and an inspection had to be done by the new management crew. First off, Brenden was extremely rude to me while doing the inspection. He told me it was not normal wear and tear and would be at least 200 dollars to patch up the carpet. The '"damages'" in the second apartment are not as bad as the first. The only reason I did not fix the TV holes on wall and rug, is because I was not charged last time. Every time I tried to reason with Brandon he raised his voice at me and said there is no use talking to me I don`t get it. I recently spoke to the manager Chris Carrol and it was as if I was speaking to Brendens twin. He even tried to charge me 55 for the touch up paint for the two holes on wall when Brenden said it would only be 20. He also stated that they are good friends outside of work and said that I shouldn`t have made smart alec comments to Brenden. Overall, this has been a nightmare. I would not recommend these apartments to anyone and it is not worth the price. Not by a long shot. Beware the greedy management crew!!! They want to steal from residents now that everyone is moving out and no longer care to live there."<17<7<2018<0<26<47

XW94x15qOvylArD5Q39nLw<Gy5YsiNwg-w0PyhupXPg9w<LDTFQT1ivK_6tSHcQNqUyg<1<6<0<0<"I initially went in because as I was leaving Smiths I noticed a sign on the door that says $9 a unit. What they don`t tell you till later is that it`s $9 units of Dysport and you have to buy $250 worth of units. It takes more Dysport to equal a ML of Botox so in the end you are spending more.  Anyways, this is only my second time getting,'"Botox,'" but when Olivia touched my face she told me, '"you have tissue scaring all over your temples and forehead from all the previous Botox you had.'" When in all actuality I had only had Botox one time before then about 3 years prior  and not in the spots she was explaining which led me to feel like she was just saying that for whatever reasons.  Once she started the procedure I explained to her I`d like my 11`s, one line on my upper forehead and some laugh lines around my eyes. She expressed to me that I needed way more Botox in my case Dysport then what I initially purchased . (I have no wrinkles unless I smile so them going alway entirely was not my concern only to look a little more refreshed)  Anyways on to the actual injections. I believe once I was not forking up anymore money the service quality was not as up to par. The numbing creme she used did absolutely nothing at all and instead of being gentle she was very forceful and quick and instead of talking her way through my pain she just kept going. The Dr. I had went to previously talked me through it even though the numbing creme he used did it`s job and I was in no pain.   Also a little side note, Olivia had placed the injections directly on my 11`s instead of the muscle that controls the contraction of the the 11`s which is actually located above the eyebrows. That right there led me to believe she is not fully knowledgeable of where the injection site should be. Again the same thing when she did my crows feet, on the actual wrinkle itself. The only place she did in the correct spot was my forehead but I think it`s very obvious to get that correct.  In conclusion there are places that offer better services for a lot cheaper with a more knowledgeable staff. I definitely think they should hire staff with at least a Nursing degree other than Olivia she seems way to busy to be the only one doing injections. The lady in the front was very sweet and kind. But please rethink visiting this place at least until they educate themselves a little bit more."<31<10<2018<0<7<1

I found this dentist in Yelp, did the whole X-rays and everything, then had my 6 month review.   Dr Hao was not there for this review, and no other Dr was in attendance. The dental assistant ended up chipping off one of my caps on my teeth.  They still charged me the same amount even though the main dentist wasn`t there. I emailed them after I realized my chipped tooth, and they didn`t say they would replace it.   Anyway my personal experience hasn`t been a 5-star. More like a 2 or a 3.<26<12<2016<14<10<45

The first vet was very kind and caring but having him going back three days in a row and knowing something bad would happen. I was upset all week trying to do what I could to save him. The vet comes out in the front where other people are when they can hear our conversation. I felt like that was very unprofessional that they couldn`t take me back into a room to tell me what was going on. This would be a private thing they knew how upset o was about what my cat was going through. I felt like I couldn`t even speak my mind because people around could hear us talking. I wish I remembered her name but she made me very angry.  Honestly never going here again loved it at first the staff is not what I got at first.

The providers and medical staff I`ve seen for myself and one of my teens were all good. I know Dermatologists don`t need a lot of time to do their job, so quick visits are OK.   Cons: We had a frustrating problem with aftercare. Refills weren`t sent in, when I called to request them their system was down, 4 days later (last Thursday and Friday) I called them about 10 times trying to get through to anyone. Their call center agents either said (a) '"let me see if someone at the office is there'" in which I was on hold for 10 minutes and then hung up on, or (b) '"our system is down and we can`t look for you, please call back later.'" Other times I couldn`t even reach their call center. So today when I called they were back online, but its as if I never called to make any refill request and I`m at square one.

Ahnk39zJlY90SLw97KqMmQ<iiP8LZzU3RT72sjTRW92KQ<S8jQztEAObUAbW6aeRFqjQ<5<0<0<0<Last summer I had a couple tastes of the chicken from the mobile smoker that was located in the same place I was doing some work for a couple weeks, and it was very good.  Later I spoke to one of the smoker gods that make this delicacy, and they told me that a restaurant was being opened a mile down the road in a month or two.  Today I stopped finally and was able to sample a couple items, two types of smoked Brats (regular, and cheese/jalapeño version) which were good but seemed rather standard. Also I tried a bit of the brisket which was quite amazing in appearance as well as texture and flavors. So I ordered a to go box consisting of the Brisket and two sides. Of the 5-6 offerings I chose the Apple Pie Baked Beans and the Macaroni & Cheese.  The sandwich was as I expected, fresh, tender and moist. The bark was perfectly charred and if I could smoke my brisket as good as these guys, I wouldn`t NEED to return, but I would anyway. But I can`t do that just yet. The Baked Beans were incredible! I forgot that there was also some apple sauce or something that the very helpful young guy who served me had mentioned, so I ate a couple bites and sat in wonder at the yet unrecognized sweetness was from. Upon looking closely at the beans themselves I saw what I initially thought was a bit of bacon fat, but upon tasting it, it was clearly a cinnamon spiced apple slice!  The White Cheddar Mac n Cheese was little shell pastas and a white cheese cream sauce, it had a blend including American cheese adding a component that I love! I look forward to my next visit, which may very well be tomorrow, since I know I`ll be driving past at least once.<17<4<2019<20<13<17
sszY6UVQxa5sURjKGl4Ffw<COPkS6scU93I5ISmajqv9g<eJKnymd0BywNPrJw1IuXVw<3<0<0<1<I had just flown into Vegas late night and came straight to Fremont street to meet up with the bachlorette squad who was super lit and ready to eat. I have to say, Nacho Daddy wasn`t our first pick but the bride-to-be wanted Mexican food. So aiming to please, I hopped on Yelp looking for open late Mexican spots nearby and sure enough Nacho Daddy`s restaurant popped up.  The restaurants neon signage made it easy to spot. I was surprised how dim and moody the lighting was. Our group of about 8 women were able to sit at the bar and since it was a week day there weren`t too many other patrons inside. Our bartender was very professional and attentive to everyone making sure to get our drink orders correct and timely. She even helped us with the menu and questions.   I had a couple of regular shots but I believe Nacho Daddy`s is known for their Scorpio shot (any shot of liquor you want w/ a keepsake shot glass and of course a scorpion). If you`re brave enough to try (which I wasn`t) it would definitely amp up your experience here. I also ordered the filet mignon nachos. Just a pile of chips with not so great salsa and steak. I could`ve used more chips though because that salsa topping was massive. My coworker ordered the corn which is their own version of the Mexican elote, I was excited to try it but sadly it disappointed me too.   I mean I wouldn`t mind coming back to try other stuff on the menu but if you`re looking for authentic Mexican, I can`t recommend this place.<25<11<2019<23<16<45

This is, without a doubt, one of the rare '"Old Vegas'" feeling places left in town.  There are really only a handful of spots (in my opinion) that give off that old school, rat pack, Las Vegas ambiance.   Nestled close to the Outlet Mall on Las Vegas Blvd sits the Bootlegger.  A large restaurant, that has earned the right to claim that they are always busy.  I called and made a reservation, because we had 5 people dining on a Saturday night, and I wanted to make sure that we didn`t have to wait too long for a table.  We were seated right away.  Our server...I believe his name was Cody, was very personable and extremely knowledgeable.  We got a brief history of the restaurant, and he offered some recommendations.   We ordered: The Hot Antipasti Sampler:  Shrimp Scampi, Ravioli, and fried calamari.  These were all absolutely delicious.  They even served the squid tentacles, in addition to just the rings: out of this world!  Osso Bucco:  Petit veal shanks served with saffron risotto, asparagus tips, zucchini, and tomato.  This was incredible.  The veal was falling off the bone and was SO tender!  The risotto was rich, and cooked perfectly.    Saltimbocca:  Veal wrapped around salami and cheese, served with linguine alfredo:  This was amazing.  My husband thought they were a little heavy on the salami, but that didn`t stop him from devouring every  last bite!  Scaloppinw di Vitello:  Veal Piccata style with lemons and capers. So delicious!  This will be a repeated dish, 100%  Eggplant parmesean:  Probably the best Eggplant parm I`ve ever eaten.  So good.  Our other friend ordered a sausage dish that was out of this world, but I don`t remember what it was called.    In addition to the awesome service, beautiful ambiance, and amazing food, we were seated next to the piano, where we were serenaded by a crooner style singer/piano player for part of our meal.  If you have any auditory issues or difficulty hearing conversation in loud environments, you might call for a reservation and request a table away from the piano.  It was a little hard for me to hear what the table was saying, but I have difficulty in light noise.    All in all, this was a very memorable night, and a delicious dinner.  I highly recommend Bootlegger, and definitely have plans to go again.  When 5 of us were able to eat and be full and satisfied for under $200, its absolutely a win.  (We didn`t drink..)"<10<10<2019<11<55<14

This place was dead (just how I like it!)!!! I was expecting a mad house due to the reviews on here. I honestly checked to make sure it was open before getting my son down. I forgot to do their waiver ahead of time but luckily it was super easy and quick. It didn`t ask for addresses, driver license #s, SSN (I`m kidding) nothing! Grip socks required.  The 3yrs and under play area was okay! Nothing super spectacular, my child was over it after like 30mins. It wasn`t super messy! He decided he wanted to go thru the big tree...  It is way too hard to follow your little one in there!!! It is definitely catered to 5yrs+ kids and not adults. Small openings..  '"fireman poles'" everywhere due to ladders. I could see the bigger kids having fun in there. For the most part, the area was tidy. There`s is wear and tear in some areas but that`s a given since children can be wild animals at time.   I really liked the arcade area! Nice selection on games! I just got the $5 card for 20 credits which came out to $6 (new card). We played about 5-6 games w that.   It`s a little too scary for me to go back w my 2yr old. He wants to venture out and do the bigger kid activities but not best for me. Way too much work! Maybe if you have an older sibling that can chase after your little one for you."<11<12<2019<3<40<5

He did not show up then either. I know there are scheduling problems, but he didn`t call, I did. He promised a 3rd date. He didn`t show, 3 strikes and you`re out. I asked for a refund and he promised one. I then looked at my credit card statement, he had charged me twice! WOW! I disputed both of course and will wait to see what becomes of this.  I forgot to mention he missed the first appointment to do the estimate, just the estimate, not the work. That was my first clue, right? I should have known better.

The customer service is so bad.  The ticket agents and boarding agents have such poor attitude towards customers and speak so aggressively to them. I watched as customer after customer was spoken to in an extremely rude manner. Not one customer was rude or obnoxious. They were just asking a question   I asked a question why I was boarding group 8. When I purchased the ticket on their card. Told I was not the main card holder. Then asked how I could get a higher boarding category as I was curious. The answer pay for it.   Then at the ticketing desk they were calling for people to check their bags through to final destination. I went to the desk and told them I would be happy to gate check and pick up when the plane landed. I am traveling internationally and I did not want to pick up in LA and have to go through security all over again. Who likes standing in the TSA lines?   Not me !   The response to my request was that they would take my bag and check it all the way through to my final destination. I was trying to be the nice person   When I explained that I have done   that in the past they called me a liar and told me that would never happen.   Well it has happened in the recent past  Lucky for me I had a back pack in my carryon bag.  I had to empty my bag and put it into the small back pack as they literally took my carry on bag from. Me.  I did this prior to standing in the line as I knew that it would. Happen if I had not I would not have had the opportunity to do that as my bags was taken from me.   I boarded the plane and  witnessed people with three bags stowing them under the seats and and in the over head bins.   The attitude towards customers is so bad and the aggressive manner of the workers is shocking. The disdain that is displayed towards customers shocked me.   As consumers we read about aggressive travelers but I think the looking glass should be turned to the employees.  It is frustrating to be a traveler/customer and know that there is nothing you can do and that employees have all the power.<19<4<2018<0<3<33
xAUIK__r2JWzBrMX1JKAxg<0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w<anDTChqnPQ4r6WLPuKBA1w<3<10<4<9<"Prometric Testing Center tests how long you can sit in a room without a beverage, smart phone, companionship, music, or possessions while under the eyes of an examiner. This is the secondary test to the tests that the  Prometric Testing Center administers. This is one of the testing centers in Las Vegas that administers the Praxis Core exams for teacher applicants. In recent times, I spent a Saturday sitting through the three parts of the Praxis Core exam: reading, writing, and math. This would be my closest experience to sitting in jail. After the experience that this review describes I would no longer take my freedom for granted.       The Prometric Testing Center experience started a couple of weeks ahead of physically visiting the office. A couple of weeks prior to the date of the exam, I called up the Praxis number to make an appointment with the Prometric Testing Center. During the phone call, I took care of the payment with my credit card. Applying for the three core exams costed $135 at the time. Fast forward to the test date, all my information was ready.       I recommend getting to the test center early. It blends in with the industrial park in a building at the northwest corner of Valley View at Martin Avenue. There are zero landmarks or characteristics to distinguish it. The best thing I could tell you is that if you are taking an exam here, look for the office in the building facing Shuster Street.      During the weeks leading up to the test, I did research. The books hammered it into my head that I would be here a long time. This is not the place that you want to be at thirsty or hungry. I felt that treating myself to a large breakfast ahead of the text was extraordinary beneficial.       Throughout the Praxis Core testing experience, the staff was pleasant at the same time that they were by the books and were not playing games. I would surrender to their authority for a few hours. The Prometric Testing Center was much more thorough than the TSA inspections at the airport.       After filling out the paperwork, I relinquished my smartphone, watch, pen, and everything except my clothes. All my possessions would go into a locker. Then they did the rub down process to make sure I was not sneaking anything into the test center proper. The next order of business was when they walked me into the testing room. They locked the door. It was only me, a computer, scrap paper pamphlet, pencil, and my brains. This test center is so by the books that I would have to turn in the scrap paper. At the time of the three separate core exams-each timed with a window on the monitor counting down the seconds-an examiner would be watching me through the window. If it was necessary to use the restroom, I would have to communicate by raising my hand.       The testing itself was state-of-the-art. I actually enjoy this, actually a better word is '"tolerate'" this more than the CAT tests I took in school. As a test taker, I appreciated the ability to go back and forth between the questions and review them without a pencil and eraser. The math section also included a calculator window.      When I felt that I was done with the test, I hit '"submit'"  on the computer and raised my hand. Between the three core exams, there was a small break. I would have to go through the exact procedure to get back inside the computer room.     Following the conclusion of the exam, the staff was pleasant and let me know that the scores would soon be available.     In retrospect, I understand that Prometric Testing has two customers with customer one being me-the test taker and customer two being the Board of Education. When writing this review, I understand that Prometric Testing Center has a binding contract with the Board of Education to guarantee that there is zero unethical behavior going on such as cheating. My test taking here is evidence that Prometric Testing Center is doing a satisfactory job administering the Praxis Core exam. If only my math comprehension was at the same level as their exam administration, I wouldn`t have to return to additional quasi-jail time to retake the math core."<4<4<2016<3<18<51

Yikes!!   My partner and I both took our 17 month old today and it was PURE STRESS! This place was full of very poorly behaved, aggressive 8-10 year olds and even with two parents with our daughter constantly, she got hurt every 3 minutes by someone mowing her down. These big kids kept pushing each other on the push cars in a full-on sprint, and one of them would have seriously injured my kid if I hadn`t picked her up really quickly or put my foot out to stop her from getting slammed by one of these cars the entire time she was in any open space. They ended up smashing into my shins, which are now black & blue.   We spent a full hour basically just yelling at other people`s kids while their parents sat on their cellphones. And we weren`t the only ones...pretty much all the parents of little kids were in the same boat. One dad was absolutely heated, screaming at a group of older kids who were plowing his young daughter from both directions on the slide while she was stuck inside bawling.    There was a toddler area, but it wasn`t enforced so it was still full of big kids slamming into the little ones. Even in the baby area, there were big kids picking up and throwing the see-saw and trampling everyone.   Just a warning to you all. There is zero employee supervision or enforced rules. It`s a complete free-for-all and this place is probably only beneficial if you`re the parent of an 8-10 year old who`s going to be on the '"top of the food chain'".  10/10 will not return to this place until summer is over, on a weekday, when all the little jerks are back in school."<28<7<2018<20<41<3

I`ve lived in the area for 17 years and never noticed them in this little strip.  So much closer and convenient to home!! The owner asked me how I heard about them. She also asked where I usually go for service, and I shared with her the convenience of my last place and that I liked the people but the shape, cut and quality was becoming hit or miss for a SNS or gel mani/pedi, and for the price it was time to try a new business. I made an appointment and the lady called me by name when I walked in, and thanked me by name when I left.  Wow, it felt like a big hug!  That was so nice and so easy to share her appreciation. They have lots of gel and SNS colors.  There are a line of chairs on right side and a line of shelves on the opposite wall with all the colors. The massage chairs are nice and even the seat hugged me.  I`ve had been to one place that had this type of chair.  It felt so good.   There were two attendants and the lady who welcomed me removed the gel then another lady did the service. Regretfully, I have forgotten their names but will have to be sure I ask next time. Eeeeek...How horrible of me. I will ask on my next visit and update.  (I had a lot on my mind and it`s unlike me to forget names.)  What is IMPORTANT is that she did a GREAT job.  I`m picky about the length and shape of my nails.  I don`t want them long, yet not short AND they are all the same length.  Somehow this seems to be difficult for some technicians which is why I left the last 2 places.  The tech was not happy with the gel on my left big toe and she completely redid it.  Such attention to detail and quality.  Things to note: Bring cash for tip! Gel pedi and soak $45 without tip. Busiest are weekdays in morning and after 4:00.

However, it just wasn`t for our pup. He`s a 9 month old Labrador with lots and lots of puppy energy so he didn`t do too well at this facility. The first time we sent him for a 2 hour trial run of day care he spent most of his time in the break section because he was doing too many zoomies and was so excited that he made the other dogs get too excited. I think his energy was too much for the other dogs.   I`d suggest this facility for anyone who has maybe a slower paced dog or an older dog who isn`t as rambunctious.   I was a little bummed that he wasn`t able to run all out like he wanted but that`s okay! We will just try to find somewhere geared toward more outside playtime. It`s just the process, some dogs do well other places while others do not.   Thanks for giving us the opportunity anyway!<16<7<2019<19<4<44

My suggestion is to put your name down for a table (they don`t take reservations ahead of time), walk around the corner to the Blacksmith Cafe for pre-brunch/coffee/biscuits, or just anywhere else in the general area, while you wait for Snooze to text you that your table is ready.  They let people wait inside and by the bar, but there are so many people waiting there`s no room; I waited in line at the bar and never got to the front; they have a small space outside with games as well, but I couldn`t bear it in the Houston heat. Another suggestion is to get a side of rocks with your mimosas, or other drinks - ours ended up at the table close to room temperature.  The food itself, as well as the drinks even at room temperature, was seriously delicious and lived up to the hype, and while its probably worth a wait, it was not exactly worth my wait on a weekend - an hour and a half before being seated, and another hour after that before we got our food.  The staff was pleasant, despite the amount of customers they had to serve, and apologetic about the wait for the food.<24<10<2017<3<52<45

We also both got the Snooze Hot chocolate and a chai.  All of the options were incredible, and I love that we got to make our own little sampler. The staff was very friendly and helpful as well.

The cashier asked me something that I didn`t quite hear so I responded with a friendly '"pardon?'", she got very rude as if I offended her by asking her to repeat herself and proceeded to yell what she had previously said. Did not appreciate her unnecessary attitude.   Other than the impolite cashier, the lychee bubble tea was delicious. The tapioca balls tasted fresh. I payed about $7.50.

I considered rhinoplasty for about 15 years and finally got the guts to go into a consultation two months before my wedding.   After meeting him, I didn`t even want to talk to another surgeon. I trusted him immediately because I could see that he was a lot like me... a perfectionist. It was obvious that he knew exactly what he was doing - I didn`t even say a word about why I hated my nose - he was able to point out every part of it that I didn`t like, while telling me what he would do to change it. He radiates so much passion that it even made me excited about noses too!   The morning of my surgery, I was super nervous. Dr. Hobgood came in smiling and told me that he looked at my file for a long time the night before and was thinking about my nose the whole drive to the surgery center. This was a pretty big surgery because of all the little quirks and complications my nose had to offer.  When I got home post-op, I looked in the mirror and freaked out because it seemed really upturned. I called him and he reassured me that this was normal - it was called a '"nose bra'" and not to worry (I`m a worrier/control freak, but I decided to trust him and try to be patient). Everything ended up going down just as he said it would. He spent actual time talking to me like a good friend would do, and told me to call him any time if I needed anything. So cool.  My wedding is now in 9 days and I couldn`t be happier. I know that I will love my pictures and exude the confidence that I was meant to always have. I fall more in love with my new nose every day, and thank Dr. Hobgood every day, even though he can`t hear me! Thank you, Dr. Hobgood, for being you. You have changed my life and I could never thank you enough. You are wonderful."<23<12<2016<0<8<1

And it`s unfortunate that lots like this don`t Rectify issues as indicated.   Buyer be careful while they have a fantastic first time buyers program you get what you paid. Jesse the technician in the service department repeatedly gives us the runaround.   The service manager never calls back and the finance lady Shakira or Shinarmar has the worst attitude ever. In fact after numerous text messages indicating that she did not receive the down payment in which she did and instead of researching it and coming back to issue after readearching it  in a respectful manner she negated and argued it for over 30 minutes and continue to send Confrontational  text messages and reverted to calling personally and threatening -all of which was recorded. When asked to no longer text she then threatened to repossess the vehicle because we wanted to opt out of receiving text messages?  Yet we provided an alternate phone number for her to contact .  completely unacceptable a unfortunate.   Bob our sales agent was incredible on the initial visit  but this had turned into something absolutely ridiculous based on issues with the vehicle they sold and their accounting corporate office , payment clerk being and the inability to audit Accra correctly. # behumble.<12<12<2017<0<53<15

We love Indian food, and we always order the same things: Saag Paneer for him, Paneer Masala (which has a variety of names depending on the restaurant -- here it was Shaahi Paneer) for me, plus shared naan and raita.   The ONLY items we found acceptable were the naan and the basmati rice. The raita was so full of onions that I couldn`t eat it. My husband agreed that it was too onion-y, and it was also full of tomatoes, which he despises. What it didn`t seem to have any of was cucumbers, which is supposed to be the main ingredient in raita (other than the obvious yogurt base). My Shaahi Paneer *literally* tasted like Campbell`s canned tomato soup with some pieces of flavorless paneer thrown in. My husband`s Saag Paneer was hot (spicy) but without much flavor otherwise.   This was our first and LAST experience with Jewel of the Crown.

The board also decided to file a claim against Dr. Clinton based on both of their testimonies. My dog was diagnosed as diabetic Memorial Day weekend and was dead right after Labor Day. I went in almost every week to get his blood tested and it wasn`t until I finally took him to another vet that I found out how many basic things these two vets didn`t check which could have been easily solved.

My order delivery instructions were a little different, so they contacted me to clarify before delivery which was great!   I love that they are all local Ontario Flowers.  I also love that they send you a photo of the bouquet that went out! Such a nice touch!<3<8<2016<13<35<24

My doctor referred me to this company because of my insurance but if you have any choice in going to a sleep facility don`t choose this one.   It`s very very very difficult to get hold of a live person via phone. Be prepared to have to call multiple times, to be put on extended holds and to be blindly transferred to voicemails ( that no one ever returns). Monica, in particular, is extremely unpleasant. You can expect to ask for a manager to call you back and to not get a call back. The sleep rooms are basic, at best. The bed I slept in was concave in the middle.  It took 15 -  20 attempted phone calls to actually be able to schedule my follow up. I was put on hold for over 15 minutes at a time. When I was actually able to speak to a live person they would abruptly put me on hold ( even if I said I couldn`t hold). I even asked when was the best time to call so I wouldn`t have to hold but I got no answer and was just put on hold or transferred to voicemail.  There were a few positives. Brenda, who answers the phones must be the only nice person on the phones. Dr. Tara was knowledgeable and genuine but every time I expressed my dissatisfaction with the hold times,etc  not one person offered an apology or any type of empathy. In fact one of the employees told me that she is also frustrated with the company and many of the patients complain about the lack of customer service. It seems that the owners could care less about the patient experience. That comes from the top down. So if you are the Owner(s) and you are reading this: You are FAILING to properly train your staff and it`s obvious you are short staffed and they don`t have enough resources to do their jobs efficiently. (My doctor stated that she was unable to print out some recommendations for me since she didn`t have access to a printer). The patient experience with this company is just plain awful. There are a few nice employees but most of them could use some serious customer service training but like I said it starts at the top.<5<7<2019<23<8<49

Located at Town Square and opened for lunch, makes it the perfect place to eat at when shopping. The setting is romantic and the noise level is very low. The perfect spot to meet up with that special someone or your bestest of friends.   The fish taste fresh and the presentation of the dishes are top notch. Prices are reasonable  and portions are relatively big. You feel like you are getting your money worth. Everytime we have are here we were greeted and waited on with a warm aloha and quick and friendly service. Yes, I said aloha because everytime we eat here, the wait help is always from Hawaii!

I`ve had a lot of work done without issues and now I have braces by them. I have dental insurance as well and it`s been really affordable. My husband also comes here and he`s had no complaints. Only reason I won`t give a 5 star review would be because recently at my adjustments I`ve had 2 problems. One of them the person adjusting them gave me the wrong elastic pattern which has delayed my treatment plan. And recently the person doing my adjustment was probably new and had a lot of issues getting my closed coil put in and had to ask for help after several painful attempts. Not only that but when they put my wires in they didn`t bother to cut them down until they got help from another person and the first thing she did was cut the wires back before proceeding! I know they constantly have new employees which is fine, but I`d wish they would have another person double check their work to avoid small issues like these. Otherwise I haven`t had any issues. Staff is friendly, wait times are short, rooms are clean, and it`s affordable.<1<12<2019<17<29<25

The customer service here is terrible, the testers are a mess, and the manager are absolutely rude they will not go above and beyond for their loyal customers. Heres my story, i went in tonight to grab a couple bottles of wella shampoo and conditioner ( my go to when i can`t get to my stylist to grab R & co) , i had a 20% off coupon and those always burn a hole in pocket. I went in and noticed the sign said wella entire line buy 2 for $22 dollars score! I thought i scoped the fragrance out because not only do i love makeup but fragrance.. I`m finally at check out and notice the shampoo and conditioner didn`t apply the discount, the original cashier was snarky she was a blonde gal and said yeah it doesn`t apply to this size but it`s weird it let me do it earlier, so i said umm ok so i go to look for smaller bottles, didn`t find any asked if they had any in the back, nope, that`s fine we`ll if it worked earlier and it`s not in stock how about go above and beyond to help with the issue and ask if we could do an override, nope, so I`m sol and there`s no other options being given to me, i then ask about the $15 coupon be added to my purchase for the inconvenience I`ve experience, the 2nd cashier calls for a manager and she says no and that she`ll be out so 10 mins later manager duanna comes out with a less than pleased look on her face to have to come to the front and help the 2nd cashier who has no idea how to apply a coupon (not her fault she was very nice) so she puts in some number walks away when there other customers in line waiting and we run into another issue, the manager is snarky and says she`s dealing with a customer... at this point I`m frustrated because a 3rd cashier comes by fixes the issue and then says the 20% took off 12$ and the $15 dollar off coupon doesn`t apply to fragrance, i then say you know what forget this item I`ll just take the other items and get out of here because clearly i just wasted an hour of my time and my what would have been over $200 dollar purchase turned to $43 and a lost customer... i was in retail for 12 yrs, I`ve gone above and beyond for customers my whole career, till the end last year... i had actually considered making Ulta my main store to purchase as opposed to Sephora now I`ll never give that store my business and will be telling my friends and family in the neighborhood to stay away... at least Sephora GOES above and beyond for their customers... consumers beware<18<12<2018<1<25<23

The only problem I have with the community is that there are lots of dogs and very few owners who are cleaning up after them. You will learn very quickly not to walk in the grass unless you want to walk back to clean your shoes, I asked the office about adding signs and/or providing baggies and trash cans in the grassy areas, they said they would pass it onto the higher ups but a year later the problem is the same.  The apartments themselves aren`t terrible but noticeably aged, my kitchen light doesn`t turn on half the time I flip the switch, sometimes I`ll flip it on and it will turn on 15 minutes later, there are also a couple outlets that don`t work unless you wiggle the cord right. The hot water in my single apartment is enough for a 3 minute hot shower, and the faucet drips regardless of how far the nob is turned. My A/C has broke twice in a year, and the water has also been shut off during the day, no exaggeration, atleast 25 times for maintenance in the last year. The buildings internet also went out and was 3 weeks of repeated calling to the office and spectrum to finally get them to fix the wiring to the building for it. There are a considerable number of cockroaches compared to other places I have stayed, but it may in part be because I am on the ground floor.  My real issue is with management who has time and time again proven that they don`t care about any of these issues. When they say they will fix a problem, that means call every day and maybe they`ll eventually fix it, they may also just tell you that you signed the lease and they can`t do anything about it. They also took away the valet trash for my building half way through my lease with no written explanation, and when they posted the prices for lease renewals, they said that they made a mistake and gave out new ones the next day that were $50-$100/month greater than the ones the day before (which were still higher than when I signed my lease).  If you are looking here because of the low prices, there is a reason (many actually) for it and I would highly recommend paying a little more for something a lot better.<26<11<2019<23<27<24

I ordered the New England clam chowder. While it didn`t fully taste like clam chowder it had an excellent flavor. You could taste the clams, and there was a good number of clams in the soup, but is had more of a potato chowder flavor...an excellent potato chowder mind you!  The Irish stew was phenomenal. The roast melted in your mouth. The potatoes, carrots, and onions were flavorful. The gravy was simply divine. This alone is bringing me back!  My partners Irish Breakfast was complete, ample and very flavorful. See photos.  No restaurant is perfect. If there was to be a demerit given it would be the lack of light in the place. It was difficult to read the menus. The décor was appropriate and appreciated but it just dampened the light."<12<5<2019<23<54<32

I had cocktail #5 and it was delicious. There were four of us and we each order two options and shared them all. I had a heavy lunch a few hours before and my husband had some chicken just in case there wasn`t enough food and I do think that was the right call. He eats a lot so it made sense for him to eat some before.  I loved the apricot hummus, wanted to drink the sauce from the shrimp and the smoked octopus had great flavor. The Brussels sprouts were cooked well, the rice was flavorful and surprising as we didn`t expect much from '"just rice'". The kafta was really flavorful and the lamb cooked well.  The restaurant itself has clean lines and overall very pleasing. I loved the matte black faucet in the bathroom (do I notice this because I`m going through a kitchen Reno??

I live on the course so this review isn`t based on a single visit. Beautiful grounds but overpriced restaurants with less than average food. This is huge because you`re a 5 minute Uber from some of the best restaurants in the entire state. Also the newly remodeled golf course is terrible looking. And by terrible I mean there`s dead and yellow grass in multiple places all the time. Wet spots are common, and greens are brown in areas. It`s just not a 5 star place by any standards. Who`s ever in charge of this place needs to rethink operations and quality. Especially since there are so many resort and golf options in the area that are way better.<10<8<2019<4<43<32

If you come M-Thursday its $15 which is a pretty solid deal. The steak and shrimp fajitas were pretty good, I also liked the salmon and enchiladas. I do wish they had some tortillas though so you could wrap up the fajitas. Theres a few carving stations as well with different meats.  I finished off my meal at the dessert station. The cake slices I tried (cheesecake, tiramisu) seemed like they had been sitting out for a little and weren`t that great. The gelato was awesome though. The mango and lemon flavors were my favorite.  Got a few plates in then hit the tables to win back what I just spent on lunch! What a win-win! Will be back again to try the dinner buffet.<27<4<2017<15<38<38

I called while I was in the parking lot to make sure that there bakery was still open because it was 8:30 p.m. They said that they were. Then when I walked in I noticed that the bakery was closed because they were remodeling.  They could have told me that when I called them!  I confirmed with a guy that worked there that they were closed, but he was nice.  He said what are you looking for maybe they have something in the back.  I told him that I just wanted a couple fo pieces of Tres Leche.  He went to the counter and spoke with the ladies behind there.  He came back and said '"Yes'", they can help you with that.  Then I appeared and said hello to them and they looked at me and said '"NO'" and began to speak Spanish to the guy that originally helped me.  He then turned to me and said '"They don`t have Tres Leche'".  Hmmmmmmmm, what`s wrong with that picture?  I rarely come in there, when I do it`s to pickup a desert or two which isn`t often.

The two women at the hostess stand ignored us for several minutes while they were having a personal conversation.  Once they acknowledged us, they acted as if we were bothering them and totally had attitudes. We got seated and it took forever for our server to come over.

We went almost a week ago and wasn`t sure to expect. The photos looked great, there wasn`t much ratings but they were high. Its close to the firehouse subs right down the street from the house. Good parking because it`s a strip mall and walked in and felt the vibe. Nice modern decor with booths to the right tables in the middle and a long bench for tables on the left. Wasn`t busy only a few other tables. Server greeted us and even tho we didn`t catch her name, her service was amazing. I ordered a coffee and my girl just had a water. I was impressed already by the choice of music which was like a jazzy lounge feel. The coffee was some real gourmet shit. Lol. We ordered and took some baby back ribs and kampachi as suggested from our server. My god. The ribs came with some radish in little cubes and we were told to cut little pieces to balance the ribs out. Great attention to detail and serving size to each bite was perfect. The kampachi has little clear caviar and Soranos on them. My girlfriend doesn`t eat anything raw but she ate half of it and really enjoyed it. I did too. Chef Kyoung came out and talked to us and explained the dishes which I felt like I was Anthony Bourdain or something. He was also owner and you can tell this place is what happens when someone is really passionate about what they do and the attention to detail is phenomenal. We also split the short rib at the end which is baked for like 24 hours or something and it shows. Falling off the rib so tender. So soft. Damn it was bomb!!! It came with these little rice cakes that were rolled with bacon. Wtf?? Never knew I needed that in my life. Bomb... with little carrots. We should have ordered two. One for each of us. Rarely I eat dessert because I don`t have much of a sweet tooth. But damn.. so far how it was going. We had to, cmon. I was already blown away.

Needless to say, I love it here.  I always sit at the bar and the service is always excellent! All of the bartenders that I`ve come across are always super friendly and attentive.  The interior of this place is cool and funky! There`s all these different artifacts and flags throughout the entire building.  This is certainly a great place to come if you ever want some good noms and good entertainment!  I`ve tried practically everything on the menu, too! However, I always (and I mean always) order the peach ale.  Last night`s batch was EXTRA peachy - why can`t it always taste that peachy?! It was delicious! Too bad it was a Sunday night...  For apps, I highly recommend the brickhouse wings and chicken rolls.  The poutine is OK.  For those who are picky about their fries (me!), this poutine dish has wide, flat fries.  Awesome flavor, but the texture was meh.  For entrees, I`m all about their Caesar salad, green chile mac & cheese, and abe froman pizza. Unfortunately, I haven`t tried any of their desserts - but that`s because their entrees are always so freaking huge! Definitely shareable dishes. Also, Four Peaks is especially great because they have the ARIZONA GUNSLINGER HOT SAUCE.  I`ve gone to 4-5 different grocery stores in search of this sauce and still haven`t found it.  And after asking one of the servers last night where I could get it, he asked his managers and said, '"the store.'"  Ummm so if anyone knows where I can find this sauce, PLEASE LET ME KNOW! I really don`t want to drive out to Mesa to get it and I certainly don`t want to order it from online.  Lastly, parking can be a bit of a challenge so I`d definitely recommend showing up a little early.  And ladies - have your ID ready to go.  You don`t wanna be THAT girl that holds up the line because you`re digging through your Mary Poppins bag looking for your wallet (been there, done that...numerous times)."<4<6<2018<16<18<42

This place has most of the same dishes as their sister store and a whole lot more! They have dim sum (I haven`t tried it yet) and your typical Cantonese dishes - with fresh live seafood.  I`ve been here twice - both for dinner and have had similar experiences. The restaurant itself is beautiful and quite large.  They have several tanks with live seafood over in the corner and a couple different dining rooms. The bathrooms are clean and modern, which is unfortunately not very common for most Chinese restaurants.  I was fortunate enough to be able to eat lobster here on both visits and I can say that they sure as hell know how to cook a lobster! It was cooked to perfection both times - stab the meat and twist - falls right off.  I find myself having to fight the meat off the shell in most places but not the case here.  If you want it legit asian style - ask for it to be cooked with ginger and onion and if you`re extra hungry - you can ask them to add noodles to it. They cook the noodles in the same delicious lobster sauce as your entree - it`s a pretty awesome experience.  Most lobsters weigh in at about 3 lbs or so - they charge by weight, comes out to about $23/lb.  Both times for dinner they gave us some complimentary soup to start, which is pretty typical in more upscale Chinese restaurants.  It doesn`t hurt to ask if they have some if they don`t just bring it out to you. I was also able to try a cold appetizer pork shank - which was a first for me.  Usually most places only have beef shank.  The pork was good - it was different - it`s almost like eating a cold cut meat.  The outside texture was gelatinous and the inside had a smokey / salami type spice to it.  It was served on a bed of pickled vegetables which gave it a different dimension.  Also ordered a pork clay pot dish (sorry don`t remember the exact name) but it has some melt in your mouth pork sandwiched with some crumbly taro - it was full of umami, savory goodness.  Presentation was awesome - it came out on a silver platter (literally) and even had a chafing flame under it to keep it hot.  Order this dish and eat it with some white rice - pure heaven.  If you like duck - order a duck or at least a half duck - it is one of their specialties after all.  You can even get one to go if you`re in a hurry. It is one of their specialties after all.  If this place was some awesome, why the 4 star? Well, the food was amazing - however the service could use a little work.  It seems like they don`t really have assigned tables and everyone is kind of just all over the place.  They`re not the most efficient / organized when it gets busy - they could use some extra help. Don`t expect any small talk from these servers as they are always busy and don`t be shy about flagging someone down to get service and you`ll have a great meal."<11<2<2019<9<55<27

Ownership change but the foods still similar, dumplings, noodles, cold dishes, tastes pretty much on par.  Major difference was certain things got inflated, not good things, like balloons say for example.   Maybe they got a better marketing company too now that they do seem to be doing a bit better.  Anyway, foods still ok, but the quality and quantity doesn`t match what you get so there`s much better Chinese food places out there.<9<11<2019<2<48<10

It was easy to get reservations for lunch at 12:30 through the Yelp App.   The location is on West Sahara.  It`s a short Uber drive from the strip for visitors and locals, you know how to get there. The staff was friendly.  They gave us the booth we wanted after turning down their first offer of a smaller one. I had the BLT with fries.  Like everything there, the sandwich was HUGE.  Plenty, Plenty flavorful bacon fresh lettuce and tomato.  The only drawback was too much bread.  The bread was way too thick for the sandwich.  With a little bit of trouble I enjoyed the sandwich.  The fries were good.  They seemed fresh made. The star of the lunch was the mac and cheese with bacon.  Man that was good.  Next time a large portion of that to share with a salad each would do the trick for a nice lunch. The red velvet waffle for desert was ok.  I wish they had a larger desert selection. It`s tucked away on the gigantic menu like an after thought. Service was nice, friendly, prompt and efficient. I`ll be back!<10<11<2019<20<22<4

The tots tasted more like sour cream and chive tots than sharp cheddar, which was still good. I could only eat a few though because they were pretty rich. Also their menu on the Aria website is outdated. I`ll probably stick with Eggslut (@ the Cosmopolitan) for breakfast sandwiches because it`s cheaper and tastier, and they allow substitutions.<15<11<2019<20<57<6

Visiting from NYC Manhattan I was looking forward to nice Italian food for dinner.  My friend who is a local took me as he very quickly got embarrassed at the lack of warm hospitality as we both sat in a booth for 15 min with not 1 waiter to welcome us.  My friend and I are both GAY and I Believe we were discriminated against because of this.  I called the restaurant to express my anger and the woman only expressed sarcastic sympathy.

I can not get them to fix my leak correctly.  I wish I was never referred to this company. I`ve lost wages from missing work, been unable to sleep and I regret ever calling them out.

In town for business and this is easily within the Top 5 meals of my life...I can`t even remember one that tops it at the moment.   I started out with the Burton`s Old-Fashioned which was perfect... great taste, yet strong.   But as good as the drinks are, it is the food that steals the show.   I ordered the Crab-Encrusted Haddock and added the mushrooms & onions as the side. What I didn`t expect was that the mushrooms and onions would be layered on top of the jasmine rice.   The combination of all of the flavors... the haddock, the crab, the mushrooms, onions, rice and then the superb lemon butter sauce that encircles the edge of the plate... simply sublime!   Everything was prepared perfectly and I can`t sing its praises enough!   If you`re in Charlotte, I beg of you to go to Burton`s and try this dish! I promise you won`t regret it!<20<11<2019<1<33<57

On the plus side the young lady behind the counter told him he had to take the dog outside. I didn`t buy the cake I thought it was to expensive.

I didn`t think I would even write it but someone has to in the name of being helpful.  The people who will read this review are on their search of a place to bring friends and family together to celebrate the life of someone they have lost. It`s a painful time and you want everything to go smoothly. The folks at Simple Alternative were more than kind, they were real. They are very accommodating in every way possible. It`s a tough circumstance for everyone so the last thing you need is any extra grief.  The rooms were perfect for the gatherings we had. Tables for food and flowers and a digital screen for sharing old photographs that make you both smile and cry, sometimes at the same time. This is an intimate, warm space.  They even let us into the kitchen, for private conversations. I`ll never forget it.   I recommend this place for non denominational services.   I wish peace to anyone reading this.<6<1<2012<22<18<23

I`ve been here twice and I`ve gotten the prix fixe for two both times. It`s great value for an appetizer, meat platter, and dessert. I honestly split the two person portion with three people and we were quite full.   To start, I had the scallops, which were cooked very well. It`s a bit pricey if you just order it on its own, but when are scallops not expensive? For the main, I`ve only had the cote de boeuf from here, but the meat is cooked to perfection and the fries and ratatouille pair incredibly well with the rich meal. For dessert, I can`t recommend the creme brûlée enough. Get it. Get two servings because you won`t want to share. It`s so good I didn`t even stop to take a photo.   Despite how good the food was, I had to dock a star for the service. A bit on the slow end, but don`t let that deter you from coming here. It`s hard to be perfect!<12<11<2019<3<27<26

It`s always chaotic at the beginning and tough to get into corrals. But since the races are chip timed, not clock timed, this isn`t a big deal.  All runners are responsible for knowing the course and following along. Study the route and you`ll be ok.   A couple of dings: The full is definitely an afterthought. 3.5 miles of weaving through a parking lot isn`t awesome. The half is well planned and a fun Strip-based route. The run-through wedding is best pitched for half marathon participants only. If a full runner wants to do the wedding, they need to do sub-8 min miles to get back on course with the cut off times allowed.  Otherwise, great race. It was a challenge for me since it was at night and in a dry climate. Two things I`m not used to! But I had a great time and enjoyed pushing myself.<18<11<2019<19<11<54

Also, purchasing the protection plan for all the items purchased. One of the purchases being my husband`s wedding band. On the day before our honeymoon, my husband stopped by to have his wedding band cleaned, during cleaning the associate knocked a diamond out. The Associate named Erin offered to send it out to be fix. However, that would not be doing us a favor as we have already paid for the protection plan for this ring which would cover the damage she caused.   In order to fix the ring, the ring would have to be sent out to be replaced which would take 2-4 weeks. Again, this is the day before flying out to our honeymoon, so obviously we do not have time to wait for it to come back.    Erin never apologized nor asked if there was anything she could do for our inconvenience. Instead, she gave us a the customer service number. I called only to realize it was Saturday and the office was closed. At this point we were desperate. We were willing to increase our line of credit in order to not leave there with a ring for my husband, but of course they did not have any ring the would fit his ring in the display. He wears a size 12.  We just decided to take the ring with the missing diamond and deal with it once we came back from our honeymoon. Once we arrived back in the states we took the ring to be sent in for repairs and contact customer service to make them aware of our issue. We were told Abby Monti the district manager would give me call, she never did.  Now a 3 months later we were back for the same ring missing the same diamond. This time the told us it would take 4-6 weeks to be repaired. At this point who wants a ring they continuously need to get repaired. We called customer service again and they told us Abby Monti would contact us back and we have heard nothing!!!!   Overall, its a shame we have been a long standing customer and have to go through such terrible customer service.<26<11<2019<20<10<29

However, this location just doesn`t impress me.  :(  Today a few coworkers and I went at lunch and 1 person was working the line. It took way longer than it needed too. The cashier was also making us wait to pay while she went back and forth from cleaning the lobby. I feel like that can wait and always should drop what you`re doing to take care of the costumer or at least kindly say you`ll be right with us.  The food however is worth it!

My fiancé and I have now been here twice, both times with the same waiter. I gave them the benefit of the doubt since we came on opening week but now there`s no excuse for the service we received. My fiancé`s empty cup was sitting in front of her for 20 minutes before I had to ask a waiter that wasn`t even ours to please refill her drink. After our food was thrown on the table we asked for more napkins for our meal. I wish I would have taken a picture of my hand and all the food on it since I had to use it for a napkin because the ones we asked for never showed up! Why this is such a disappointment is because I have such high expectations not only because I`m in the service industry but I grew up with such a fond memory of a restaurant that felt like home. I guess the customer service got closed down with the old Macayos.<9<11<2019<4<32<16

I`ve been the location in Denver and was so excited to hear there was one opening up in Houston! Service: very friendly waiters and hostess, always dancing or have a smile on their face.. Makes you want to dance and smile along with them! We made reservation for this soft opening for 11am, and got seating by 11:25am. The place was packed and they haven`t even officially open yet!  Ambiance: so colorful with great bright colors to wake you up and get excited for the amazing brunch. More hidden seating in the back room which you don`t initially see once walking in. There are seats at the bar and also circle booths in the main room.  The OMG! French Toast and breakfast pot pie is a must try!! The pretzel bun on the breakfast sandwich was so soft and fluffy. Everything was delicious and just like how it was in Denver.  This soft opening was to celebrate with their partner Heroes for Children. All the food and non-alcoholic drinks (grapefruit juice was very refreshing) were all complimentary. I of course, tip the friendly waitress and donated to the important cause!  I will definitely be back to try the pancake flight! Their special banana pudding pancake (not pictured) batter was to die for.

To be fair it might have just been our server. Everyone else there seemed more than willing to help, but they weren`t our server. So as we got sat we get a server that barely speaks English (yes I know we`re at a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown) however the first thing she says to us '"no one speak Chinese?'" I maybe Asian looking but everyone else I was with did not and obviously we didn`t. But her English was soo limited basically point at the menu. Usually I don`t mind this but she didn`t even do her basic job of getting us water/drinks. We had to flag someone down for that one. By the time we got our drinks we were done with the food and everyone was thirsty AF. It`s 110 degrees out. Just unacceptable. Then again we had to waive someone else down to order RICE, yes rice. All the entrees came out and no rice pot. Wth?! Then every time we tried to tell her something she would so '"ok'" but we don`t see her for 15mins but she`s back there at the waiter station not '"waiting'" on anyone! Even the tables next to us, waited forever just to order food. I`m giving 2 stars for the other 2 waiters who had to pick up the slack, and we could see them getting upset with her as they literally did everything for her. Maybe she`s new?! Idk just wasn`t a good experience that I wouldn`t go back but to get take out."<1<9<2019<22<18<0

I`m not a big fan of going to breakfast places when I tend to get disappointed if they can`t deliver a nice extra large iced latte! However, BC did not disappoint!

Shawn was great in setting up the time and notifying us the cleaner was on the way. When she arrived, she was very kind and went through the home as we showed her what we wanted for the deep clean of moving into a new home. When she left we were happy with the look of the home. Later that evening we noticed the inside of the oven had not been touched, which was one of the main items we requested, as all major appliances had been used by the previous owner. I wrote Shawn a text but had not received a response back yet. This morning when everything was in the light of day, we realized none of the baseboards were cleaned and the shower and bathtub still had dust inside. We can run our hand along the tub and it covers the fingertips. This was a large sum of money to pay for someone to have done a very basic cleaning job.

I`m not really a fast food place, but this place sent a coupon to my parents - so we went to try them out.   We tried the California burger and the double with cheese and bacon. We also bought three ice creams. The burgers looked greasy, like you would expect from a diner - but I was blown away by the flavor it had in both sandwiches. They serve this with horseshoe fries and have multitude of dipping sauces from fry sauce, spicy fry sauce, ketchup, mayo, mustard, etc. The fries were crispy and good.   The ice cream was ok. I got vanilla with bananas. They serve them up big! I got a single scoop each for my parents as one likes chocolate and one likes vanilla. They were soooo huge they took them to-go. I was a bit upset that ordering bananas they only cut up five tiny slices on the top of the custard. I thought that couldn`t be - I searched the whole custard in my double scoop serving, but couldn`t find any more bananas. I would suggest lining the cup then adding custard and topping with them when people ask.   Over all I was a fan for the diner. Again diner`s are not my thing, but my parents were really happy to get the coupon supporting veterans, and I enjoyed reading the story of how the owner of the restaurant was a veteran as well! They enjoyed their burgers and fries and they enjoyed the custard. I would def bring my parents back here when I visit for a classic retro diner style lunch/dinner.<3<12<2019<15<40<20

What my disappointment was the services. First, I know there was not a lot of choices on the menu but please do not rush us to make our choice. Then I find the waiter keep on making decision for us, in a negative way. After the main course, we expect to see the dessert menu but they just briefly said  what they have. It wasn`t clear at all. We ended up ordering something. Once the desserts were served, they put our bill immediately on our table without asking. That is so impolite for a restaurant.

I was one of the first members and this place has certainly changed! I wish i could negative stars!  First, be aware of the level of certification your instructor has. They have apprentice instructors teaching all levels without supervision during class. One instance, the instructor asked us to do something I knew was incorrect. Had I done it, I could have easily gotten injured. Pilates takes a long time to learn and these instructors are sped through the program and they don`t share their experience level. That said, many of the long time instructors are great, try to get in their classes.   The biggest problem here-management! It is horrible! The manager is not friendly, customer service focused and will not reply to emails on certain situations that don`t benefit them. They don`t see the big picture that a happy client is a long time client. I am leaving only because of the manager. When I started, it was such a different experience and they would work with you to see what best fits your needs. Customer service now is nonexistent. Totally tuned off all the locations and the franchise because of this. If they treat long time, loyal members this way, how do they get new clients? they are unorganized, rude, and if you bring up an issue be prepared, it`s bad! Many of the first members are long gone.   The convenience was nice but now so not worth it. There are so many great pilates studios in Charlotte which I`ve visited and you will be much better off attending class somewhere else. You will learn more, be safe, and enjoy the experience, which is what pilates is all about. Not whatever this situation has become!<17<11<2019<22<21<41

Picked Grace Point mostly cause it was closest to grandma n lolo`s home. They were very welcoming with lots of greeters. First Lady showed us right over to the kids daycare which was a quick and easy process to get my 6 year old daughter checked in.   Ok, so if you`re anything like me and my wife, it`s a little scary picking out a church to attend in a city that`s not your home without any recommendations. I swear we think the worst and start to worry if we ended up in a place where they bring out the rattlesnakes and start dancing with them. Thank goodness Grace Point was NOT that.   Pastor Ty delivered a scripture based sermon that was consistent with what I felt would be preached at my home church. Love God first even within the covenant of marriage. I liked how they had a specific portion devoted to confession. My wife and I also loved how we were able to receive communion. We will definitely visit them again on our next trip to Vegas.<1<7<2018<18<39<8

I normally always wear gel polish and I came in for a gel manicure. I judge a gel manicure based on how long it lasts (it should be two weeks at least). Well, you`d be surprised how many places will file your nail down to nothing, and then you have polish peeling days later.   Anyway, I had an appointment with Kim and her removal technique was with no discomfort or pain, and minimal nail filing. I was going on vacation and chose a neutral color. Well, I did go on vacation and let me tell you that I was in water the entire time or doing vigorous physical activity and not a single chip or stone fell off. It lasted me three weeks and could have gone longer if it wasn`t for the nail growth.   I went in today and got another gel manicure and look forward to it lasting again.   The location is beautiful, great decor, VERY clean and that`s visible from the moment you walk in the door. You are greeted by usually Riya and/or a gentleman. They have a large color selection for both regular polish and especially gel polish.   Another thing is that you can get really cool nails here. I mean any design you show them can probably be done, nothing tacky either!   Prices are truly fair and for the experience and service you are getting, I would still come here because I leave happy.  Kim is awesome and I enjoy my appointments with her. She is down to earth and very personable.   If you are in need of nail services, don`t go anywhere else!<30<7<2015<0<1<55

I recommend going on week day, or on a Sunday. Saturday`s are a nightmare during the summer months, or during Scarowinds. (Haven`t tried winter fest yet.) aBut I`m sure the crowds will be just as bad. They don`t allow snacks like other theme parks we`ve visited, so you either have to get stamped so you can leave and eat or buy the expensive food inside (which is nothing to brag about) Also, buy the refillable cups, you end up saving more that way.  All in all, it`s a fun theme park for the area, and we might renew our passes for the upcoming season.<13<10<2019<7<28<58

While visiting Las Vegas with my wife I walked into the Pro Shop this past Friday to see if thy could help me with my thumb hole fit. I had developed a callus and needed the thumb hole expanded. They asked to see my ball. We discussed the issue and then they took the ball into the back room and opened the hole a bit. They brought it back and I tried the fit which was still a bit tight. They took the ball back and opened it some more. I tried the fit again and it was perfect. I asked them how much do I owe them and they said nothing and told me to bowl with it and bring it back if I need it opened some more. I bowled with the ball and no more issue with my thumb fit.   Based upon that excellent experience I went back tot he Pro Shop the next day and bought a Ebonite Maxim spare ball and a two ball roller bag. They matched the fit of Maxim with my Storm !Q Tour. They are  great drillers! Great experience again! They will be my go to Pro Shop when I return to Las Vegas.  And the lanes were great too and the lane staff friendly and helpful.<22<10<2019<13<53<43

I will say the mushroom soup is by far one of the best soups I have ever had, not sure if it was the foam or the egg that took it over the top but it was truly a piece of art.

lENA7f_M0Qjcsr7xoQjvJA<sN3VbymeVDybpdxmLIn1PA<j1NXdclbg2svefE0ZhvFjA<1<3<0<0<I have lived right next to God Hands for about a year now. I have always been hesitant to go in because of my texture of my hair, and joy, I should have stayed away. I had made a call ahead to see if they were able to take me in at short noticing, seeing I had an important last-minute event to attend to and just needed a wash and style. The lady who answered said it would be no problem. I arrived 5 minutes later, and as soon a I walked into the door, the woman asked me if my hair was naturally curly, and that I would need to pay double. I had just gotten a hair cut the month3 before, so my hair is in a very stylish asymmetrical cut that is mid-neck length as well treated with an Oleplex and Keratin treatment this past summer, so pretty manageable to work with. I was trying to explain this to her, and she cut me off and told me that I needed to accept the price or was unable to see anyone. I then asked her who my stylist would be and she just repeated that I would need to accept the price. I turned to the four men all on their phones and asked them if they worked here. They all meekly answered yes. THIS should have been my red flag, but I was in a bind and needed to get my hair done quickly. So I told her I accepted the new price ($75.00). I was put with the stylist that spoke the least amount of English and who seemed to be an apprentice. There was NO consultation for what I wanted to do with my hair. I was sent to the sink, and given a wash (which I will actually commend. That gentleman did a great job).   I was put back into the chair with the apprentice, who asked me if it was okay if he used a hair straightener. I said yes. As he was blow drying my hair I could see the employees making faces at each other and rolling their eyes. He seemed afraid to touch my hair. He came of the front of my hair, which is growing in from a partially shaved cut. I`m letting it grow out, and explained that if he didn`t want to do anything with it, not to worry, I`ll gel the front down at home, and to focus on the back. He immediately grabbed the straightener, and started to try and straighten the most damp part of my hair. He didn`t part it, or properly blow dry my hair with a rolling comb. As I was experiencing this, a blond woman with straightened hair was having a consultation with a cut with a stylist that spoke perfectly fluent English. She admitted to him that her hair was naturally curly. There was no immediate double charge for her, no eye rolls, no treatment as though she was a second rate citizen. As soon as I saw this I turned around at asked to speak to the manager, who was smoking a cigarette outside. He came in and I went over to the front desk to explain my experience about the double charge with no consultation. He said it was because my hair would take a long time. And I explained that if I had a consultation, you could have just told me that this establishment was unable to handle my hair. I told him I was embarrassed and didn`t feel comfortable being there anymore. They made me pay $35 for the wash. I tipped the gentleman who actually washed my hair, because he did a great job. I will never set foot in that place again. I was hoping to be able to have a nice convenient place to get my hair done, but it`s not God Hands.  My usual hair stylist in Toronto, charges close to the same prices that God Hands does and they work with celebrities of ALL HAIR TYPES  on a regular basis with out double charging them. God Hands is just full of unprofessionals that probably never actually went to any styling academy, and are only suited to work with the select clients that come in (fine, thin, manageable hair) as I look through the reviews here, I understand. After my horrendous experience there, I ran across the street to PureSelf Salon and they had no problem doing emergency damage control, which was done in 40 minutes with leisurely conversation and smiles. Do yourself a favor and start at PureSelf. They certainly saved the day.<15<9<2019<13<19<5

YrTXOl35ve_1M8B8iCL2HQ<6jz_Yr6_AP2WWLbj9gGDpA<lrAUseySfmFeZkWOGfsKnQ<2<8<3<5<"Eh..schmeh!   My buddy at work, Bill, and I had the same lunch break last week.  We decided to hit up some lunch and Bill suggested some tacos.  I am ALWAYS down with tacos for lunch, so I Yelp searched a few spots near work and decided to try this place out.  4.5 star average reviews, close to work, and it sounded like it would be pretty good.  About that...........  We pulled up to the place, walked inside and placed our orders.  They keep things simple here and offer just 2 meats...carne asada and pollo asado.  I went with 4 tacos total, 2 pollo and 2 carne asada.  During lunch, they have their tacos discounted to $2.00 each, instead of regularly priced $3.00 each.  Total was just under $9.00.  I made my way to the salsa bar (the one good thing about the visit), loaded up on their 2 salsa choices, some pico and some cilantro/onion mix.  A couple of minutes later, my tacos were ready. Here is how they were............  Carne Asada-  These tacos came on a flour tortilla with carne asada and some cheese on top.  You dress them yourself.  They looked ok, but unfortunately the taste was not that great.  The carne asada was cubed up a little more than I like, plus the texture and flavor was kind of  '"off'".  It almost tasted like they soaked/grilled the carne asada in soy sauce.  It was a weird flavor.  I am a simple man when it comes to my asada.  Charcoal grilled (if possible), or just some salt and pepper if done on the flat top.  I also hit a few pieces of gristle throughout the 2 tacos.  They weren`t disgusting, but I have had WAY better carne asada tacos. The tortillas they were on WERE good though.  I`ll give them props on their tortillas but that`s about it.  Pollo Asado-  Same presentation as the carne asada.  Chicken, cheese on a flour tortilla.  The pollo asado tasted better than the carne asada, but even then, it was a little too soft for my liking and had the same kind of marinade on it.  Once again, not disgusting, but far from great.  Overall, I think I am just spoiled from having lived in San Diego for 10 years.  We had SO MANY GOOD TACO joints down there that are head and shoulders above anything I have found in Phoenix so far.  I don`t see myself ever craving this place or ever coming back.  Thank goodness it was during lunch and the discounted pricing because if these 4 tacos would have cost me $13-14 dollars, I would have been pissed!  Anyways.....Meh.  2 stars!"<31<3<2017<6<26<8

Obviously, the food is delicious and comfort food for me as I`m a Pinoy.  I have witnessed so many Filipino eateries evolve and shortly go out of business due to lack of consistency.  I want Oming`s to succeed-the food is delicious!  The reason for my rating today is because I ordered a chicken bowl combo and waited an extended amount of time.  There were three staff members working this afternoon and all seemed to be focused on a catering order (who knew catering was on the menu).  There was one order ahead of mine which was 2 combos.  I ordered a chicken combo.  The cook reviewed the order tickets more than 4 times (it couldn`t be that complicated so I`m sure he was just discombobulated).  What was even more confusing was after the cook finished preparing the large trays of food; he went to the register to charge the customer.  Not sure why the other 2 could not complete this cashiering task-they appeared to be lost.  This all could have been more organized and efficient had the cook remained in the kitchen and continued to fire up the two orders that were waiting.  The person who rang up my order was apologetic but he could have easily offered me a free drink for the very long wait.  Stay focused-it`s a simple menu!<20<10<2019<0<39<20

raAMEb-Y2MPCHPnbKnaoIA<39_8yhWlg9KiHXCpetJUBQ<jBkTH0gbhfao2iLB2oYMpA<5<7<0<3<"I`ve known Kevin for several years. I found him after a Groupon to another hypnotherapist left me wanting. I chose to quit smoking without the use of more chemical influences & didn`t wish the transference of energy to be anything but accountable so as not to replace it with yet another crutch. I researched the variety of books attributed to NLP & classic hypnosis techniques. It`s such an intricate and often over-looked area. After all, how does one quantify '"expertise'" in a field that is unjustly criticized? Like an internal doctor, the methods of study don`t compare to the passion that drives a person to serve those that suffer. One size does not fit all.   After three sessions, Kevin was not only able to help me kick the habit but allowed me the space to explore my own subconscious mind, the triggers that fed my neurosis, and other bits to be aware of as they did surface later. He has always made himself available for my questions and never made me feel as if I was '"wrong'" for my belief systems.   I would say the Projection Screen method is A+ in replacing negative thought patterns. And tapping is undoubtedly a close ally even if it looks a tad silly in public.   To be clear, I`ve reviewed Kevin`s hypnosis center before but Yelp erases such when a company moves location. I`ve sent him several references from weight loss, to pain management, to PTSD. His techniques are wide-ranging but more than that, he is a truly kind and wise person, & one of the few people I can share complex details of my life and know he can see and utilize the patterns therein for my greater benefit.   Vegas is blessed to have him."<2<7<2017<21<22<33

I came here with a group of friends, and despite it being busy on a Sunday night, we were seated pretty quick. They have monthly specials, which I decided to try the Nokou Tonkotsu Miso ramen (spicy pork miso broth, with pork flank, eggs, corn, scallions and spinach) along with their homemade lemonade. The food came out quickly and it did not disappoint. The ramen came in a generous portion, had a very rich and flavourful broth being not too spicy, the pork being very juicy and the egg cooked perfectly. I also loved their lemonade, which was very refreshing, pairing perfectly with such a rich ramen!   Overall, the ramen is pretty good and their employees are very pleasant! Another great thing is that you have the choice to customize your ramen, from broth, toppings and noodles. However, it can get pretty pricey compared to other places, as some of the basic toppings must be added $. I would suggest going for their specials to get the best value, as well as their lemonade to refresh yourself!<28<1<2019<4<59<29
asJBH6NFeOw164tkSHuoNA<KBHTIaz-OdXukREefkP4qg<ghwcjmCP3SEGzVPpZE_4Dg<5<3<1<2<"My boyfriend and I went to Monopole on a Friday night. The initial plan was just to stop in for a glass of wine and an appetizer and the go somewhere else for dinner but we ended up staying till past midnight and had dinner and wine there.   We each started with a glass of red wine and shared the parsnip, bacon and aïoli dish. Before then I don`t think I ever ate parsnips but it was surprisingly good! It was my favorite dish and yet it was pretty simple. Then we had the cavatelli with pumpkin and chanterelles mushroom followed by another glass of red wine. The pasta was also pretty delicious.  Lastly we had the Jerusalem artichoke because two of the staff recommended it. Unfortunately it was my least favorite dish.  It was ok. It tasted a bit smokey to me and I`m not really a fan of that. I thought it would be good because they put a layer of cheese and then flame it.   I really enjoyed the red wines. There was two that I particularly enjoyed. My favorite out of the two was the Cardin. I think they change the wine selection and even the food menu pretty often.   Although the wine and food were good, I`m mainly giving this place five stars because of the service. I was very impressed with the owner. He came around taking our order and at one point we wanted to try another glass of red wine and he said '" follow me... '" then we went into the wine cellar and he let us try all the red wine bottles he had opened that night! There must have been five wines that were open! It was fun doing a bit of wine tasting! That was so nice of him ! There was one bottle in particular that we really enjoyed but there was only about a glass and a half left so he gave us what was left of the bottle for the price of one glass. That`s pretty generous of him.   This wine bar specializes mainly in vegetable dishes and let me tell you these dishes are so tasty! In all honesty think it helps that it is served with a lot of cream or with other ingredients that make it flavourful like bacon or cheese. I`m not a big fan of veggies but if veggies were normally served like this I think I would eat it more.   I will definitely be back and I highly recommend it!! This place is a six min walk from my boyfriend`s condo so it`s very convenient! I`m also curious to try their meat dishes because we sat at the bar and the pan seared pork shoulder dish looked so good!"<22<10<2017<21<7<47

The decor and the food is not presented as fancy and in-trend as Shangri-La or some other newer places but keep in mind it`s actually cheaper than other places. You can also find some sweet deals on Groupon for this place if you keep your eyes out for them.   The scones are better than the other venues and the food has a standard quality that doesn`t change. Furthermore my group has always had to take food home because we were so full after all the food. Everything seems small and dainty but it`s actual quite a large quantity of food. When I went to the Shangri-La with a large group I was actually left pretty hungry - they definitely did not give us enough for the group.   Of all the times that I have been to Windsor Arms for the afternoon tea, service has also never been an issue and I am very sensitive about good service.

Our only complaint was that the tables were spaced too close together.  We were seated at a table near the entrance.

My girlfriend and I each had eggs benedict and coffees, and it was 40 bucks!  Second reason, the portions are huge.  I am always disappointed to see such huge portions coming out of a professional kitchen, because I realize how much food is headed toward the trash bin each day.  If you must serve such huge portions, please advise on the menu ahead of time.    The most important reason I won`t head back here...  unripened fruit as a garnish on my plate.  Just serve me what`s in season please.  If it is in season, a tomato in summer for example, please make sure it`s fresh, local, and ripe.  I was shocked when the waitress asked me if I wanted to add tomato to my dish and then she served me a hard, barely pink slice of tomato.  It`s in season people!  Where did this tomato come from, South America?<21<7<2010<22<21<15

My friend and I wanted to go and just see a show, and were told that we needed to pay a $60 cover charge. We obliged, not knowing any better, and were soon flanked by a cadre of girls. My friend and I were immediately separated and led to private rooms, where we were immediately solicited under the guise of playful conversation. Shortly after, a senior member of the staff approached me and listed exhorbitant prices for something I wasn`t sure I actually wanted to take part in.  I insisted on talking to my friend about this to consult what we actually wanted to do here, but the girls refused to let me, and misled me several times on his financial and emotional commitment to a private session. I was led to an ATM and coerced into making a withdrawal for something that I didn`t want to do.  I felt incredibly violated. In a way, it felt like highway robbery posing under a much softer guise.

Well new friends let me tell you that I have had nothing but positive experiences at Spectra. Yes there`s dog poop but the management sends notices all of the time and ultimately isn`t it the pet owners responsibility? Put the pressure on them! Oh I do agree that some neighbors suck... welcome to apartment living. I would hope that if you feel threatened you`d call 9-1-1. Some people just suck and management has to see both sides and people that suck are good at hiding their crappy sides. With the feral cats, it sucks when people feed them, they do fine keeping the rodent and scorpion population down for us residents. They don`t need food but I can say as a tiny dog owner that walks all over the complex and goes by the 3-4 cats I`ve seen, they`ve never once approached my dog. The management at Spectra allowed me to move to a different apartment no problem when I didn`t like the location of my first one. They have always been kind and quick to respond. My maintenance requests have been addressed in very timely fashion and they try very hard to keep the grounds very clean. Remember they can`t control dumb people that throw their crap in the parking lot or don`t take the time to put their trash INSIDE the trash dumpsters. Ultimately it`s up to you where you live but take the time to visit complexes at all times of the day and night, walk around and see what`s what.  We love Spectra and we have 2 parts of our family in apartments here and have for awhile. Educate yourself on apartment living and the location of the apartment in the complex.<19<2<2019<17<4<13

So delicious.  I not all don`t like thicker crusts but this was so fluffy it was amazing. Toppings we got half pesto and half veggie.  The pesto was a little faint and overpowered by the ricotta on top.  The veggie was ok. Next time I`ll probably just stick with cheese   Smoked lemonade for drinks.  Moderately smoked  and lightly sweetened. It`s the best lemonade I`ve ever had. I tried to duplicate it at home but I over smoked my lemons.    Dessert: Italian donuts. More amazing carbs.

After calling to hear that the wait was 15-20 minutes, I decided to bring our family there. When we arrived we were told it would be 20-30. The actual wait was 50 minutes. After being seated, the waitress took a while to come ask us what drinks we wanted. We ordered all our drinks and food right away. She said she put in the order first then brought our drinks. After about 30 minutes and my baby asking to eat several times, I asked how much longer it would be. This is where she told us it would come when it comes and that they opened at 630 so what did we expect? Not cool snooze.  My advice, if you venture here, eat before. IT took us almost two hours between the wait and the arrival of our food, so if you have small kids it might be too long of a wait as it was for our little ones.

When he was shaping them they were pretty much all crooked and I asked him multiple times to fix them. After showing him they are slanted he filed one down so much it was noticeably a lot shorter than my other finger . When he fixed another slanted one he asked better? I said I mean I guess it`s better he then got up and stormed off . Never has this happened to me , especially over the fact his work was not good and I wanted them corrected. He has another women come finish, she comes over and says that he asked her to do the top coat because it can be hard to do. I said '" is there a problem ? I know that doing the top coat is not hard'" she proceeded to put the top coat on, and had me dry my nails . She did not fix them, did not have me wash the powder off under neath my nails or remove it.

lcfUuBy0qSWrPRRblRkrbA<1kNsEAhGU8d8xugMuXJGFA<iCy1TXsMxohuCaGogV8ZjQ<3<1<0<0<Oakville GO is the busiest GO station outside Union Station. It shows as well, with the frequent amount of trains arriving during peak periods, as well as the huge amount of parking lots (all full) and passengers rushing out of the station to get to their cars/buses.  The track platforms are actually set up quite conveniently. Westbound trains usually arrive at track 1, which means passengers don`t need to go through the underpass in order to access the north parking lots and the bus terminal.   However, the bus terminal itself really needs to be redone. The front platform bay (I believe it holds the 1 and 4 East?) frequently has two buses at once, and no bus can leave the station unless one of the two aforementioned buses move first...it can potentially cause quite a bit of delay for other routes.<18<5<2013<1<51<12

Very hard to get in contact with when you have a concern, however, they expect you to be available 24/7 to answer any of their small issues. To begin with, on more than one occasion when I went to pay my monthly rent, I noticed that the amount charged on the online portal was higher than it should be, so I had to contact the management to have it lowered to the correct amount. (I was able to cross-check with my rent + the utilities bill mailed). Furthermore, upon moving out, they have not sent me any information regarding my security deposit return or damages that would have caused my deposit to be withheld. I have emailed and called multiple management employees for weeks, yet have not received a reply from anyone. Under Ohio law and in the lease contract it states that the security deposit should be returned WITHIN 30-days of move out, however it has been 60+ days and still no contact. Finally, I emailed a concierge team member, as I`m still receiving property event emails as if I still live there, and she stated she would get in contact with the property manager about the '"process/update for my security deposit'" however that was a week ago and no reply since. There are much nicer places to live in Cleveland for far less trouble and money spent. Also, it seems like shoddy construction that was done very rapidly, not worth the price. Many kitchen drawers/cabinets are off-centered and crooked. For the first couple months of my tenancy, the bathroom light would turn on and off at-random on its own, so I could be taking a shower and the lights would shut off or sleeping only to be woken by the lights being turned on. Not only was this annoying, but I`m sure this caused by utilities to increase from the lights being on at random times. Also, the air conditioning unit is extremely loud. I wouldn`t recommend living at One University Circle."<22<7<2019<14<48<43

My husband needed a hair cut BAD and I was having a problem finding a place that would cut his hair not butcher it. We just got finished eating dinner and it was around 6pm. I noticed across the street from where we were eating that Great Clips was still open. We get to the shop, but on the door it says that they close at 6pm. I run up to the door and poke my head in and asked if they had time for a quick cut. The lady was extremely nice and was happy to cut hair even though they were about to close. I didn`t get an attitude or anything.  My husband sits down, tells her exactly what he wants and which side to go easy on (he has '"cow-licks'" all over his head so it`s hard to get a decent cut on him) and the lady (sorry, I can`t remember her name) understood everything he said.  15 minutes later, she was done and did a great job! She listened to my husband and we were both happy with his hair. She also told him that she will call him when he will be due to get another hair cut (since he goes so long without 1 and it`s like pulling teeth to get him to go).  My friend that was with us also got a quick trim and she was happy with the outcome. Her stylist was a different person than my husband`s though.  Over all, great service and I hope we have found somebody that will cut my husband`s hair right!! Total for the haircut: $13"<2<11<2009<19<37<49

I watched that video of Mr. Ramsay grilling that patty  and I been wanting to try it. Few things to mention first just so that you are aware. Long lines? Yes, we waited about 45 minutes in line to get a table on a Wednesday evening. Over priced? Yes, we payed $90 for three people not including tip. I understand the novelty if eating at a restaurant associated with a celebrity might mark up the prices so just be advise. Waiting to get our food was the average time. Once we got our food, presentation was worth the high standards of Mr. Ramsay. Simple yet classy with originality. I got their classic cheeseburger, cooked medium, with all the condiments. I have to say, the burger was pretty good. Juice, thick, and flavorful. While it did not disappoint, the price tag was a little beyond for what it ultimately is: a cheeseburger.  It should be noted that it does not include fries or other sides. However,  despite my reluctance to embrace the price tag, I have to admit,  it was a pretty damn good patty.

DSaxiQOQCq64-Zz_osahiA<ZlDYPORxTpNgImmbwIn3Dw<8Z2GBnuOEXbnzzapWSo9tg<5<3<0<1<Another stellar Yelp Elite event for the books!  The staff at Inishmore welcomed us with open arms.  A phenomenal team they are.  It was heartwarming to hear the owner`s story.  Murph, founder of Murphy`s in Uptown, and Inishmore shared the history behind the name and menu choices.  It all made perfect sense.   The food was abundant.  The evening kicked off with a pear based cocktail that was handcrafted inhouse and did not disappoint.  From there, appetizers were rolled out family-style.  They included Rueben eggrolls with 1000 Island Dressing, Cajun BBQ prawns served over cauliflower grits (shockingly made 100% of cauliflower and I never would`ve known), and mussels.  Following the appetizers was a choice of butter lettuce salad or cream of vegetable soup.  I went with the soup option, and I was pleasantly surprised.  The soup was hearty and flavorful with just the right consistency.  This coming from someone that wouldn`t` describe himself as a soup eater.   The main course options included Coq Au Vin (chicken), shepherd`s pie, Irish stew, or fish & chips.  I considered the fish & chips, as it was the safest option for my tastes, but I opted for the shepherd`s pie instead.  A base blend of ground beef, ground lamb, peas, and carrots, topped with fluffy layer of whipped potatoes; it made for the perfect blend in every bite.  A comforting dish for a cold December evening served with a nice cabernet.  The evening was wrapped with an after dinner peppermint coffee, chocolate chess pie, and Irish crème brulee.  I devoured more than my fair share of each dessert with no shame.    The chef and bar tender each shared some insight around their creations as the event came to a close.  Elites left full and happy!  I will certainly recommend Inishmore!  Thank you for the hospitality!<10<12<2019<3<20<5

You`re likely to find their beans in your favorite coffee shop. So it`s pretty safe to expect a wonderful cup of coffee out of their own establishment.   There`s quite a few St-Henri coffee shops in Montreal, but the one in the St-Henri neighbourhood is - surprise - the original. Roasting is done in the back of the shop, while the barista prepared cups of caffeinated goodness for patrons sitting toward the windows. It smells good in there, and the church pews and rickety wooden chairs make the whole place seem warm and homely - the perfect stop after a long walk on a cool spring afternoon.   I got intrigued by their selection of rather unusual herbal teas (mostly from plants found in Quebec`s northern wilderness), and went for the '"thé boréal'", a mix of what might be nettle, black currants and other plants. It was very good. We shared a banana bread that was moist and rich with brown sugar and chocolate. My boyfriend got the prettiest latte, with all these tiny bubbles in the delightfully rich crema.

yWhqzTHpdgGLFBTVwvL12g<FRiM8l0TLdZXM1nQJZeWKg<G4X5w5vRQNEFUmrJo6JakA<1<0<0<0<HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE...Just to begin and try to be short but straight to the point... this establishment is located in a wonderful shopping center located in Glendale near the hockey Stadium. I enjoyed the event, 49ers take over against the Arizona Cardinals but I paid a lot of money to enjoy a spectacular celebration and then there was a buffet serving food to hundreds of people located within McFadden`s patio area where I stood in line for quite some time and had my hands full and at the very end I step backwards to move out of the way and tripped on an electrical outlet sticking out of the ground next to a tree and fell. None of the staff came to help me and all they said was you should have been watching where you were going which I understand in a sense but how was I supposed to watch behind me while trying to fill a plate full of food. The buffet should not have been where it was located PERIOD.  I then proceeded to contact management for some help with the facts some clothing being ruined and many bruises that came with this fall and they decided they were not willing to help me or treat me in any manner that you would expect a good customer service. Just warning all others that may attend a large group event at this establishment BEWARE of your surroundings. They do not give a shit about their customers. GO NINERS...<10<12<2019<22<17<25

I interviewed quite a few lawyers in Vegas, the big one`s you see on billboards and I left each one with feeling skeptical and shady about them especially after reading their reviews. I felt comfortable choosing Eric and I was not let down at all. The professionals he works with for medical care were the best as well. When my case closed I was very happy with his work and he was honest when he said he wouldnt take more than me and re-adjusted my figure to keep his promise. Marshall wants his clients to feel like family and I definitely did while working with him and his medical professionals he works with. You are in fantastic hands if you see Ross Medical and Loren Marshall Chiropractic. If I ever need another injury lawyer I will only deal with Eric. Overall, Eric you went above and beyond my expectations especially with your honesty and care and I hope you will always be like that :) THANK YOU<5<12<2019<20<29<7

After a miscommunication about a Groupon and the customer being upset because the owner grabbed her phone to see the Groupon, the owner started swearing at the customer telling her to '"shut the f*ck up and get the f*ck out of here.'" Her husband (co-owner) tried to calm the situation but his wife continued throwing a fit and told him to get his hands off of her when he tried to hold her back from the customer; so unprofessional. I will NEVER dine there again. The food was good but not worth dealing with the drama/nonsense.

I got these tickets for my girlfriends birthday celebration because she was visiting from Chicago, sad, and loves music. (Me too... the music part) Okay, honestly where are the kids who like real music?! The crowd was as expected but these guys deserve to have everyone come out and experience their talent. Not to mention a family/friends thing going on? I`m seriously in love!! :) I`m glad I checked them out.   My only suggestion would be to arrange the stage so that the drummer isn`t hidden! All the musicians were amazing but I had to keep moving around to see the drum kit! :)  PS The negative reviews are actually true, but 1. I like loud music 2. If I wanted to see a cover band to stay in one genre/era there are plenty of opportunities in Vegas for that.  So I still recommend!!<7<6<2018<2<34<26

I had gone into this store to ask about a Gucci watch that I was interested in selling and while waiting for my turn to speak with the representative working at the counter I sure got a representation of the company!!  It was one of ignorance, racism and belittlement. There was a gentleman with a middle eastern accent that refused an offer that was given to him by the representative for the sale of his jewlery and said that he wanted to have his jewlery appraised elsewhere. He was very calm and kindly asked for his jewlery back, as it had been taken to a back room to appraise. The representative-using a very loud and obnoxious voice was heard in the front area of the store calling the gentleman horrible names in the back room using profanity. He also yelled and insulted him by offering  him gas money. When he came back with the jewlery- again being loud and obnoxious the whole time, he made another slightly higher offer to the gentleman but this time using a middle eastern accent (making fun of him). When the offer was refused he yelled '"scum always rises!!!!!'" I couldn`t believe my eyes or ears!!! I was in complete shock. Luckily he refused to buy my watch  because it was '"too small'", because I would have truly regretted giving them my business had we made a deal. Please go elsewhere!!!"<11<2<2016<22<4<0

It`s not just one or two shocking experiences, it has been recent multiple and inexcusable encounters.  I have been shopping at this Bashas` since it opened. I used to enjoy the employees and even the energy in the store. The energy there is so bad now!! It feels like NONE of the employees want to be there! I can understand on some level, but it doesn`t give an employee the right to be rude and obnoxious to their customers or even refuse a simple request at the meat counter.

qTAiHevwEV1aTn_FomQIlg<HvDBT2whHCalPX7eWgmrqw<wWiD3B6p5Dwu9jeQs6GJBA<4<6<0<0<I had been to this restaurant space when it was Dunnings, then Ease and now Frick Park Tavern. I was anxious to see the changes they had made. We went this past Friday around 5pm and were seated immediately. Right away I loved the decor---new lighting and wallpaper.  The menu looked similar to what Ease offered- just slimmed down. The kids menu is exactly the same from what I remembered. My daughter ordered the pasta and applesauce. I ordered the FPT burger - no bacon. It was REALLY good. The onion ring was a nice touch. My husband ordered the chicken sandwich and he had no complaints.  We ordered the seasonal fruit tart for dessert. I wasn`t a huge fan. Not sure if I`m the best critic since I don`t usually eat dessert.  I`m really glad Frick Park Tavern opened finally. It is a good addition to the restaurants in the square. We will definitely be back. When we left around 6:30 the restaurant was packed! Expect to wait if you come around that time. Glad to see the restaurant doing well.<13<11<2019<17<42<31

FB9AWXkxRgd58U86i3NtTQ<TwUqavuMpDWCw9iCva3KXA<RemaGokjnHrNVoOtW83oOA<4<4<0<3<A little sophistication and class added to The Fremont East Entertainment District. Craft cocktails, very respectable wine and beer choices, delectable array of artisanal nibbles, and a small cabaret theater toward the back that appears will feature a fair amount of jazz and some other off the beaten path/eclectic programming. For the edibles, think items along the lines of high quality brie, cheeses, olives, breads, meats, berries, etc. Perfect for sharing with good company. Staff has been very attentive, friendly, and personable. I thought a cool feature was while the jazz band was playing in the more secluded back stage area, they piped that live music toward the front bar area, perfect for keeping the vibe throughout the entire space. The piped in music was played at a level that was not intrusive and seemed to encourage a good vibe and (most importantly) good conversation. The Scullery will certainly not attract the high fiving brah crowd, and I have a feeling that`s just the way they like it. Oh, and very easy valet parking across the street at El Cortez, for those that think walking a few blocks is just out of the question.<23<5<2014<3<33<39

z56MX0wn2T4W64pI6Jyvhw<0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w<PQER4ba8Q0zqB1G2QiXamQ<3<8<7<8<Black Bear Diner is an icon that has stood at the corner of Jones and Tropicana for years. Contrary to what the name might imply to some people, Black Bear Diner did not start out serving bear meat. It started as an inn in Mount Shasta, California that overlooked a strawberry patch that was inhabited by both people and black bears. Approximately ninety years later Black Bear Diner seems to be a healthy business. They have several locations including this very one at the northwest corner of Tropicana Avenue and Jones Boulevard.     Black Bear Diner operates by six (6) credos. I have put each credo to the test. This review lists each credo with Yelping feedback. Please bear with me, while I grow my yelp into a growl while I give feedback on each of the six credos.  Credo #1: We will make Black Bear Diner a place where you can feel comfortable and relaxed. We offer you great food and an experience reminiscent of a time when a small-town restaurant was the place to go for talk, friendship and atmosphere.  A Yelper`s growl: On my visits that occurred during the afternoon of June 22 and the morning of June 23, 2013; the lodge theme made me relaxed. There is nothing like a hundred stuffed bears to make me feel at ease. Black Bear Diner reminds me more of a bear themed Cracker Barrel than a small-town restaurant. The menu which mimics a newspaper and the place mats were interesting reading material. Being in the information age where friends, especially yelp friends are within the touch of a handheld device, I could say that the excellent Verizon reception contributed to making this a place for friendship.  Credo #2: We are dedicated to serving freshly prepared home cooking. From scratch sausages and biscuits to our legendary Black Bear Cobbler, everyone at Black Bear Diner goes the extra mile to provide you with the best in good old fashioned family food, prepared fresh every day.  A Yelper`s growl: Based on the Shasta cheeseburger with fries that I ate on June 22 and the Bear`s Choice Breakfast special that I ate on June 23; I thought that the food was good yet not extraordinary. I would have appreciated more cheese on the Shasta cheeseburger, warmer fries, and a choice of syrups and toppings for the pancakes.  Credo #3 We deliver each meal just the way you order it.  A Yelper`s growl: This ought to be mentioned when the server takes your order. When I ordered the Bear`s Choice Breakfast, this would have been nice if it was brought to my attention. I would of enjoyed more beacon instead of pancakes.  Credo#4: We believe in value-hearty portions of good food. We buy huge platters and we fill them, so don`t be afraid to take leftovers home!  A Yelper`s growl: The portions are huge. However, I feel that instead of filling up a lot of the plate with fries that they ought to replace some of them with the choice of potato salad or cole slaw. For the record fries are not the kind of food that tastes good warmed up.    Credo #5: We feature healthy options because we care about our customers.  A Yelper`s growl: I do not go to a diner, especially named Black Bear to eat healthy. I say good for them for featuring healthy options. I would like to add that all the stuffed bears and bear memorabilia was good for my mental health. Stuffed bears have a way of reducing my stress level.   Credo #6: If you have comments that bear repeating, please tell us. If you have extraordinary service, or have something to growl about, we want to hear from you. Please visit our website to let us know how we are doing.  A Yelper`s growl: Growling on business websites is not my style. My style is to growl on Yelp. With that in mind my growl of Black Bear Diner is 3  1/2 stars.  ***The Daniel. S 2013 Yelp 100 Challenge. This is review 90***<28<6<2013<6<35<51
J8SSeecN0j9p4oKcOdRxlg<i7QG1ixeuFwpemeLvmRKHA<nXoShX5FzJiFFD07aANiVw<5<12<7<10<"If you say Johnny`s, the collective voice in Toronto would be Johnny`s Hamburgers - rightly so as it`s been an icon for half a century.  However, I propose to you another place to consider.  Johnny`s Shawarma!  If I was back in my old hood, I would have a seat with my name on it etched in bronze for all ages.  This place isn`t about just being a quick serve, it`s about having a food experience.  First time, Johnny`s was at the Taste of the Middle East.  Second time, I got to experience the whole menu at an event.  I made it a note to return and do a write up of this place.  It`s only fair that another Johnny`s in Scarborough gets some attention - as little as I may be able to drum up.  Johnny is a charismatic and tireless soul.  He is a both a showman and an excellent purveyor of fine mid-east food.  His motto is '"Addiction Guaranteed'" and he does his best to deliver on it.  The food quality is very good and for those who look to be comfortably full, you will have no arguments here as the quantity is very generous.  Each dish is prepared fresh and amazing.  He even carves his shawarma by hand!  Not some sheep shear that many are using now.  Why is hand carving so important?  Have you been to a real deli?  They tell you that hand carved meats for sandwiches are better...why?  Who cares, it just is!  We don`t argue...we just enjoy.  Well, trust me, hand carved shawarma is the way to go!  Thick chunks of meat with just the right sear on one end and juicy through the rest.  All the taste and no taste of machine oil and metal - yeah, you didn`t think of that did ya!?!  My ratings is quite simple (and I do change it up here and there) up to 3 stars for food.  1 extra for ambiance. 1 more for service.  It`s a quick serve restaurant in Scarborough so ambiance will suffer a bit but let`s say Johnny`s personality makes up for it!  Oh BTW as Johnny says... '"Don`t ever be sorry, unless you had shawarma somewhere else!'"  Somehow this rang true as I live in Richmond Hill and rarely make it out to Scarborough and had shawarma elsewhere.  I`m still paying for it two days later, and they used the Sheep Shears!!! - UGH! FML!  CHEERS!!!"<24<11<2019<16<16<52

I pleaded with him to be honest with me as I had to move that day. He said he`d show up so I waited. Then he sent a text an hour later saying his friend would move me.  I texted his friend but no answer. His friend then finally texted back an hour later and said he can move me later in the afternoon.

I was no doubt in heat as I perused their titillating sweets menu section. Of course, it wasn`t very practical to order everything because the desserts are a bit on the pricier side, so despondently, I restricted myself to just one dessert.   For an eventful dessert experience, be sure to sit at the bar: most of their artistic desserts are intricately assembled before your eyes. The appeal of this small dessert bar is the preparation and presentation of each dessert.   On the evening of my visit, I tried the Mars dessert. They flambe brandy and pour it over the chocolate shell, giving it an adult edge. I loved how this dessert wasn`t cloyingly sweet. From other reviews, one shouldn`t expect overwhelming sweetness with any of their desserts actually.   If you`re a gentleman looking to get lucky, then you`ll want to bring your date here for some satiating foreplay. The scrumptious desserts from here will probably make your companion want to come (back) multiple times.<1<12<2019<21<57<2

I`ve been needing to check out the Chinese food scene in town and struck gold coming to this place. The food was delicious and I thought was authentic.   I order the spicy dry pepper chicken and it was so good and savory! I had tried something similar in Canada, but this was one better. The quality of the chicken was good, cooked just right, the dry red peppers were also cooked to perfection that I enjoyed eating them, too. This dish was not overly spicy either.  The tea-smoked duck was delicious! Crispy on the outside, tender dark meat! The tea, smoky infused flavors were all there to make it a unique dish.   I enjoyed my poultry Chinese dinner and won`t hesitate to come back again! Service was speedy and prices were fair. Portions are shareable.<5<10<2019<23<43<45

Although most reviews say that the portions are small, the khao soi was just enough. The flavours reminded me of the exact same khao soi I`ve had in Thailand that I keep dreaming of. This is probably the only restaurant that has this dish in Montreal (that I`ve seen or heard of at least). The chicken slid off the bone and into the creamy and spicy broth, which was delicious. The crunchy noodles also blended perfectly with the softer ones in the soup dish.   I can`t wait to go back to this restaurant as the dish was very authentic, even the spice level. The staff are also super friendly and are always around for anything you may need. They even set up the dish in front you so that it is picture ready!<5<10<2019<13<50<22

Gs4NGWzPTObYpA5oOkz6vw<__RoSKn4Y5gImPoRkwJACQ<narFmQxq5-D2eHZf4q0hgA<3<4<0<1<"Giving blood just seems like such an easy way to put some good into the country (UBS ships the blood they collect all over the country!), so I do it every 8 weeks.   This location is a little difficult to find, as it`s in an office park that is totally empty all the time, all the way in the corner. It`s very clean and the staff there are very nice (I had a terrible experience at the W Charleston center, where the staff is rude). I have had an experience at this location that was inconvenient, but was chalked up to a new tech not knowing all the donation options.  Here`s what to expect: 1. Your blood pressure, temperature and pulse will be taken. Your pulse must be under 100 bpm (hot weather increases pulse). If any of these are too high, you can`t donate that day. 2. Your iron level will be tested with a prick on your finger. If your iron is too low, you can`t donate. 3. There are 3 options for donation: whole blood, plasma and double red cell. Anyone can donate whole blood, although it makes many people woozy. Plasma can be donated by anyone who has never been pregnant. Double red cell requires you to be at least 5`5'" and 150+ pounds. The last two options are the easiest on your body. 4. Your arms will be checked for lesions. If you have anything that could be construed as a needle mark, they will reject you.  5. You`ll be asked some semi-uncomfortable questions about sex, but they`re simply part of the screening process.  6. They`ll do their best to make you comfy with blankets, heating pads, ice, refreshments, etc.  7. Whole blood takes about 20 minutes. Plasma takes about 30 minutes. Double red takes about 2 hours. (These times are for actual donation only. The interview, set-up and post-donation resting period/snack fest take more time) 8. Every time you go, regardless of whether you`re able to donate or not, you`ll receive a '"prize'", generally tickets to something (a 51s game, this time!).  All in all, giving blood is the least I can do and the people here make it as easy and painless as possible!"<17<6<2012<4<15<38

Overall the staff at the food vending areas were wonderful to deal with. The staff I saw walking around were answer questions and were friendly.   At the end of the game there was a trophy ceremony for the Clemson Tigers. We stayed to see the ceremony and get a photo, or at least see, our favorite Clemson player. We were there with several hundred other Clemson fans.   As soon as the trophy passed hands to the coach we were told to leave by two employees. They said the event was over and that they wanted to go home. Keep in mind the players and coaches were still on the field. So I question how the event was '" over'".  We I questioned the employee about why we had to leave. I told him that we have been to numerous championships and bowl games and have stayed to see the team. He said the event was over and we had to go.   My son and I ended up leaving, after being threatened by the police. My brother stayed for almost another half hour because he was told he could stay and get the photos by a different employee.   Last time I go to the stadium for anything. I will put my money into better bowl game seats, better seats at Clemson games or maybe better tires on my car.   We are a 20 plus year season ticket holder for Clemson who has gone to a lot of bowl games, ACC Championship games and other events at this stadium. Never have we been treated so poorly.  Recommend you watch you event on TV and NOT go.  I sent an email to the ACC about this and am planning on sending several more out"<9<12<2019<3<50<25

I called Burnley Friday on my mom`s recommendation. I got an appointment for Saturday where they gave my mouth the once over. (I haven`t been to a dentist since I had the crown put in.)  I have to tell you I am NOT disappointed.   Not only do they take my insurance, but because I saved the crown that came off and it still fit properly I saved a ton of money. They put the crown back on for me Sunday.   The office is a bit dated, and you won`t get all the fancy stuff like other offices, but their prices reflect why, they are super affordable.   Coti is exceptional at what he does and explained all the charges prior to service, and also explained how and what my insurance would take care of.   They definitely have a customer for as long as they remain open.

I was told by my sales rep Dennis that the baseboards were also included in my total price. After the work was complete, I asked the installer (who by the way didn`t speak English too well) where are my baseboards, he replied his boss would contact me he then shoved a clipboard in my face told me to sign and left. His boss Devin contacted me and advised that the sales rep Dennis didn`t list the baseboards on my order, however that can do them for an additional $1400. I advised Devin I do not have another $1400 to spend with them. I also advised him that the quarter rounds that were listed on the contract were not installed. The installer left trash, dirt, supplies, and a razor blade that my 2year old nephew could have gotten a hold of. They also left all the old baseboards in my garage and throughout my home. I spoke with Devin yesterday and he advised me they would be back out by noon. As I sit here typing it is the next day Sunday 535pm and no one has shown up. The commercial says install is free if not completed by Thanksgiving, well with all the trash, unfinished quarter rounds my home is not ready for my family on Thanksgiving.

I find it rather ridiculous for a salesperson to tell me the end date of a sale is October 2nd... When in all actuality the sale doesn`t end until December. And, what is even more striking is how the Regional Manager didn`t quite see a problem with this... I do! The sale doesn`t end for 2 more months. Your sales people shouldn`t give misinformation to coerce a customer into purchasing a fixture; I think that`s unethical. You have nice quality products and I would have thought your establishment would have matched the quality with great customer service and ethics, but I guess that isn`t the case.<12<10<2017<20<24<26

Also, I like how they send you email and text confirmation to remind you of your appointment. They also call the day before as well.   I have a lot of thick hair on my lower legs but wanted to try a Groupon deal on my under arms first. I think the deal was for 6 or 8 sessions. About mid way through I decided I was making good progress so went ahead and purchased another package for my lower legs.  The first time wasn`t too painful however the times after that was. They increase the strength on the laser every time you come in. I`m happy with the service and the outcome of my laser treatments. I finished the sessions I paid for and my underarm hair is a lot thinner. I`m only halfway through the treatment for my legs but decided that my underarms need a few more treatments to be completely gone so I went ahead and purchased their holiday special which is only around $65 a month for 3 areas. I`ve chosen underarms, legs and bikini area.

JLgFqPpto_OeY5BeGqh0vA<JT8BZ2eAknIdKhKKp19q7g<A-UPD1aji1HP3e6uOmQGeA<1<35<3<1<"Tonight, I witnessed a yoga studio hit an all time low. I have bounced around yoga studios since I moved to Charlotte three years ago and have been frequenting Y2 for the last two months or so. I love the upbeat house music, the staff, and the intensity of the classes so I ignored the factory like feel of the studio and a certain instructor. Whatever - I enjoyed the work out and I love the practice.   It was not until this past class where in the middle of the practice, the yoga instructor announced that he was going to read a passage. I was surprised that he would give some words of encouragement or read a quote on mindfulness, self worth, pain, anything really. Instead, he begins to read a yelp review of an innocent yogi who attended the studio. He read the entire passage, only stopping to laugh between paragraphs. The yelp writer had explained how the studio was too intense for her and that the rooms were too small (things that any type of yelp reviewer would write if they disliked a studio).   After he read the review, he relentlessly began to poke fun at this person, mimic them in a whiny, high pitched voice. At one point, he made a remark along the lines of maybe they should go practice yoga with their grandma (Really - a  Grandma joke?!).  This criticizing went on for the remainder of the class. I could not believe my ears. This man was using his platform as a leader to make fun and criticize another human being for their opinion of his yoga studio. It was sickening to hear a leader of his establishment to act so pompously as if others cannot possibly have their own opinion on what yoga studio they frequent. Everything that yoga is about was thrown out of the window during the 60 minute class. This class was the most disheartening and upsetting acts of hypocrisy that I have witnessed in my years of practicing yoga.   The class then concluded with a house mix of '"Higher Love'" to top it off. Safe to say I will not be returning."<10<5<2017<19<25<34

RQulYouXq_tgD_QKmO57ZA<6uXBD7DH-wwmUfHw5_wqyQ<dJll6hGkOCFztZgFKBTUEA<1<2<0<0<"I recently used Soulmutt`s '"3 Hour Outing to a Private Acre Forest Dog Run'" for my four month old GSD puppy. This service includes picking up your pup from your home, driving them to their private forest area for the 3 hour outing and then dropping the very tired pup home. It seemed to good to be true... and it was. Unfortunately, the first time we used this service will definitely be our last. The communication was good - prompt responses about how the pup was doing and I received a few photos of him playing with the other puppies. I was pleased to know my pup was obeying commands and playing nicely with the other dogs. When my pup was dropped off at home, things immediately went south. First, he had a foul stench on him that wasn`t there before leaving home that morning. But most importantly, there was dried up blood from a very deep cut on his ear and they were very obviously red and scratched. I immediately messaged Soulmutts about this concern and they didn`t reply until 2 hours later (which is understandable as they`re still on the road and busy with other dogs). The reply I received '"Bleeding??? Like the tip???'" was a red flag for me. This response indicates that the bleeding and the cut went unnoticed. Their responses continued to imply that it was likely a puppy that nipped his ear as '"they have teeth and claws like pins so that can certainly break the skin'". Evidently, they did not notice the bleeding so they certainly don`t know what caused it. I`m not upset that my pup got nipped in the ear - as I`ve told the owner that I understand things like this do happen... my concern is the lack of responsibility and the unprofessional behaviour that the owner has shown through her passive aggressive messages such as '"Well, again, sorry that your dog got nipped on the ear on an outing with a dog pack full of puppies! Things like that happen with dogs. such is life. Good luck and take care :)'".  I don`t need an apology for the nip itself - an explanation of why the cut was not noticed and a heads up that he had a cut is what I wanted. Makes you wonder how many dogs are there & what else gets unnoticed."<18<9<2017<4<18<19

I have been looking for dentist for what seems forever, and a day. But when I tell you I`ve found my new dental family, please believe me. From the time I came in for just x rays, and a exam, to today when I got my permanent crown, and a filling it`s been nothing but an awesome experience. Dr. Reese, and her staff make you feel so welcomed, and valued. Her staff alone made me feel comfortable to ask all the questions I had, and I didn`t feel rushed. From start, I told Dr. Reese about my fears, and that I knew I needed a lot of work, and she just sat down with me and went over her process, and my options. She never pushed anything on me like the other dentist I have been to. I can go on, and on about this place, but I rather you come and form your own opinion. But please come, and join the family. You won`t be disappointed. You`ll be more mad that you waited this long.<12<9<2018<20<2<56

MoxdZtTISp40JWyFthDvYg<nwAyj2b68PYQO6NroO1A5w<ThNGovQZjZ5mn-ZwX_N2BQ<4<0<0<0<"I don`t know why The Linq Doesn`t get much love on yelp... Seems like people only come on yelp to complain.. but what about the good experiences ?  ....Crickets...  I recently stayed at the Linq via a third party booking site (Hotwire/cheaper) for a handful of days and Halloween was the epicenter of the planned trip.   We had ZERO problems.  I wanted to share my experience and speak on what I kept reading on these reviews as I was a bit concerned going thru the booking.  CHECK IN  We check in, we talked our way into getting a free upgraded room (junior suite, because it was '"available'"). Resort fee is a confirmed $39 per night. Everywhere in Vegas you will be paying something around that, I`ve asked.  ELEVATORS    Elevators wait times were no problem to us, most of the people waited for the elevators on the main hallway but there are a set of vacant elevators behind those main ones. There is even marked signs and arrows..we waited no more that a minute every time.   PRICE / LOCATION  BEST PRICE FOR THE LOCATION YOUR IN THE MIDDLE OF EVERYTHING. The Linq promenade on Halloween fit in perfectly.  Modern room, comfy bed, ample space (junior suite).  We had zero problems throughout our 4 day stay.  Never used housekeeping but speaking to a few in the hallways were always friendly.   PARKING  It is true there is some construction going on throughout the exterior property. And although it can be confusing to find the parking lot from the strip, we had no problem eventually arriving at the Linq parking lot. Parking entrance is essentially after the Linq and in between the Harrahs property line. You head down, and follow the signs if your heading to the linq. NO WAIT to enter nor leave the facility. Parking is confirmed $15 per day, but upon check out , i went up to the pay station inside the lobby and told the woman on the prompter that I had lost my ticket ($15 for lost ticket) so I only payed one days worth of parking, save your self some money because resort fees take much of it.     CONS ?  Well a few things,   Water pressure on the shower could have been better.   Bed cover and Sheets released a lot of lint when making the bed in the mornings. Lint rollers saved us on multiple occasions.   This parking garage has tight spaces, use caution, and the floors tend to be very dirty and sticky.   OVERALL   I would stay again and recommend to anyone visiting the strip for a short, cheap (location based) trip.  I was a bit skeptical booking because yelp is a hard place at times, complains rule and sometimes you just want to hear and read everything went smoothly."<4<11<2019<6<54<1

The literature (advertising as to what to see and do in the area) promotes Vegas as now family friendly.  There were a list of free things to do.  The Dolphins at the Venetian were NOT free. We grew up with Dolphins swimming alongside our boat so we easily opted out of that.  The city seems to be in decline.  We came close to catastrophe when the white turn lines that are clearly visible in every city we`ve been to (travel a lot) were not there. Not only that we thought only Flamingo Ave was affected only to find out later and through several residents that most of the city roads don`t even have visible white lines for traffic lanes!! We have never seen anything like it.  Dangerous, cheap, uninviting.  As always, fare and square.  We did like the fountain show at the Belagio.<14<10<2019<17<15<27

Our young kids had been eating in the car for a couple years and the carpet was pretty trashed from dirt, food, and spills. They let me know they weren`t magicians and wouldn`t be able to get every stain out but, wow, they did some serious work.  The interior turned out looking much improved and I was more than pleased. I was equally surprised by the improvement on the exterior with the buffing and polishing of the paint as well as the work they did on polishing the chrome wheels.  Some words of advice, look over everything before they finish just to make sure there`s nothing they`ve missed. A couple days after detail, I noticed a spill under the 3rd row seats that was missed. I messaged Scott via Yelp and he made it a priority to have his crew come out and fix it. Thank you!<5<11<2019<17<51<37

We have not had hot water for four days. We have called them numerous times for every issue we have ever had and rarely get a response and if we do they don`t address the issue in a timely manner. We have small children in the home with no hot water. They show no concern and/or compassion. They raised the rent $250, in one year.

wemhZevana2n9wdLsjw3DA<Bvl5vYeNM-Q9N45TY34VrQ<EIMcfTgbWcbkIGajmPg_pw<3<16<4<8<I ordered for pick up for this location with my cousin to take advantage of the 2 Can Dine for $15.99 deal before it ended. Initially when we called we had called this restaurant`s number and got through to an employee who told us that this wasn`t the correct line and that we had to call back and press 2. However that`s exactly what we did so not sure where the mix up was. We called the general Swiss Chalet line and placed an order that way instead.  My cousin actually let me know that they`re usually pretty slow so we allotted them extra time for prep beyond the 15 minutes that we were quoted. When we arrived there was actually a lot of people waiting in the take out area for their food. Our food was ready though and we were able to pay at the register although the option was offered to pay over the phone as well. Also, don`t forget your Scene card if you collect points.  I love Swiss fries but they were a little soggy by the time we got home. If you`re okay with getting another side I`d recommend that since you lose out on the crispiness factor. The chicken was good though the skin kinda fell victim to the steaminess of the takeout container as well. Sauce still delicious and warm.<14<9<2019<18<47<59

Well, they gave us a code to get in, which was nice because we didn`t have to wait for anyone to let us in! They have free guest WiFi, and that was convenient for our event. The bathrooms were really clean & spacious (men & women both had one stall)  They stocked the drawers with extension cords, HDMI & other office supplies. They even had a screen to do presentations on.  Lots of chairs & tables to set up any way you want. Also a little desk to sit at when you walk in. We used that for our check-in portion.  Plus!

But there seems to be a lot of other customers speaking Korean and seemed happily eating, so the restaurant must be doing something right. We were fortunate to get a table right away, however it typically is tough to get a table here. The entree choices are limited, favored meal size for for +2, and about 50% of the dishes had some level of spiciness. We started the meal with the usual korean side dishes, although the side dishes seem limited in quantity and variety. When our main dishes arrived, the meat was very tender and easily fell off the bone. The price point was also quite good, and the waitress came by twice to check up on us.  Food is good, service is good, parking is only through paid, and wait times can be long. I might prefer KoSam, which is nearby and two stores over because of the smaller wait time for a table and larger menu selection.<8<11<2019<2<48<0

Many of us have food sensitivities that can be a pain the butt for servers.  However, our waiter was so amazing!!! He asked if we wanted to substitute the tomatoes for avocado, the bell peppers for olives, chicken for fish.  We were in shock because most restaurants will charge you extra when you start to switch the recorded menus. I was blown away by their protocol and desire to REALLY make sure we were satisfied.

Not just here but all over the country and this place is Fantastic. I can`t wait to go back. The service was great and the food was great also. I had the 1/2 chicken dinner. It came with rice and beans and tostones. I also had a natural fruit drink that was fantastic I think it was fruit punch or something but it was great also. Trust me  Different day: this time I went there and ordered a chicken wrap with fries. The service was very slow this time and the server didn`t come back to check on us unless she was called. I had to all up to the servers counter to place an additional order for something else I wanted. Now for the chicken wrap, it was different from what I was expecting their wrap came with rice in it and instead of lettuce and tomato like I`m used to. It wasn`t bad just different. If I would`ve know this up front I wouldn`t have ordered it cause I wanted the traditional wrap. Just a FYI so attached a pic.<7<4<2017<23<28<16

For my initial visit i was forced to see the PA for my rare conditions. He didn`t understand the complexity of my conditions so only took a very brief history even tho I`ve been sick & needed to start testing & treatment. He said I would need to see the MD who wasn`t available. I scheduled 2 months out & this clinic didn`t notify me until the last minute that my TriWest Authorization for care was expiring. They were very difficult & challenging to communicate with for myself as the patient & TriWest my Insurance company. They refused to complain the necessary form for Triwest to allow me to see the doctor. The form is called a request for additional service (SAR) which is a Secondary Authorization Request. Everything we did they claimed they never received the form faxed by TriWest, said it`s not their responsibility, said they were locked out of the TriWest website etc etc. Cathy in Patient Services is very rude. When i said they shouldn`t accept TriWest if they don`t want to cooperate, and said i would have to post a review of their clinic, she said she would let her manager know I threatened them. I requested on several occasions to speak with a manager who was always unavailable. I have a GI appointment tomorrow which I won`t be able to attend because the staff didn`t complete the necessary form for Triwest even at TriWest`s requests. I WOULD NOT recommend this GI Clinic especially if you are a Veteran using TriWest. Now I`m without care when i desperately need it. I have to start the process all over again & find a new GI provider! I`m on formula with miserable GI symptoms due to rare diseases & this is how this clinic treats new patients.  Update: 9/12/18: Still nothing has been accomplished & I cannot get the care I need.<12<9<2018<18<15<55

The price was totally reasonable and even though they could have charged me for moving other things in addition to the furniture that was on the quote, since they hustled and finished in the expected time it was no extra charge. That kind of integrity in a business is a huge deal. The people at this company are pros and it shows. I have nothing but good things to say about my experience with Dignity Movers.<15<11<2019<16<46<27

GgetauUV6Lzdl4t2DSX_4g<R4J6GaAsIR6PakJOnHNZVg<VsEpjrGJu8RJhreGChT7Uw<3<0<0<0<So my 1st time here and it was for a birthday celebration. The place is cute a little small but I think due to the fact its cold out it felt so small. My point it`s a roof top lounge so the doors to patio were closed so everyone was inside having drinks. Food is a small plate situation mostly. I did get to taste the lobster mac or was really good and ppl in my party enjoyed the tuna poke. Overall I would come again in the dprin/summer. The valet is 15.00 the hotel in in the epicenter so u can always park on your own plus there`s a garage across the street.<18<11<2019<17<1<49

My mother wanted to sit at the bar with the bartender but I really wanted a table so the whole family could talk with out disruption of having to tell.  The hostess was polite and seated us immediately. The server came over in a timely manner. At first she grabbed put drink orders and was polite. When it came time to ordering our meals, the server was brash and didn`t seem interested in knowing her menu.  When my sister ordered chicken wings the server ask what flavor she would like, my sister asked for the flavors, and the server pointed to the menu with her pen and said '"they are right there'". Due to the dim lighting, it was difficult to read the menu. She didn`t offer even the basics mild medium or hot. Which there were only plain medium hot garlic Parmesan and lemon pepper. If I can remember it by glancing once at it, should be expected of the server.  When the server got around to my mother, the attitude was even worse. As my mother ordered a kids portion. The server gave her a difficult time because she was ordering a kids portion. (which my mother replied, '" I get this every time we come here'" which was at least once a week) it was a solid 2minute conversation of how my mother wanted a kids meal, instead of asking the bartender for how she exactly puts the order in.   Two problems would normally over look and continue with dinner. However, by the state of North Carolina, a restaurant can not put age restrictions on their meals.  The attitude wasn`t necessary. The server gave off the sense of not wanting to be at work and was upset she had gotten us(another table)  I made the decision for us all to go to the bar in monicas area. She clearly was happy to be at her job and enjoyed speaking with people. She was also highly knowledgeable in her menu items!  Food:  Pizza was good nothing bad or exceptional about it. The wings: we`re great very meaty and just the right crisp Side salads were fresh and super crunchy Children Philly steak is my mothers favorite. Fresh potato chips  The baked potato was a bit too dry.   Overall, the experience was great, thanks to Monica and the rest of the team."<19<11<2019<12<24<11

They have gutted entire departments and are starting to invest serious cash internally in finding great talent. This is starting to reflect in the overall product of the company.  I was there when they weren`t so good and have seen changes first hand. Changes that probably should have happened years ago, but are happening nonetheless.   I`d recommend you all to at least give them another shot in the near future. These ladies and gents truly care about their craft and are improving by the day.  While GTZ has made ample mistakes I think they have learned and are positioning themselves to do great things. If you had a bad experience in the past just reach out and let them know! They are under new management now and I truly believe they will work with you and help you out.<16<7<2019<8<14<6

When in Vegas, a bad meal is a missed opportunity.  Their buffalo sauce is '"homemade,'"  but not at all what would normally pass as buffalo sauce.  This ruined the sandwich.  Furthermore, a good sandwich can be ruined with bad blue cheese dressing.  Well, here, their blue cheese looks more like cottage cheese than blue cheese.   It`s a darn shame.  Two strikes.   Can`t comment on burgers, but if you`re looking for a buffalo chicken sandwich, look elsewhere."<20<11<2019<20<26<1

My husband and I had made a reservation for 5pm and arrived at 4:55, the hostess said that it would be a few minutes and that we could sit at the bar-not a problem for us since we knew we were early. Well 5 came and past and we were still sitting at the bar, there was literally every single table open in the restaurant, so it`s not like we were waiting for someone to leave. Completely open restaurant. Another couple walk in and were immediately seated while we were still sitting at the bar (not drinking literally just sitting there waiting to be seated). The hostess then tells us we are next after she had walked by us while seating the other couple. Disappointing to be overlooked and ignored right off the bat.   Luckily after finally being seated the server promptly took our order and was very attentive throughout the meal. We ordered the meatballs to start and the filet mignon and the vodka tortellini for our meals which were  amazing. The food was very good quality for the price.   If it wasn`t for the saving grace of the food and wait staff I would have left with the bad taste in my mouth that started the visit.<16<6<2019<1<25<42

There was no line and I was in and out of there in less than 10 minutes.

So I had to try this place out.  There was a ton of people outside the restaurant when we got there, but the line kept moving so we didn`t even wait that long.  When we sat down, it took a while for our server to take our order or acknowledged us. We noticed the people who sat down after us was already being served. After meeting our server, we saw how many tables he was helping so we let it slide. He was so helpful the entire night and made sure we were taken care of, they we gave him a 30% tip!  What we ate:  1. Calamari - Hmm... The calamari had some kind of marinara sauce on the bottom of the bowl. I think to add some color. I never had them like this. The calamari became a bit to soggy since it was sopped in that sauce, but we can`t complain because it was only $5.  2. Artichoke Dip and Chips - The artichoke dip was good. The quality was like what you get from Applebee`s. I think it may have been sitting there a little too long because it didn`t look melty or cheesy. But again, $5.  3. Steak Quesadilla - My husband`s favorite. It came with a bit of sour cream, guacamole, and salsa on the side. He didn`t need it because he says it was already flavorful.  4. Cheeseburger - The cheeseburger was nice and juicy, but my only complaint would be the cheese on top. It was a perfect square so you know they took it out of that krafts clear plastic wrap and three the processed cheese on top.  5. Penne Pasta - The penne Pasta was just ok. There wasn`t much flavor in the pasta sauce. But again, only $5.  6. Steak - My husband enjoyed his steak, but didn`t really care if the veggies and mashed potatoes.  Everything was good for $5. We would definitely come back to try the other things on the menu. I think we got a little too much for two because we got judging eyes from the other tables. Lol!

It cannot be worth it. I am happy to proven wrong as of this morning. It is worth it. (Caveat: we did not have to wait more than 2 minutes for a table so I can`t speak to the 1.5+ wait times that we`ve been quoted on our two previous attempts to visit.) We arrived at 7:35 and there was no wait. By 7:41 we heard the hostess start quoting 15-20 minutes so 7:30 appears to be the sweet spot.   The menu offers something for everyone with sweet or savory, light or heavy, etc.. I ordered the breakfast tacos with chorizo and avocado. I was a bit miffed that they charge $1.75 for avocado and I only got 20% of an avocado, but that was short lived. As soon as I took my first bite I was in breakfast taco heaven. Why isn`t everyone putting hashbrowns in their breakfast tacos?! Genius. The plate was pretty big, I could only eat 1.5 of the 3 tacos. Small eaters could probably share. Also, the serrano hot sauce that came to our table was amazing. I am going to buy myself some and start putting it on everything.  My husband got a ham benedict and polished the whole thing off with a smile before moving on to the rest of my tacos, so I think it`s safe to say he liked it.   Coffee was tasty and most importantly came in a big mug with free refills.   Service was a bit slow but we weren`t in a rush and the waitress was very friendly. Will definitely return.  Pro tip: seats at the counter are first come first served, so if you see one snag it.<18<2<2017<15<27<16

mJRgT0fSY5hQbpHb49KHAg<ohAOR3uiHO2-3TcPrOLEVw<utIA0LyQmwP-9DRyxUe6qQ<3<1<1<0<Quite perplexed by the crowds at this place. The first time we attempted to go, there was a wait time of 85 minutes on a Sunday so when we had an opportunity to go during the week at 2:00 pm we took advantage of it.There was no wait and there were no crowds.   Our waiter brought me the wrong juice (I asked for cranberry and he brought me orange juice) and seemed very distracted. There were a lot of staff about moving items from the kitchen and stockroom as they were preparing to close though we weren`t rushed.   The food was not great which is why I`m perplexed about its popularity. I had three pancakes: blueberry, peanut butter cup and chocolate chip. The only one that looked and tasted good was the blueberry. I would have been livid had I waited over an hour for that meal so at least I didn`t have to wait. There was no whipped cream but instead globs of butter which I didn`t want so I pushed them off and used the syrup instead.   I also ordered a side of chicken sausage. It looked like a ground chicken patty and when I bit into it there were pieces of bone or beak that were crunchy. I complained and the waiter brought it to the manager (or I think she was the manager on duty) and she actually felt the hard crunchy pieces and came over to apologize.She told me they get them already prepared from a supplier and they would have to talk to their supplier. Needless to say they removed it from the bill.   The parking lot is small and we had to wait for someone to leave to get a spot. I would say this is nothing special and is just a small breakfast place with underwhelming food.  I prefer The Egg and I which has a better and more extensive menu. My spouse did like his French toast but it was fancy French toast with marscapone cheese as they didn`t have just regular French toast.  Not worth the wait in my opinion and I won`t be returning. Perhaps I ordered the wrong things but if a restaurant is good, there should be no wrong choices.<27<7<2017<17<15<28

I had heard there was a long wait there, and boy they weren`t kidding.  We got there around 11, and there was an hour and a half wait.  Geez.  Well alrighty then.  Lucklly Half-priced books was around the corner, so we killed plenty of time there along with walking around the rather small farmer`s market right near the entrance.  We still had a few minutes to kill when we got back from our trip, so we decided to order from the bar.  The pineapple mimosa I ordered was quite delicious and a good size too.  Unfortunately the line for the bar wasn`t quite clear, as there were several people waiting, but we made it through.  By the time our drinks were ready, our table was ready.  The menu is rather large, with an emphasis on pancakes and variations of eggs benedicts.  I settled on the pot pie with my hash browns extra crispy, as it is one of their unique signature items.  I felt like the pot pie filling was good, but there was not enough of the chicken or filling.  I was left with some dry puff pastry at the end of the meal.  The hash browns were cooked perfectly!  The service was rather mediocre, with the waitress taking a long time to get our check, and really, needed a mint.  Will come back and try some other items, as the menu looks great!<3<12<2017<21<44<42

It is a classic Mexican grocery store cum taqueria, but oh so much more   Easily top 3-5 taco joints in the county and definitely the class of the west side. At $2.50/taco and no minimum order, these are a bargain and $25-30 can easily feed a hungry family of 4.   Options for tacos include carne asada, chorizo, pollo, pastor(marinated pork); and campechano (steak/chorizo) mix.  We`ve had them all - Unless you don`t eat red meat, get the carne, chorizo or campechano. Pastor is a bit fatty and pollo is forgettable.   Pro tip - the tacos come double wrapped with corn tortillas. This throws off the ratio of soft shell to ingredients. Instead of peeling apart the often stuck together corn wrap, special order your tacos with fresh in-house made flour tortillas. Trust me, you`ll thank me.

I sent multiple requests for service and received prices all over the place with extra fees for various services.  Edan from NV Locksmith (the business owner) gave me ONE price quote and he performed the work beautifully.  It went from requesting service to new rekeyed locks in about 24 hours.  He was very easy to work with and when I asked for extra keys for my lock, he obliged with no hesitation.  He charged me EXACTLY what he quoted me for the service via Yelp and I was so happy that I gave him a little tip for being so professional.  As an out of state home owner of a rental property, it`s hard to find good contractors to do work in your absence that don`t try to upsell you.  This guy is great and I would use him again in a heartbeat!  Highly recommended!  Thank you very much Edan!<4<12<2019<23<49<28

We have been here since 6:55 pm it is now 10:01pm!!! The flight attendants that have been on the plane are rude, tired, snappy, and unpleasant.. There has been no offer of food or beverage. One attendant came through with a water bottle but ran out before she got to us and has not come back in over an hour. The last time I flew American I swore I would NEVER fly the line again... shame on me!!!  Continuation: The flight was finally canceled at 11:30. No crew ever showed up for the flight. We are now booked on a 5:40 am to Dallas to connect to Our destination of Chicago. I was able to solve our personal rebooking through DM with American on Twitter... those guys DO WORK!! Most of the other passengers can`t get out of Phoenix until late afternoon. So I`m thankful for Social Media acting on our behalf. Still the agents and flight personnel at Phoenix Sky Harbor really do lack any sort of human relations skills. Really bad!  In the morning went to gate for our 5:40 flight. No one was there!!!!! They changed the gate and didn`t tell us... it was only 10 minutes from the check-in to the gate and THEY CHaNGED the gate - these people are BOZOS - complete idiots!!!

For one, the front office NEVER answers their phones. There has been several times that I need to get ahold of the office immediately due to a bee infestation or water stopped working mid shower. These issues have no happened just once, maybe three to four other occasions. When my apartment was infested with bees, they were coming through the walls and vents. I let the office know 10+ times the issue took two months to get resolved. The front office repeatedly told me the problem was fixed however days later the bees would be back. I was not able to end my lease without having to pay the early termination fee. When I do finally get ahold of the front office, they are the least friendly individuals.

This 1 star if anything 0 star reflects on the rudest office manager I have ever met, miss Lisa Marra! She had the nastiest stuck up attitude I`ve ever dealt with in a dentist office, I was simply trying to resolve an issue I had with my insurance/ the office. I had gotten a letter from my insurance basically saying my dentist office owed me some money back. I came in looking for her last week and the nice lady in the front told me she would be in this week. I come in and ask her if she can help, grasped the papers from my hand! Made copies and with an attitude said '"I`ll get back to you In a few days'" me and my mom were like '"what'" with an expression on our faces. Miss Lisa Marra AGAIN with attitude told me and my mom (the customer) '"I`m doing payroll right now I can`t help you.!'" First of all that is NOT our problem. I came here get my money back today not in a couple of days, I want to take care of the problem TODAY not in a few days she could have spared 10 mins to just go over the letter and their receipt and simply say '"ok I see what`s going on let me give you the right amount back'". Stephanie resolved everything for me in a few minutes! Lisa could have done the same She should be watched on how she does her job and how she treats people. Stephanie should be office manager she was nice enough to explain everything to me, made me comfortable and showed me the customer service that everyone should be giving out. Thank you dr Kim for everything but I will not be returning, customer service is suppose to be your staffs number ONE priority and today Lisa Marra did not show it all, she is a nasty lady!"<13<12<2016<23<33<17

My prime rib dip was really tough, full of fat and gristle. My wife said hers was fine but did not finish. My daughters fries tasted awful, possibly old as the other fries were fine. Son`s burger was fine, nothing special, like something you would get at Red Robin, $2.00 to add small strips of bacon is ridiculous.

I did mention this has become a pattern right?  Johnny`s has been in a small plaza on the corner of Kennedy/Ellesmere for 24 years, and I have driven by hundreds of times.  Why did I not see it before?  After I read the reviews on Yelp, we finally had a chance to try it out.    JOHNNY - We walked in not knowing what to expect, and were greeted by a really nice guy.  I told him it was our first time, we heard about this place and the next thing you know, I`m asking his name.  It`s Johnny!    ORDER - We didn`t quite know what to order.  When we go somewhere new, I`m overwhelmed with choices. Johnny to the rescue!  He suggested a mixed plate for my husband, and chicken/beef shawarma combo for me so we could try different items.    SEATING - There are a few tables and counter seating so we grabbed a booth, some drinks and checked into Yelp. The place is very clean and I was surprised the ventilation was working well (no smoky or greasy fumes).  FOOD - Johnny was very gracious and offered us complimentary Zaatar (Lebanese Vegetable Pizza) and Cheese Manakish to try.  Both were garnished with onions, olives, mint, and tomatoes.  I`ve had Zaatar before, but these mini pizzas tasted so fresh!  Thank you so much Johnny!  The food was brought to us and WOW, where do I begin. The pita bread on the shawarma was perfectly grilled, with a nice crispy exterior.  It was cut in half so my husband could try it.  The chicken and beef slices were crusty on the outside and succulent, perfectly seasoned and tender.  The hummus was fresh, and I could definitely taste the garlic paste that was brushed on the inside of the pita.  It wasn`t overpowering though. The pickled vegetables and tabbouleh added a nice crunch and slight bitterness/tang to balance out the flavors.  The fries were fresh cut and meaty, no skimpy fries here!  The mixed plate also came with a grilled pita bread with garlic paste, rice with lentils, potatoes, tabbouleh, hummus and pickled vegetables.     PAYMENT -  Before we left, we asked where to put our plates and one of the staff said to leave them on the table.  You can pay with cash, debit or credit card; however, the tip function is not on the machine.  There is a cup on the counter, so I would highly encourage everyone to tip.  This is truly a family run business that shows a lot of pride in their food and customer service.    OVERALL - We had a fantastic meal and felt like guests who never leave your home hungry!  Johnny thanked us for stopping by and even kindly mentioned that sometimes when we`re driving, we`re focused on where we`re going, so it`s easy to miss his restaurant.  I thought that was so thoughtful of him to say. This is definitely our favorite shawarma place!  PRICES - Shawarma Plate - $11.99 Wrap, fries and pop - $10.49"<6<5<2019<15<23<36

We visited as a group on a team event and had a reservation on a Monday night.  upon arriving, we were seated promptly and out table was ready and set up.   I am not sure what is the theme of the restaurant but it was really cool I would describe it as something related to Halloween with skulls and cat skeletons. I really enjoyed looking at the little details on the decorations on the way to the restrooms in the basement.   The menu  adheres to the theme with funny drink and food names. I settled for a wheat beer from the craft list which was pretty standard.  For the main meal I had the steak sandwich with poutine.  I cannot say either the sandwich or the poutine were remarkable but they were  good enough.  The restaurant also offers drinks to share (What I would refer to as a fish bowl) and we ordered the one that comes in a darth vader helmet. The drink is some fruity  rum punch but it gets delivered with a show of lights and sounds and dry ice which was the highlight of the evening.  We really enjoyed our time at storm crow manor and were able to play some board games to keep the night interesting. I would definitely recommend it for team events and drinks but maybe grab dinner somewhere else?<4<12<2019<22<5<52

The venue itself is small with a floor (standing) area and two additional seating tiers. There were several bars set up but several drinks we tried to order, they did not have. The concert was great and the music was crisp and clear. Once the crowd started dancing and jumping, you could feel the ground moving. Not sure if this is the way it was design but definitely threw us off guard a bit. Overall, this venue is nice.

His suggestions were invaluable in getting the best job for the best price and the guys that did the work were super as well . We would recommend Adams to anyone needing pool work<3<8<2019<19<49<41

Then the very yummy royal curry (yellow curry) with chicken and boyfriend got the drunken noodles with beef. They don`t joke around with they spice numbers he got a 4 which he liked but a little to hot for me luckily I was able to wash it down with my Thai ice tea to help with the burn.

I went in to buy a wig, asked Daniel to help me. He immediately said I can only try on three. I told him I was aware of their policy. I tried on one. I shed to try another one and he says.. '"okay that`s two'". I told him that if I just tried on on one, that I know I`m at two. I told him that he should be a little nicer when working with the public and I was done. When I was checking out, there was a lady in front of me telling the manager how rude the guy was to me. The manager never said anything. I told her as well, she acted as if she was bothered.  I went to the Craig store at 7:40 pm and the security officer told me they were closed. I begged him to let me in because I know they close at 8:00. He said no and walked away."<4<8<2019<20<19<44

I saw a picture of the breakfast pizza in Charlotte Agenda`s newest brunch article and was totally intrigued.  We got there around 11am and had an hour wait which is pretty good IMO. Probably after a little over an hour, we went to ask and they were able to sit us outside but I wish they would called our name earlier if that was available.   We ordered the beignets and pimento cheese as apps. The beignets were too dense for my taste (very cake like) but I liked the jam. The pimento was fantastic and had very good flavor. That was the good part.  I got the breakfast pizza, the gf got the eggs benedict and her nephew got the kids '"grass-fed'" hamburger. If you are going to put grass fed on a kids menu, I sort of expect to see a nicer hamburger come out. I cook grass fed beef all the time and just hoped to see better regardless of the designation or not. The first one was cold and tiny -- like half the bun. We had to ask for a new one and the next one was warmer but not much better looking. My gf liked her benedict but her breakfast potatoes were cold. Now, my pizza was edible as I was also pretty hungry but it was pretty lackluster. It just lacked flavor and was lukewarm with halfway melted cheese.  I read some of the older reviews before coming about the service and I thought our server was pretty decent besides clearing our table from our excess mimosa glasses. I just thought the food could`ve been a lot better and that`s usually my criteria for returning. Based on other reviews, I`m definitely tempted to return and give it another shot at least for dinner but time will tell."<21<7<2019<18<46<14

MgOn0IV4pyFoi2lYAx4u3w<WXDj6mmyrJi5q5nHKJ6H7w<FB4qtiB4--kt_PqPSowJTA<5<14<8<12<Very nice new AYCE sushi spot located at Sunset and Rainbow on the Northwest corner. I have been here 7 times now and can`t wait to come back again! For discounts read below for the second tip!  Tip 1: For the month of April-2019 they are giving a discount on AYCE lunch and dinner!  I think they set themselves apart from other AYCE sushi restaurants by providing a much larger variety of menu items as well as as much dessert as you can eat ;-). They boast 32 appetizer items and some of my favorite include the cucumber salad, ahi poki salad, udon, coconut shrimp (so good and sweet this could be included as a dessert), gyoza, and the skewers oh my, who doesn`t love bacon wrapped anything, but the bacon wrapped asparagus is a must, and while you`re at it, try the bacon wrapped scallop.  It`s nice to find an AYCE sushi spot who doesn`t try to load your nigiri up with rice so you get full! Their nigiri is done right, small amount of rice and a proper amount of fish atop. My wife dislikes sashimi sized portions so this place rocks in her book! Many of the sushi rolls here you can order in a half size (4 pieces as opposed to 8) which gives you an opportunity to try even more each visit. We have tried over 20 rolls, too many to list but do try the Dr. Roll, 007, Dragon, Tiger and if you can handle heat, the No Cry Amigo. Hot green tea is good. If you ware in the mood for cocktails, try their sake, the strawberry Nigori unfiltered. For dessert, since its AYCE, why not try all the mochi and the Hawaiian Honey bread?  Tip 2: When there is not a monthly price special going on, they offer 10% discount to medical professionals with badge or in uniform, police, firefighters, military / veteran and in uniform, Clark County teachers with badge or license, casino workers and even Uber and Lyft drivers!<22<4<2019<5<55<32

Not only was it huge, it had a Starbucks a Pizza Hut and the parking lot is well lit, safe and parking is plentiful.  It reminded me of an airport parking lot.  The lines were short. Lots of self service stalls.  This Target had friendly associates around and ready to help you find anything that you need, and get you help quickly.            They have an outdoor eating area that looks incredibly European.  It`s situated on an upstairs balcony/patio that gives you a lovely birds eye view of this gorgeous Queen City.

saedLrY1FPba1_mhPou7Aw<sq0qvPb5g5Se_W0OaPybvg<9vij1n-WqXnnEsgzmwnoXg<1<15<7<7<Please see my glowing of this restaurant on 4/13/2013.   So I am on the Eastside for a meeting and in the mood for a good lunch. This place has good food.   I walk to the counter, order a shwarma pita and a coke to go. Pay my $9.27 and throw the change into the tip jar. I am told to sit on the to go bench and wait for order. I thought, odd, 3/4 empty restaurant and I have to crowd onto the bench. O well, no biggie. Wait for my order handed the sandwich and I change my mind. Sit down at one of 15 empty tables to eat and the snotty cashier barks at me across the room that next time if I am going to stay I have to order it to stay. I said pardon me, why does it matter, she responds, those are our rules. I state, there will not be a next time. I then place my uneaten sandwich and coke on the counter and walk. One of the managers catches my eye, waves me over. I ask him if I am welcome to eat in his restaurant.   He states that they have rules because of the liquor board. I am stunned by his illogical statement. I was not drinking alcohol, so what does the liquor board have to do with my pita and coke. He offers nothing. I say, ok I understand, turn and leave. Walk across the parking lot to Jimmy Johns to order another lunch (far inferior in quality) stand and wait. Then the snotty cashier shows up and tries to give me ten dollars. I say I do not want the money, she argues. I ask her why she is harassing me. She continues to argue with me. I tell her to leave me alone. Bizarre.   A little bit of feedback for the owners.   1. You can not get in trouble with anyone if you are not breaking the law. It is not against the law to eat food out of to go containers in restaurants.   2. The reason your dining room was not packed at noon is because of your lame service.   3. I will never return even though I really dig your food.<2<4<2015<4<23<45

He just recently relocated to this store because the other store got broken into. Everything is shipped from Korea and he picks them up from Long Beach himself. He said he keeps the prices comparable to Korea. Some face masks are 99¢ and the Tony Moly masks are just $2.99 compared to $3.75 at Ulta.  He gave us a discount card for our next visit.

Their decorations (and merchandise) starts before you even get in, with potted plants on the front end- for decoration and sale. Walking in, they have everything stocked, clean, and nicely arranged.  Fresh area was very well stocked (on a Saturday night?! It never looks this nice, anywhere!) and the floors were clean. Not just basic mopping and waxing, but no debris, messes, clearly these people not only have an attention to maintenance, but they clean as they go. They either care, or there are consequences for associates not giving a poop.  Everything in the store was in stock, and I didn`t notice a thing out.

It sounded good so I hopped in the car to give it a try!  When I walked in I was greeted by the three people behind the counter.  I explained that it was my first time in and asked some questions.  They were very kind and helpful and I decided to try their create your own poke bowl.    First I chose a base, I went with white rice but there`s also brown rice and spring mix.  Then it was time to choose my protein, they have both plain and pre-seasoned options.  Since I`m a spice wuss I chose to go with the plain tuna (although they did point out several pre-seasoned non spicy options).  You get two scoops of protein and can mix and match or stick with one choice.  This time I stuck with tuna, but next time I`m sure I`ll do salmon too.  Then they tossed my protein and cucumbers with the sauce of my choice.  I went with their house sauce which was described as a less salty and sweet soy sauce.  I really liked it!    After your base and protein you can choose your toppings and this part had lots of fun choices!  I went with seaweed salad, krab, masago, edamame, green onions, avocado and some fried garlic for a crunch.  They were out of the fried onions otherwise I`d have gone for them.    The whole time I was ordering the staff was friendly and helpful and seemed to enjoy their job.  As I checked out they explained their frequent buyer club and I decided to sign up.  Basically, you buy 9 bowls/burritos and you get the 10th for free.  I took my bowl home and was excited to give it a try because it looked so good!  Well, it tasted as good as it looked and I have a feeling hubby and I will be regulars.<10<7<2019<22<20<36

They do have a drive-thru which I`ve never used and I`ve always wondered if going though the drive-thru would be faster than going inside and waiting in line.

wloX4kvwaOBsvuuNxMkjXA<E-68NC80DkJEoB8EB5umEg<gP4raKtiXFZ_p3Bn9ESTIw<5<3<0<2<I just recently moved to this area and have been looking for a new place to get massages - and I definitely found it!   I have had MANY massages in my life and one of the best I ever had was at Hand and Stone Spa - with Jeff.  When I called to book my appointment I asked for someone who is really good with deep tissue. I am always hesitant to go to a new place because sometimes their idea of deep tissue and my idea of deep tissue are different.   Jeff is the best! He is very talented and knows the body and how and where you carry your tension - and when you leave that tension is gone. I have a lot of tension in my shoulders. With some massages I have had, the massage therapist has their routine that they go through and they don`t focus on the areas where you need it. I really appreciate it when they focus on the parts of my body that really need the work - and that is exactly what Jeff did.   He would quietly ask me how the pressure was and how I was doing but other than that he let me relax and enjoy the massage.   He is very talented. While I was having my massage I was already thinking about the Yelp review I was going to write - and I rarely write reviews - but I wanted to get the word out about my great experience.   The spa itself is very clean and inviting. I was told that each of the massage therapists have their own style so they can match you with the therapist that is right for you. But keep in mind Jeff can adjust the pressure to what is right for you!  Make an appointment and go and see him!<3<2<2017<3<53<7

A mistake on my end!  This place was fantastic, loved the atmosphere, some delicious drink options and an excellent selection of culinary delights.  Normally I would order tacos while I was at a taco bar but their Cuban sandwich was calling my name.  Very happy with my choice, managed to substitute the pickles for jalapenos and it was one of the best Cubans I`ve ever eaten.  Only thing I wasn`t much a fan of was the (I believe) Brazilian cheesy bread, might have been the yuca flour but the consistency wasn`t my cup of tea.  Will definitely be going back when I`m in the mood for tacos!<11<8<2019<0<58<24

But yesterday was our last meal here. The restaurant was more crowded than usual, and when the waitress took our order, she said it would take 20 minutes to come. Not what we wanted to hear with 2 rambunctious and hungry grandsons with us. The booth was set for 2, and we had to ask twice for more chopsticks, napkins and water.  There was almost nothing left in the bottle of soy sauce on our table. We had to request the little dishes for the soy. When most of the food came (my daughter`s sushi arrived long after), it was definitely not as good as usual. My husband left half his meal, saying the sushi was dry and tasted like it had been sitting out. He told the waitress he couldn`t eat it because it didn`t seem fresh. She said, well you ate some of it. He showed her the pieces in question, the skin and sinew left on 2 of them, and was given a token apology. When the bill came, we were charged the full amount. After he wouldn`t pay the full amount, since nothing was offered to replace the part he didn`t eat, a new bill came with 50% taken off his dish. This is no way to treat anyone, but especially not regulars. Sushi places are ubiquitous in Toronto. No need to return to places that don`t give good service and the freshest fish, even on a busy night.<21<8<2019<14<25<48

If you cant tell by the hundred different paint marks on the poorly placed pole at the entrance of the drive thru, you will then realize when you try to squeeze the turn that youre most likely hitting the curb on the left, or pole on the right.  This has been like this for years, never fixed. This place is very reluctant to rely on tourist traffic. Im a local and Im not coming back here because of this horribly designed drive thru that damages peoples cars. Im sure it hurts their business, but then again im sure the franchise owner couldnt care less like most typical franchise owners.  Park up if you want coffee. Thats all I can say.<22<8<2019<19<2<27

I requested for a bigger table but the waitress won`t heed. Thus, when our appetizer ( we ordered a sampler) and 3 entrees arrived ( Phad Thai, Panang curry, BBQ Chicken and Cat Fish) we don`t have a space !!! Again, I requested for a bigger table and that`s the only time  the waitress who was talking Thai to the other cashier accommodated our request. Irked with the waitress attitude and vapid taste of their food except for the panang, we left not barely touching their Phad Thai.

Being in CA, it`s hard for me to think of  what to send him for his birthday.  Normally I do flowers but I wanted something different and immediately thought of a nice dessert.  I called to inquire about the cupcakes and the woman that helped me mentioned I should order online as the delivery charge was almost $15 more over the phone.  So all you reviewers or readers, order online!  The cupcakes were on sale so it was my lucky day as I ordered 8 different types to which my overall total was about $35 dollars with the delivery.  I thought it was pretty inexpensive as I didn`t have to do a damn thing except click my mouse a few times. Type here and there.  Oh, don`t be like me and not think- if you want to do a delivery for a birthday then make sure you write in the special instructions to include a card or something fitting for the occasion!  I didn`t think because usually there is a gift wrap option or something like that but I didn`t think when I hit the `pay now`.  Even though I ordered late at night, I still get to choose a morning delivery for no additional charge and they delivered in the morning between 9-12pm time I opt for.  The packaging wasn`t cute or fancy to my disappointment but it`s okay, the thought the counts right?  4 stars for easy order and delivering!  Remember- special instructions lovelies!<24<2<2016<4<20<4

Do NOT use this office for anything! Like the other reviews state, once you give him your money, you`re finished! No communication, missed important deadlines, and he filed incomplete documents causing me much trouble. In fact, after correcting several of his errors, I fired him and hired another attorney. His attitude reflects that which clearly shows he has no respect at all for his clients, especially those filing BK, as he verbally expressed to me personally during a brief conversation. In this very trying time, you will need clear guidance, honesty, and support from your attorney. Scott Forrester does NOT provide any of these things. More trouble will follow if you hire him. Hire someone else. There are other reviews here that provide great information on BK attorneys that are much more professional. Hire one of them instead and protect yourself! You are ultimately responsible for the outcome of your BK. Remember that.<16<4<2019<20<2<9

She enjoyed it.  My wife ordered a bowl of the matzoh ball soup, which she declared to be one of the best she`s ever had:  large, fluffy matzoh ball; light broth; plenty of noodles and veggies.

With Gyro`s the bread needs to be grilled with a little olive oil for 30-45 seconds or more to give it a little flavor. On this occasion, the pita was soft and warm and not grilled. The sandwich started coming apart since the bread was raw, and the dressing made it a lot worse.    I grabbed a fork and started eating it that way since I could not hold it, due to it being mushy. I noticed someone else with the same problem. I went to the counter and told her and she simply said she was sorry, but that`s it. Twice in a month. I thought it was a simple mistake, but apparently, that`s the way they are doing it now. There are plenty of other places that sell this type of greek food.

I, however, am also on the quest to find the best veggie burger out there so due to how they described their version of it, I ended up getting that instead of a conventional one!   [The Veggie] $15.50 - This is basically the veggie version of a regular burger. It`s got all the regular fixings of a normal one such as cheese, burger sauce, lettuce, tomato, onion and pickles! Obviously, if you`re not a fan of any of those items, they are listed so tell your waiter/waitress ahead of time if that`s the case. Every burger/sandwich comes with two sides that you can choose! I chose the fries and because I love mashed potatoes, I had to try their variation of it which was the jalapeno cheddar mashed potatoes. They were delicious and also came with a side of gravy that I ended up using for my fries more than anything! The fries also came with a delicious dill dip that I couldn`t get enough of! The mashed potatoes were already extremely flavorful because of the cheddar cheese so they didn`t need the gravy at all. The veggie patties, themselves, were very thin so the fact that it was double stacked actually meant that the overall thickness of both patties cumulatively ended up being the regular thickness of a beef patty. The patties are made out of black beans and other veggies they don`t list. Regardless, I really thoroughly enjoyed it!   [Dirt Pie] $6.00 - I normally am not a huge fan of chocolate desserts because I often get sick of chocolate very quickly and very easily. Somehow, this dessert, despite being a '"chocolate & mocha mix of ice cream with fudge brownie chunks and a crumbled cookie crust,'" it was very scrumptious and I ate all of it and actually found myself wishing I could come back to eat it again! I loved this dessert and did not find its chocolatey-ness overwhelming probably because of the various flavors I kept tasting with each bite. I highly recommend this dessert if you`re a fan of chocolate~   Overall, a very pleasant place to have a catch-up lunch with a friend I hadn`t seen in a couple of months! Our glasses of water were refilled many times but always with a smile as our waitress was very friendly, and personable.

sVRI2_n2-nHaBqKNFiC9Og<E_GAXhVA1_lVC2aFpMQElA<3fdtp-bzoE4ZgTakkcEBzQ<4<1<1<1<Las Vegas is indeed a place that is worth experiencing. Is it a place I would want to live? No. Since I first went to Las Vegas in the early 90`s I have seen this town which seemed rough around it`s glamorous edges turn into a decent sized city. But with the delight of growing also comes growing pains.  Personally I think traffic in Las Vegas is God awful. Not only are the roads seem ill maintained and in need of being expanded but the way people drive is nothing short of inconsiderate or even cautious. Perhaps it is resident`s of Las Vegas and Nevada that feel like they need to drive this way to deal with incompetent tourist drivers. Whatever the case may be I can leave it. Denver drivers don`t drive like this!  Eating out I found out can be a gamble too. Some places that charge an arm an a leg only put out sub par casino food. The Strip is especially guilty of this. I did find that if you do wonder off The Strip not too far then you can find some good places. Just avoid the places that will bring in tourists. Of course there are always exceptions to the rule. As Vegas has grown it has brought in many more people for at one time had a booming casino and recreation scene which made the city so big practically overnight! When the economy tanked so did the casinos and now Nevada`s unemployment is worse than Michigan`s! Of course there are pros to Vegas the amazing concerts, night shows and acts that they rake in. Shopping is no slouch either! Stores that are not seen unless you live on either coast seem common place here and are an exciting treat to us Midwesterners. Those pros in of itself earns Vegas it`s four stars out me. The cons are worth it if you don`t get into an accident or anything of the sort. Vegas`s glitz and glam is infectious but it wears off fast. It is like having Halloween or Christmas decorations up too long. The glitz wears a bit thin and then wears you out. The hotels are themed of places that are somewhere else and eventually become transparent after being bowled over by the showiness at first glance. Of course this is all from my own point of view and some people don`t mind it all and want daily doses of glitz for the rest of their lives. More power to them! Not me, it isn`t a good fit for me but that doesn`t mean I don`t enjoy visiting after my injection of glitz and glam  from the previous visit wears off.<27<9<2012<19<45<37

Take car to be washed at Autobell at Piper station drive at 12:00pm. Car come out of the wash with both of the trim on top blown off. The guys at the car wash never say anything to my wife 4 of them proceed to put it back on themselves. Further damaging the trim pieces and putting a ding on my wife`s new car. Tim (the last say) O`Neal claims his car wash couldn`t have been at fault and because he is Tim (the last say) O`Neal he has his guy write up a report not taking responsibility for the damage. I`ve read previous yelp and google posts and Tim (the last say) O`Neal has told others whose vehicles have been damaged the exact same thing he told me. '"Dry rot and pollen caused it.'" '"It was already like that before it came in.'" '"Can you prove it was us?'" I called their home office twice and requested a call from the regional manager. No one ever called. We went to the Land Rover dealership and they said Tim and his crew shouldn`t have tried to reinstall those parts without a latter and the proper tools. The parts are $550, but the labor is crazy! Autobell could have settled this for $550 and an apology, but they chose to waste out time, blame it on the vehicle (like they have done in previous yelp and google posts), and lose $53.52 month, which is what we have paid every month since 2013 for the unlimited washes. I believe Tim (the final say O`Neal thinks it`s over because he heard nothing from us last week. Wrong. I`m filing in small claims court this week. I`m going to get the car fixed pay that crazy high labor cost, and I`m also filing a complaint with the better business bureau. Autobell has insurance for any damage their equipment or people cause, and they shouldn`t let the local manager decide if a claim will be paid or not. They also shouldn`t also the local managers to work with customers when it comes to something as delicate as car damage. The associates at the car eases should immediately confer with the owner and ask the owner if it`s ok to perform any type of fixes or repairs to people`s vehicle. Luckily my wife got it all on video. I honestly thought Tim and I were going to fight. That`s how heated things got. I recorded the conversation as well. So, for future reference don`t allow these (I`m the final say) managers at autobell tell you that you have no recourse. I`ll post how this situation ends. Thanks.  5.3.2019 - Going to get car repaired tomorrow. Whatever the cost is what we will be asking for in our small claims court filing on Monday. Win, or lose we need to stop allowing their equipment to damage our vehicles with no recourse. Make them use that insurance and repair the damage. They`re counting on you to just say '"screw it'" and just never come back. Sue em if they damage your car people! I`ll let you know how this court case goes. Thanks."<4<5<2019<4<25<5

Decadent, creamy gourmet chocolate with vanilla, cinnamon, and a dash of chile?  This is the ice cream version, and so gorgeous I could not devour it fast enough.  Platano: Bananas foster, complete with homemade caramel and Anejo Rum.  Chunky bananas, blended with the sweet and spicy flavors of the rum and caramel - absolutely phenomenal!  Zarzamora: Blackberry and Lavender.  Aromatic, tangy and sweet, calming, and just beautiful.  Fresa Con Crema: Strawberries and Cream.  Tasted like I had whipped up a batch of strawberries with fresh whipped cream and sugar.  Superb!  I recommend this as a wonderful stop after dinner for dessert.  There is plenty of seating inside and out, to sit back and relax and enjoy the flavor explosion."<17<1<2012<17<43<48
bwwa1xx0PWgONecBiuefAA<3ydWageB6JAYZAM-IFwoOA<sPb0wqy6GbOo0VjqtoNwjg<2<2<3<0<My husband and I were in this store yesterday around 11 AM. The store was absolutely FREEZING. I was actually shivering even though I was wearing long pants and a long sleeved top. We couldn`t get out of the store fast enough and ended up not getting everything we needed. My husband checked us out so I could go and stand outside in the sun to warm up.  Speaking of checking out, there were no checkstands staffed with cashiers. The only option was to self check. This seems to be the direction they are going in. Well, guess what Walmart, if you want me to self check my own groceries you had better be willing to give me a 5% discount for doing so. Otherwise I will be looking for other grocery store options with checkstands that are staffed.  Also, the last two times we have been in the store there were no small boxes (75 tissues) of 3-ply Kleenex. The shelf was empty on both occasions. Maybe we will just buy our Kleenex at Costco from here on in.  The fact is their shelves are never fully stocked even though they have dozens of contractors stocking the shelves. Clearly something is not working.  Finally, their women`s bathroom was disgusting. It needs to be completely re-done. There is no hot water!  A truly miserable and uncomfortable shopping experience.<25<1<2019<16<31<19

The gravy that was all over it was really watered down and didn`t have a whole lot of flavor.

It was on the small side for the price point, but definitely lived up to the hype in terms of quality.  Meatballs were a great texture and perfectly seasoned, the red sauce was plentiful and very tasty, lots of cheese, and a quality Mancini roll.  Also got the soup of the day, which I *think* they described as '"chili and rice'".  I didn`t find any rice, but that`s not a complaint--it was a very hearty chili, chock full of beef and several different kind of beans, with a balanced flavor and a nice kick of heat.  Maybe a little too spicy for some, actually, but just right for me.    Finally, the owners were super friendly and accommodating, so will be happy to keep supporting this great local restaurant!"<15<1<2019<1<23<39

ji_5GEmn-60hzzgfrzbA4Q<yZ-vbhFPnhInlnxxEQyVdw<fbbO2vNsYPhi11Se7T95lQ<4<25<18<22<"Solid high class business hotel in the heart of downtown Calgary.  Stayed here on the very last night of our 9 day Canadian Rockies trip.  Unlike where we stayed the previous 3 nights, at the 100 year old Fairmont Banff Springs and Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise, this was not an historic hotel, but a modern business hotel.      20 story skyscraper hotel with interior corridors.  Calgary has long cold harsh winters, so no balconies, except for the corner suites for the fat cats!    Our room on the 3rd floor faced the river, and away from the traffic on the streets below.  We were too low to see the river, and had a close view of the building roofs of nearby buildings, hemmed in by even taller skyscrapers, marred by smoke from late summer forest fires.    Two queen beds, with a large window, strong AC, multi prong electrical outlets right on the desk, 40+'" flat screen HD cable TV, free and stable wifi, electronic safe, mini refrigerator, but no microwave.  Expensive looking furniture, elegant floor fixtures and lamps.    Spacious room, with dresser, counter space, night stands, sitting chair, daytime and blackout curtains, bath robes, deep bathtub.  Large bathroom has 1970s sink countertop type, instead of granite.    Very comfortable bed, easy to fall asleep, with minimal outside noise.    Did not get a chance to use the indoor heated pool, nor the fitness center.    Large lobby area to wait for rooms, business center to print out boarding tickets, multiple conference rooms, several pricey restaurants on ground floor -your business picks up the tab!   Inexpensive $1.75 CAD soda machine on ground floor.    Exemplary service by all uniformed hotel employees, who were approachable, friendly, knowledgeable, courteous, and went out of their way to be helpful, even to me in my T-shirt, shorts and sandals.     Walked 4 blocks and 10 minutes to the Eau Claire Mall.  The buffet breakfast was not part of our stay, so ate breakfast at Horton`s across the street, lunch at the Spaghetti factory 3 blocks away, and dinner at Joey Eau Claire 4 blocks away.    Walked a mile to Glenbow Museum.  Wanted to see the Military Museums, but no easy transportation to get there, 4 miles away, taxi $26 CAD before tip.  No Yelp in Calgary.   Standard rooms run about $140 USD in low season October, but soar up to $432 USD during the Calgary Stampede in July.  Interior pedestrian walkways connecting to other buildings across the street, handy in the long harsh snowy winters.   Would stay here again,  preferably during the international fireworks convention displays in late August, 2018.  A 1pm checkout arranged in advance by our tour group, prior to our ride to the airport, so that we wouldn`t get thrown out on the street at 11:01am!"<5<10<2017<2<38<55

Last month had to go on business and my company put me up at the Palms (no choice). I drove to the MGM for dinner and to gamble. Pulled up to Valet and went in. When it was time to leave, I gave my claim check to the valet attendant and she said '" that will be $16.00. I said '"what'"?  They charged me $16 bucks to park. I will eat at the Palms next time and save the parking fee. In fact, it will be a cold day in hell before I go back to the MGM. I`m sick of their crap with all of the new '"resort fees, parking fees and now drink service charge fees'". On top of all that, the whole feel of the Grand is different. They took out the lions, the rainforest cafe, took out one Starbucks, it just felt cheesey in there. Quite honestly I get everything comped when I stay there but really thinking twice now before I book the Grand again. VIVA LAS VEGAS!"<10<9<2019<22<1<5

And their press job? What press job. The bottom shirt tail is folded over on itself and there are wrinkles in a half dozen places. 2.99 for each laundered shirt and 8 for dry clean. They put some kind of tissue paper in the sleeves of the dry clean shirt after pressing and it causes the shirts to lay weird on the hanger which creates creases in the body of the shirt... doesn`t look freshly pressed.   This was actually my most underwhelming experience of the local dry cleaners yet!   Don`t waste your money on this.<14<4<2018<4<18<7

Three employees just look at me. I ask again. Not a word is spoken. Stone looks on their faces. Weird. Then one guy without saying a word to me pics up the phone and says. Someone wants to talk to you. Ask for my last name and then hangs up. I wait ten minutes. 15 minutes. Not once did anyone say anything to me. Very very rude and very unprofessional.

I booked the party bus for only 8 people and even though it was pretty big for our group size, we still appreciated all the space around us for our things and just moving around. There are cup holders behind the seats so you don`t have to hold your cup the whole time. Christen was our driver and she was super nice! She texted me about an hour before pickup to confirm everything and let me know where she will be parked. She provided us a cooler with ice to put our alcohol in. You can connect your phone via Bluetooth to play music too! I was just expecting the bus to drive around until dropoff, but she offered to take us to the '"Welcome to Las Vegas'" sign where this lady with a bright light stick helps you take great night photos of you and your crew (gotta tip her tho ofc). You can make as many stops as you want within the allotted time, which was nice. We got to stop by our hotel to drop off stuff and pee. You pay everything, including driver gratuity, ahead of time so you don`t have to worry about anything night of and can just have fun.

If you`re planning on parking here you`d have to stalk the people at the restaurant and await their return to their vehicles, so you could take over their parking spots.   They`re food is pretty good, the variety of meats and seasoning they put keep people coming back for more.  I just feel like at time this place gets disorganized with their customer service.  I had a couple of orders didn`t come so I had to check with the waiter to see where it went. I also had another order just come completely late to the point we`ve already finished our meal.

Meanwhile I look around and there are less than 10 patrons in the restaurant that seats close to 100 for dining. So I walk away and go somewhere else.

So she came across Elements and she called me and said call this number ask for Leticia everything has been taken care of, my aunt lives out of state. I call to set up my appointment the girl I spoke to on the phone was really nice. I showed up today and I walk in and I am immediately greeted, I had a couple forms I had to fill out, she offered me water with fresh strawberries, there were chocolates sitting at the table. What I liked is they have a photo album type of book on the table and it tells you a little about each therapist which I found cool. I have such a bad short term memory but the girls in the front were so nice very personable. My therapist Leticia greeted me, led me into the room sat down with me asked about my health, what type of pressure and if I wanted full body or upper only. I opted for full body light touch because I do not know how my fibromyalgia will react. She explained to me how to lay down etc she left the room, cane back and the massage started. Her pressure was perfect and she checked in on me to make sure it was ok. She was very nice as well, and seemed to genuinely care. Overall I thought it was a great experience. If my fibromyalgia reacts the way I`m hoping and this helps me I definitely will come back and do the monthly membership and definitely to see Leticia again!<8<6<2018<2<10<3

I asked if the bucket was supposed to be filled to the top, and this person said '"we don`t do that here.'"  My wife took it over to the manager at customer service and asked if that is '"how they do popcorn here.'"  Manager apologized and made it right, so at least there`s that saving grace.

I have several issues:  1) I had to wait 3 weeks for a haircut and she expected me to read her whole website and remember everything on it.  If this is not a normal haircut, and if there`s a special procedure to prepare for it, then stress it or at least throw in a little something at the end of your appointment confirmation email.   Now I get it, I got there and my hair was in a bun so it wasn`t ready to be dry cut, so I did (unintentionally) waste her time but I also wasted mine too.  I needed my hair cut for a wedding I was going to that weekend, so I felt bad for her but I was also pissed I wouldn`t have a haircut in time for this special occasion. She was so passively aggressively rude and took no responsibility for at least the fact that since I`m a new client, she didn`t remind me to do this whole 3 week prep for the cut.  She wanted me to feel bad and then tells me '"you didn`t read my website? I just paid so much money to get it redone'".   Ummmm - IDC about how much you spent - who is really going to sit there and read it all. and then says '"oh well I guess every now and then there is always that one...'"  Just piling on, like I didn`t feel bad enough.   I just wanted to go to a hair salon for curly hair - AND at normal salons they wash your hair first! Sorry, I would think most people wouldn`t automatically know that which is why I would`ve appreciated her at least throwing in a small comment like - BTW, since you are new to the salon, please be sure to read my website and make sure you are prepared for the haircut'", when she approved and confirmed my appt. It would`ve taken less than 30 seconds and saved us both time.   2)  She asked if I use deva curl products exclusively, and I told her I use the devacurl gel and that`s the only product I put in my hair. I make my own shampoo and conditioner and its all natural so I didn`t even think that that would be an issue because I`m all about being natural and being in control of what is being put in it.  Its literally glycerin, tea tree, ylang ylang, and lavender.  She went on this whole rant about water soluable products and how we shouldn`t be using oils.. blah blah. she made me feel like shit, like I didn`t do my research and know what I`m talking about. Like I haven`t been doing this for years!   I knew she was full of it and so I just let her talk and she was talking to me like I was a moron.  Long story short - I bought the no poo and one conditioner and guess what - it contains (peppermint) oil, grapeseed, glycerin etc because - its A CLEANSER AND GLYCERIN AND OILS (not all) ARE GOOD FOR THE HAIR, especially curly hair that needs MOISTURE.  She kept saying moisture is water and a bunch of other stuff that I just let her sit there any say because I was so shocked that her tone was this rude, especially to a new client, and I didn`t feel like sitting there an debating with her about how everything I make for myself is actually really great and a lot of other people use it and tell me the same thing and that water can be very damaging to hair, that`s why you aren`t even supposed to wash your hair everyday.   3) Then, when I was trying to reschedule the appt, she was like do you want to buy the products and I said yes, since thats how I am supposed to '"prepare for the cut and get all product out of my hair'". I asked her if she had bigger sizes, she said no and I said '"you know what, forget it.  If this is what I`m supposed to  be using from now on, I might as well buy the bigger sizes'", and she looked at me like she wanted to kick my a**.  I am not sure why she got so offended, I was not rude or anything because I was still in a state of shock and felt really bad.  4) Lastly, a week before my 2nd appt, she emails me to confirm my appt. Something she didn`t do that last time, so I thought that was weird.  I didn`t respond because I honestly wanted to waste her time and planned to now show up anyway that day. Anywho, the very next day, she writes me and tells me that the appt is no longer available.  If I were just busy and hadn`t gotten to it or seen it yet, I would`ve been pissed!  If I actually cared and planned on going, a day is not long enough to give someone who waited another 3 weeks for an appt. And she only emailed me that once, she didn`t stress that she needed a response asap, and she didn`t call me or anything, which is probably a better, quicker way to get a response don`t you think?   Also she didn`t even include a comment (not even a passive aggressive one) about how to not forget to be prepared for this special cut.    I think she`s unprofessional, a terrible communicator, the opposite of '"Joy-ful'", and I`m glad I didn`t get my haircut by her. I left there feeling like crap and did not appreciate it."<19<9<2019<17<30<33

Manager (owner?) went out of his way to explain that they are committed to using natural products, free of preservatives and corn syrup whenever possible.   My husband enjoyed his sandwich on the first try. He got the Bingo on a French roll (actual meat; actual cheese)  I got a pretty basic vegan sandwich (chicken, turkey, lettuce, tomato, and Swiss) on a sourdough roll, but realized the bread was denser and chewier than I would have liked and that I was looking for something a little bolder. This was my fault as I picked it, but the manager wouldn`t allow me to leave without LOVING my sandwich, so he insisted on making me a new one. This time: vegan Paparazzi. This one was bold indeed, sweet and spicy, and on a nice soft French roll.  I would go back, if not just to support this guy and his commitment to his business.

I was on my way to Dallas for the weekend, and I had already made a Mani Pedi appointment for me and my daughter in Dallas but the earliest appointment they had was 12 noon. My daughter said that was too late. I agreed because we would have spent half the day waiting to get our nails polished. So I, (with my smart self) decided to look at my Yelp app to see who was near me and had the best reviews. And for the first time in a while I saw 4 stars. It was 5:45p when I called, the excited man on the phone said to come on in. I told him what I needed and her took my name and number. I was only 12 minutes away, but I am new to Charlotte and I depend on my GPS apps to get me around. I circled Aaron`s this shopping area twice until I accidentally found this places. It is located on the second floor and I had to walk 3 sets of stairs. But when I made it to the top two ladies showed me the elevator. Needless to say Kelly to very good care of my beautiful dip process although they closed at 7p.

Way to long for take out.  Ordered a Large chopped salad with no bell peppers. Guess what? There were bell peppers. Last week I ordered a small chopped salad and it was the same exact size as the Large. Rip off!  Also ordered the Eggplant Parm-Very discouraging to see the eggplant being taken out of the refrigerator and being pre-cooked. I guess this place doesn`t encourage fresh ingredients. Everything is pre-cooked. Including the red gravy. It gets warmed up on a hot plate.  Ordered a 7` and 10`. The 7` needed to be redone because after being cooked it had a huge hole in the middle. The 10` was very soggy and not crispy at all.  No gorgonzola cheese. A main ingredient, how can you be out of that?  There was 1 person in front of me and 1 person behind me. The person in front of me and myself were both not offerred any of the specials. But, the person behind me was and his bill was only $27  for 4 kids and 2 adults with 4 drinks.  I had 1 adult and 2 kids and no drinks-$37.  Went to the Parma awhile back-owned by Chef Marc as well. Ended up leaving after 55 minutes with no food. The eggplant parm at Parma is the exact same size and thing as Novecento but, cost is triple the amount.  The worker that was working the oven seemed extremely overwhelmed. She was doing everything herself.   Too long of a wait for mediocre food. Not worth it.<16<9<2014<18<49<9

A lady called me Friday morning to tell me everything was negative and looked great. I was so thrilled to hear that everything was normal. Then, Friday evening I got a voicemail on my phone RIGHT BEFORE THEY CLOSED FOR THE WEEKEND telling me that there was a mistake and that there is something they needed to talk to me about and that they would talk to me on Monday since they were getting ready to close. She even said on the voicemail '"have a wonderful weekend!'" ALL weekend I was freaking out thinking that I might have something serious. I was a complete mess!   I called back Monday morning to let them know what they did was extremely unprofessional. It turned out my glucose was low.. I was freaking out all weekend for nothing. They could have AT LEAST said on the voicemail that theres nothing to worry about and that we would talk about it on Monday. I understand they couldn`t have told me exactly what was going on over a voicemail because of HIPAA regulations. But there`s nothing wrong with letting me know to not worry about it all weekend OR they shouldn`t have called me 3 minutes before closing.

Like them or not they have a unique taste and style about how they serve fresh and quality ingredients.  The staff in this particular location is super friendly, but not overly so. Like when I show up two days in a row, they don`t even look at you funny. They are very accommodating and their smiles are genuine.  You can get as creative as you want when ordering; your imagination and tummy size are your only limits.  If you ask for '"a little'" they give you a little, if you ask for '"a little more'" they oblige you there too.    The menu is simple. You can order tortilla chips, a burrito (your choice of meat, beans, salsas, opt for lettuce, sour cream, shredded cheese and, for an extra fee, guacamole,) a fajita burrito (which substitutes the beans for grilled sliced peppers and onions) a burrito or fajita burrito `bol` (which are the same ingredients sans tortilla, in an Atkins (low carb)-friendly cardboard dish,) or tacos.   All besides the chips, your food is made fresh as it moves down a line of people putting this in, slapping that on, or wrapping it all up.) If you get there right when they open the chips are so fresh that the bags are still warm. They offer ice tea, fountain drinks and a small selection of bottled beers like Corona and Dos Equis.  The carnitas burrito bowl with grilled veggies, little rice, no beans, extra cilantro, both mild and hot sauce, cheese, sour cream and more cilantro on top is my fav. With chips and guac (and it`s really good guac), it`s a meal that keeps me full all day long.  WHOO HOO!!"<10<12<2010<1<0<46

d32dFs_lVoGz88g5gWYLEQ<o4VWGbthdrg4sQCwB_ul_Q<hGRmkcb0J3EGQkUE7NCsEQ<5<0<0<0<"I`ve lived here for a year and half (I moved in while Phase 1 was still mostly under construction). After reading the one-star reviews, I decided to share my experience and address some of the concerns of my neighbors.  Willows is a good value for your money compared to other new luxury apartments in Charlotte. It`s a smaller community, which I personally prefer over complexes with hundreds and hundreds of units. The office staff have been nothing but friendly and professional in all of my interactions with them. The website for residents provides a lot of useful information and updates. Maintenance is quick to complete requests. They fixed a minor issue with my thermostat setting last winter within 24 hours.   The few things I personally didn`t care for have mostly been resolved since living here. Parking used to be hard to find at night and on weekends, especially during the first summer because residents would host so many visitors that they took up any available spaces. The office remedied this by implementing parking decals and designating spaces for visitors to park. Anyone who doesn`t have a decal displayed in their windshield, has an expired license plate or parks illegally in handicap designated spaces gets towed. So towing isn`t arbitrary and it greatly improved parking for us as residents. I was in the office one day when a girl came in to find out why her car was towed and it was because her plate had expired. Fair enough. My only complaint about parking is that the spaces are really tight and there are too many compact car spaces. I understand this community caters to singles and students, but most of us drive mid- to full-sized vehicles and SUVs.   As for the finishes and structures for the apartments, they`re honestly no different from any new construction. They`re mass produced homes so I`m not sure what`s expected but I haven`t noticed any faults with paint or wood. Even new-build single family homes have minor imperfections.   Noise levels are of course going to be louder on the weekends (sometimes at night but not even every weekend) and holidays. Do people expect their neighbors to not entertain and have visitors at all? Yes, we have a club house but it`s reasonable to expect sometimes for people to host in their home. And it`s not all the time.  There were a few break-ins to vehicles last year but as far as I`m aware, there haven`t been any since. If you live in the University area (especially if you move from another area in Charlotte like I did), it`s on par for the course, hence why your car insurance rate increases. I really don`t think people do their homework and take these things into consideration when they move but I also realize I look into things most people don`t consider so to each his/her own. Also, don`t leave personal items in view in your car anywhere in Charlotte or leave your car unlocked; common sense.  Yes, quite a few students live here. Willows is only a few miles from UNCC and they`re affordable. But there are far fewer students living here than other places much closer to campus. Yes, they make noise on the weekends (it`s not always students, it`s people in general). My only (minor) complaint is that when they`re in the hallways, I don`t think they realize how loud they are and that their voices carry. (Side note: I`ve heard some pretty interesting conversations lol.)  I agree that people DO piggyback through the gate. I don`t have a major issue with it because if someone wants to get in, they can literally park on the side street and walk through/around the gate anyway. '"Gated'" apartment communities foster a false sense of security. It`s different if you live where someone has to buzz you into a building; that`s more secure but anyway I digress. However, I disagree that the gate has been broken multiple times; people exaggerate. It was broken once. Literally. And it was quickly repaired.  Club house events were probably reduced because people weren`t attending them. I`m only guessing because I wasn`t able to go to any due to my schedule. If people will attend or request them to be reinstated, I`m sure management will bring them back. Why not suggest events or talk to management to see why they were discontinued? You live here and it`s your neighborhood. If you want to see something changed, provide constructive feedback.  The first few months, packages that were left at residents` doors were occasionally stolen but not really anymore. We now have Amazon lockers which is fantastic and has helped a lot.  Finally, if you see trash outside, notify maintenance. Don`t wait for someone else to notice or report it. Same with spiderwebs. I don`t get what`s so hard about that but whatever. A lot of these so-called complaints can be resolved by being proactive. Some of it too is how people approach it. I hope I`ve helped give a more honest, objective review. You can`t please everyone but I hope I`ve been fair and at least dispelled some of the complaints."<18<10<2019<15<40<13

Mary Beth greeted us and was so nice and knowledgeable. She has TONS of dresses, I did not feel like I was trying on plus-size anything. She is amazing with what she can clip and tuck and knows everything about those dresses and how they arrive. Great experience!<20<10<2019<2<53<11
hxKhIqM77MjRpZEBBgQXpw<YC5-JiPq0J8y9QpJKxvRrw<heEOiJnBxYN76JCAcdG05g<1<4<1<0<"Hmmmm, okay.   I visited this establishment on a late Thursday night after work, about 10pm. The lady at the counter immediately brought up giving tip, '"good massage means good tip.'" Okay... She led me to a room towards the exit. The masseuse wasn`t even in the building- she had to call him a couple times to come in and... massage me. He arrived ten mins later. He opened the door and immediately started massaging my shoulders, which I thought was weird because I didn`t hear him wash his hands nor did he introduce himself to me. He, and by literally I mean literally, just lightly tapped and squeezed my body parts for about twenty minutes. The tap was as powerful as someone asking you politely to get out of their way. *tap tap* I thought about getting up and walking out but I was too tired from working 13+ hours all week and thought he might just be '"warming up.'" I turned around and he gave me a face massage which I thought was a nice touch, until I smelled his fingers and they smelled like food. Cherry on top was when he barely touched my calves and, really, lower half. Most of the massage was on my shoulders and upper back. As I was getting dressed, the lady from the front opened the door and asked for my card for tip. '"May I get dressed first?'" '"Tip.'" '"...okay I will meet you outside after I put on my pants.'" '"Tip.'" I slowly closed the door on her and she waited outside the door til I was done then immediately reached out for my card and asked for tip. Sis........  Maybe they were having an off day, I don`t know. But Id really truly honestly rather never ever go back to this establishment for the rest of my life.   I walked out more stressed than when I walked in."<27<5<2019<5<31<19

I got there at 8:05 a.m. And the ticket printer wasn`t working. A gentleman came around the corner immediately and opened the box and gave me my ticket.   I get in line behind 4 other cars and the same gentleman who helped me with my ticket comes and takes me out of line and puts me in an empty bay.   While I`m waiting for my emissions and sitting in the chair, I had my hand over my eye because the Sun was shining directly in my face. Another guy comes out of the office and closes the bay door halfway so the sun wasn`t in my face anymore.   The gentleman who did my emissions, handed me my paperwork and said my car was in beautiful shape and I didn`t need to come back for 2 years.  Just really genuine guys.

Our server was Alyssa and she was gem and extremely attentive and a sweetheart. If you dine there, ask for her because you WILL have the best service!   The artichoke dip was out of this world and so was the cheesy garlic bread. The strawberry Gorgonzola salad was delicious. We ordered the chicken pesto pizza and the Super 6 pizza.

Although my husband did regret getting the super large size prime rib (he orders it medium rare, and it came out pretty cold).  I had the sea bass, and it was quite good.  Next time, I will ask to have the sauce on the side though.  It had a nice flavor, but masked the taste of the fish.  Our server....was awful.  We ordered appetizers that never arrived, because he forgot to put them in.  He was not attentive to refills, nor did he come back to check on how our food was, etc.  Also, when we ordered dessert, my sister got hers first, and had to start eating it (because it had ice cream).  She was completely done and my husband and I hadn`t received ours yet.  The busser was quite attentive, definitely filling in where the server was lacking, and was given a separate cash tip handed to him, as we very much appreciated his service.  Our server only got 10% - sorry, but if you provide bad service, your tip will go down accordingly.  Then he had the nerve to complain to the manager about his low tip, within our earshot.  We went over and informed the manager of exactly WHY his tip was so low.  Again, despite the poor server, we will be back.  We just hope José isn`t our server again, and if he is, we will request a different one.<21<3<2013<20<33<19

You will see wildlife such as reptiles, rabbits, birds, and who knows maybe a coyote. The main cements trails is approx 2 miles long however there are plenty of stone and dirt trails that wander off. My only complaint is that some trails lead to a dead end so be careful going out without some idea of where you are heading if those temperatures are hot.  Also they offer a great discovery center that teaches you through many interactive exhibits about the land ... Oh and it`s all totally free!  This place is a nice place and I hope that people keep it that way. It a great place that makes me somewhat forget that I live in this gross desert.

The caramelized banana and raspberry sauce went together really well. The pancakes aren`t too sweet and taste a bit eggy. My friend got the Fuwa Fuwa Signature which she liked a lot. The pancakes were a bit lighter than I expected, so if you have a bigger appetite I suggest getting a smaller dessert or a drink to go with it (their matcha latté is great).  There was barely any wait for the food even though the place was packed, and the staff were all very friendly! The only reason I knocked off a star is because of the interior, there`s only a couple of tables and some high chairs in the back. When my friend and I were sitting in the high chairs, the people in line were standing right behind us which felt a bit stuffy -- I suggest going at a time that`s less busy to try and get a table.<10<2<2019<7<36<3

Mixed feelings about it so far.  The tips of my teeth are definitely whiter, but the middle and parts closer to the gum line saw a minimal change.  I bought two 50 minute sessions, so we`ll see how the next one goes.    I`m not saying don`t check this place out, but understand there are things that can make your visit more pleasant.  If the owner is reading this, it would be helpful to put your own music at a low volume or even put on some headphones.

The monorail was recommended by their own employees. It cost $12 for a day pass, but the stops are few in a circle. Destinations were still a mile walk from the monorail.   Uber was the popular thing. It`s too expensive $7 to $15 on a two-mile radius. Blame traffic... It would have been nice to rent a bike or scooter, but the city would have to make a lane for the ease of that new traffic flow.  I won money at the casinos on Wednesday. I probably should have gone shopping, but to lug everything all home... I wasn`t the least bit upset. It made me have a great time loitering around in like 5 casinos. So I gave it back having fun.   Bugs are everywhere. Maybe, it`s the desert. Still, pest control has to be an imperative here.   Friendly environment. I wouldn`t call Las Vegas a Hell. However, I was saddened by the drug users (heroine and marijuana) and homeless on the streets. As a visitor for a drugless America... How to keep people of this city clean?<12<9<2019<15<32<44

Not that I`ve had a ton of them, but this is the best.   It`s not cheap, but the food definitely tasted high quality to me. When I go to a buffet I like to try a little bit of everything, but I don`t like to waste food. We typically go to buffets at the end of breakfast so they are starting to put lunch out and we can get the best of both.   What I like about Vegas is they know they`re a tourist town so they know they have to please people from everywhere. They can`t just serve American food and do that right. They have to be able to please palates from around the world. That`s not easy. What I found most frustrating for most of my stay in Vegas was the lack of accommodation for customers, but at this place they at least try to have some options available (sugar free desserts? OMG!)  Start with breakfast. Are these powdered eggs? They didn`t taste like it to me. And the potatoes were definitely fresh. The bacon was crispy and not greasy. They also had eggs Benedict, delicious grits (OK, not Alabama or Georgia delicious, but good,) prime rib, omelets, pies and cakes of all sorts, seafood, biscuits and gravy, pancakes, french toast, you name it. I`m hungry again already.<28<2<2019<3<11<25

As walking by the counter where the '"buffet'" was served the counter help proceeded to throw the buffet out!!! Oh my God.  All that food.  Something should be done, why aren`t they just selling the slices after the buffet? Sell it at half price. Give it away, make less, give it to the employees anything but throwing it away.  If you have to throw it out, do it when the customers aren`t walking by. Or let`s get rid of the buffet.  We Americans need to do something."<23<1<2019<21<52<25

The first time was a farm call and the second time was for surgery due to life threatening colic/impaction. The second instance required a week long stay for my mare at the CVMC  '"horsepital'".  The facility is amazing and state of the art. The investment in tech and infrastructure is top of the line.  All of the vets here are extremely knowledgeable and amazingly competent. Dr. Liepman was especially helpful and genuinely caring.  I have had a bunch of horses and personally have known four or five great large animal vets.  A couple have even been close friends. None of them are anywhere near the level that Dr Liepman is.  She is Tier 1 vet care for sure! This area of Cave Creek has a ton of large animal vets, so if you are reading this review looking for advice on who to choose.....look no further.  Choose CVMC and specifically ask for Dr. Liepman.  Your horse will thank you."<12<1<2019<0<10<19

I was really surprised at how quickly the manager Kim got in touch with me after I posted this review. She was so kind and empathetic towards me about my experience and invited me to come back and try out the services with another staff member. I could tell that she really cares about her clients and really believes in their business as well. As I said previously, this clinic was so beautiful and the other staff was gorgeous, so I was inclined to give it another shot. I was also advised that the woman I wrote the review about (whom I think all the less than 5 star reviews were about) no longer works there. Relief! On my next visit I went in for Dysport. I met Kim, the manager and she was so lovely and kind, the rest of the staff was just as lovely as the last time. The nurse I saw was ridiculously amazing. I`ve been to soooo many medspas and I`ve had so many treatments done but this nurse (I wishhhhh I could remember her name) is already my favorite injector. Talking to her was relaxing and the conversation was hilarious. She was so knowledgeable and didn`t make me feel rushed, she took her time explaining everything to me. I went after work and this was easily the best part of my day. She was so gentle too. I don`t know what her technique is to minimize pain but it`s incredible! I scheduled another appointment to go back and try micro-needling again. I`m so glad Kim called me and I`m so glad I gave this place another shot. This will definitely be my go-to medspa.  I highly recommend everyone to give Drops of Beauty a try.<28<9<2019<0<16<21

So far I`ve spent $300 in app and admin fees only to later find out via emailed documents that what was promised to me I am not getting after the fact they have taken my money. I am still waiting for a call back from the '"manager'" who doesn`t seem to have a presence at this property. Amanda Todd is the individual I have been told was out of office the first and second time  and in my final attempt in which I had to make the phone call a third time , she was in a meeting , and still no resolution in sight.

Our application and admin fee that we paid for has December 7 as move in date and at no point was this brought to our attention until 48- 72 hours post  application filing . Now I find out , via email docs there`s a $500 security deposit and a $50 fitness gym fee (located in the main lobby so there is no privacy) .

It was a nice experience overall.   Everything is mostly purple yam flavored, so you`ll either love it or not. Some other highlighted flavors may be matcha (for tiramisu) options and milk (ice cream)  We ordered the purple yam tiramisu and ice cream. The tiramisu was an interesting soft and squishy texture. Definitely make sure to have each bite be an equal portion of the top and bottom; the cake base on the bottom and the purple yam dusting on the top taste best together.   The purple yam ice cream was a bit strong in the yam taste.  Both desserts were not too sweet which we appreciated. Presentation was incredibly cute; super insta-worthy.   Only downside is that the service can be a little slow. They have limited staff and the desserts seem to be quality/detail-intensive so it may take a while for you to receive your dessert.<14<10<2019<20<33<48

Jb1Uuv4cG9ZyFbHaeeLbQA<fevZHE2TzxaAcM5JnQN7rA<wIxYAU2jaT6Y9b_Inc5MXA<1<2<2<0<"I had been a customer of Modern Dentistry for several years. I found myself cancelling appointments for no good reason, because I felt so uncomfortable about going there. In my opinion, they treat their customers like cattle, and are cult-like in their expectation of ubiquitous compliance to their methods.   On my last visit, which will be my last one FOREVER, I tried to clear up an irregularity before my appointment that had been going on with my dental insurance and their office for five months. The front desk met me that dead-eyed, tag team, officious condescension that was one of the reasons I had cancelled previous appointments. They repeatedly refused to look at my new dental insurance card, (my insurance coverage changed in January).  When Dr. Tan arrived to '"perform'" my annual check, instead of being concerned about why their last insurance claim from March, hadn`t been approved yet in August;  rather, he was only concerned how I conducted myself within the cult... er I mean, his office! He told me I needed to treat his employees better in the future!?!?  Okay, that DID get my back up, and I walked out at that point, I forgot to check to see if he was holding a cattle prod in his hand at that time before I left... My bad.  Even in the military, the dentists who outranked me, never told me how I needed to act. I am certainly not going to accept edicts from a dentist, who told me directly that not that long ago, he had worked for In-N-Out Burger. As an American, I am stunned that another American thinks he has the authority to tell another what to say/do. As a customer, am flabbergasted at the lack of understanding of where the revenue comes from to keep his business operating.  In trying to become a better person for Dr. Tan, I will look for this in my new replacement dental office:  1) When the office demands that I sign copious electronic signatures, I will in turn demand to see what I am signing, and no longer just take their word for what I am signing. (You have a legal right, and a fiduciary responsibility to see what you are signing. Demand they turn that damn screen around).  2) I don`t need to '"get to know'" my dentist in his office prior to being a customer. I did not know my doctor, my airline pilot, or my realtor before conducting business with them. It appears to confuse some people into believing that the relation is more than a business relation, and has slipped into some kind of father/son-type deal...  3) If they need to have a separate person '"brief'" you on your cost options, their cost options are probably too high. It feels a lot like a car dealership when they do that-- who LIKES to go to a car dealership?  4) No matter how many unnecessary pictures and x-rays are taken of your mouth, the dentist still needs to look around inside that mouth on a real check-up. That`s the best way to discover mouth cancers."<25<8<2019<22<13<3

I ordered my steak well done, as a I always do. I asked if the kitchen would have a problem making it and was assured absolutely not. My steak came out, medium. Lots and lots of pink and lots of blood. That is NOT how I eat my steak. UGH. So I have to send that back. I also have to ask where my shrimp are. I`d like to eat those now while I wait for my steak. Apparently they forgot them, so they came out a few minutes later. One was warm, but cooked. The other was cool and waaaaaay under. OMG, are you serious? Now I have NO steak and no shrimp? The mashed potatoes were not yukon and were runny. Not deliciously creamy as you`d expect. The spinach was good. The asparagus were OK. The manager comp`d us dessert for the steak incident, and they did bring out 3 pipin hot fresh made shrimp after I returned the first one. The creme brulee donuts were SOOOOOO GOOD!

The summit bowl (soft serve) is a strong go to, if you like cashews. The only negative things I can say about the place is that the parking lot is super hard to get into, especially if your car is low.

OdsF2CuOfH7N9_f_ekPUow<lJsV5pxonVoCFvCkc0XhJQ<M30Ndb5zaFyU0m-qVLngiw<1<8<0<0<I will no longer recommend Bathurst Dupont Animal Hospital to anybody. There`s a multitude of reasons:  1. The vets here have no idea what they`re doing. Maybe they`re busy, disorganized, just dumb, or all of the above. I`ve been taking my senior cat here for the last two years. She got really sick with intestinal issues a year ago. During this time, they did multiple blood tests and X-rays but was never able to formally explain what was wrong. Not to mention I kept getting passed from vet to vet so every time a different vet saw me, they would be confused or start over. No form of diagnosis. No treatment plan. No answers. They seemed as confused as I was.  2. They do so many useless tests here and their communication skills for non-existent. Even though their prices are lower than almost in the city, you get what you pay for. We did so many blood tests that gave us no information about my cat`s illness (yet they kept recommending it). Turns out, I found out that the type of blood test they were doing was the wrong kind for intestinal issues. We kept taking X-rays. Turns out X-rays don`t really show what you need to know for that either (should`ve suggested an ultrasound or biopsy instead). They prescribed me a medicine that vet #1 told me she could take indefinitely. Another vet there got mad at us for asking for more of it since cats aren`t supposed to take it long term. WHAT?! Get your story straight. The vets here also don`t give you options either. They just decide what`s best and move forward without giving you an idea of what else could happen.  3. They do dental cleanings without anesthesia. They did this to my cat without my consent. I was given a quote for a dental cleaning with anesthesia for my cat (and we also did blood work to ensure that she was able to get the anesthesia since she is older). After the dental cleaning, I found out that they did NOT use anesthesia. They just wrapped her up in a blanket and did the cleaning with her awake. I was horrified. Because dental cleanings without anesthesia are purely aesthetic since you cannot clean under the gums, and it`s also a terrifying experience for the animal since they`re being held down for a long period of time and have no idea what`s going on. 4. The staff that work here are so bitter, sour, and rude. I`ve mentioned this before. There`s not always someone at the reception. So when you come in, sometimes nobody comes to greet you. I remember knocking on the door a couple times (since I had been waiting for a while with no acknowledgement) and being yelled at / having the door slammed in my face.   Overall, after being a client here for over two years - I`m leaving with a very bad taste in my mouth. Coming here is rarely a positive experience anymore. I don`t even really care about the poor customer service as long as they`re taking care of my fur baby - except they didn`t - the worst part was realizing that my cat was suffering for so long while they were doing unnecessary tests but telling me she was `fine` (she wasn`t). I don`t even want to think about all the money but most importantly TIME I wasted here. Do yourself a favour and go elsewhere.   PS I was so frustrated that I finally switched a different clinic. In one appointment, my new vet was able to diagnose my senior cat`s illness and we`ve already proceeded with a treatment plan.<20<4<2019<18<25<35

I wondered in here on my way to Bulk Barn. It`s a small shop and it is not that great in the '"looks'" department, but they have all the basic goods at GREAT PRICES and really, that`s all I care about.  Also, there are no labels for your items. One women inside seemed to be really disturbed by that and she kept going on about that in the store.

BUT it is nothing that will leave a lasting impact. They do traditional breakfast well... but it is not worth hours of waiting in my opinion. It is nice that they give your coffee while waiting, and the service is amazing. The decor is cute and the quality of food is great as well. Just NOT worth the wait. I would go to Breakfast club over here in a heartbeat.<10<3<2019<0<26<2

He is an amazing person from a family owned business that is here to service the customer period! He caught some issues from when the opener was installed originally and fixed them with no extra charge while installing my brand new WIFI QUIET garage door opener. Matt was referred to me by another very satisfied customer of his down the street. Matt has now impressed three people on my street. I very much admire people who are here to solve problems and not rip you off! If you have an issue with anything garage door related.... Call Matt... you will not be sorry. When my neighbors door was damaged on a holiday, others wanted $150 just to show up before any work was started.... no emergency fee with Matt!<23<9<2019<21<58<48

Most of my in class  I spent were watching same boring videos when even some of them had nothing to do with driving. My teachers  super relax  making nonsense jokes wasting  time on extra long breaks. More jokes came on my first driving lesson where my instructor came 10 min late and made me finish my two hours lesson 5 minutes earlier. When I first get in the car, it was dirty and smelly. My instructor barefoot not wearing his seat belt all the time, and very often he  was texting and checking his phone while I was driving. Very disgusting experience.<10<1<2019<9<25<38

As if I should have known the manager`s schedule.   I asked again.  (Because no legitimate business operates that way).  I explained that I am from out of state and I won`t be back for months.

3SVihbPjct5SLnfFgdw-Tw<dTl3ZFTXfAEAdYyu41GCCQ<Gpko17Mzd6qUOOp7whNskw<1<1<0<0<Wow.  That about sums it up, and not a good wow.  The theatre reminds me of an old school elementary school cafeteria that has a stage in the back.  Super small stage.  My living room is larger.  The entire production takes me back to high school.   Choreography was lacking and so was any type of enthusiasm from the cast.  Do you get to see tatas? Yes, but only after this annoying middle aged woman screams `titties` at you about 25 times.  Seriously, she must be an original.  Speaking of the MC, I`ve seen 12 year olds get a crowd more excited than she can.  It`s basically `make some noise if you want to see boobies` and that`s the extent of it.  The intermission was beyond horrible with the same unenthusiastic lady trying to be funny and ask about some couples sex life.  What is this, Dr fucking Drew?  Speaking of fuck, if you like hearing it said repeatedly during on the soundtrack of one of the acts then you`re in luck!    For a production that`s lasted 32 years I have to seriously question why.  Poor seating, as in it`s all floor level seating.  So if you`re three rows back in your comfy banquet chair, yes, those shitty chairs you find at hotel banquet halls, you can`t see a damn thing.  Even vip seating if you`re back row you`re screwed.  I saw more ass off the gogo dancers in the bj party pit than I could in this show. I can probably count on one hand how many people work it.  A stage hand, one guy for lighting and sound, a wardrobe tech, and 2 ushers who found it necessary to shine their 40k lumens lights every 5 minutes.  This show doesn`t hold a candle flame to Fantasy.  I`ve seen a lot of burlesque shows and this one is easily the bottom feeder.  I won`t judge the casts appearance, but let`s just say I get the feeling these are the rejects from other productions.  It`s amateur hour folks.  Don`t pay full price.  If you must see this disgrace to the art, get your tix from a discount seller.<29<11<2019<8<54<37

Ordered 2 drinks (one non-alcoholic), on a tab.  Took the credit card and an ID, of course. Closed the tab right after the 2 drinks. Bill was charged as about $24.   Next day card was charged a perfect $90. Called our bank and they see that the bill was initially $20 something dollars.   We were both pretty sober and coherent. There was no way we tipped that much by accident.    Now to the dancers...   Got quoted $300 for a private 30 minute dance. Dancer tried to sell it by adding that cocaine was complimentary with that price. Dancer asked me to come to the washroom with her, before I`ve agreed to a dance, so that she can give a bump. Sale tactic way of getting me to feel like I owe and and am obliged to her.   We opted out of the dance because $300 was too much for 30 minutes.

Our showerhead wasn`t even connected to the wall, our bathtub FILLED WITH DIRTY TOILET WATER ON OUR FIRST WEEK & they said '"it happens'", i found maggoty looking bugs in our living roour kitchen drawers fall out (the maintenance guy literally only put putty to secure it), the floor is wet like rubber always since its NOT wood floors like they say, the door deadlock literally fell out of the wall leaving our door easy to break into even with the fact that our door gets STUCK & we have to pop it open already, our AC is broken and till this day they REFUSE to give us another ac unit because ours is '"the newest model'" even though it doesn`t work & they WONT let us turn it lower than 60 even though WE are paying for it!! Next, our bathroom air vent was closed and broken since day one then they came to '"fix'" it and now the vent is BARELY HANGING from the ceiling , because he didn`t screw it all the way and LEFT his mess!!! Plus, they`ve had exterminators come for roaches 4 times now and our pool was green and slimey for two weeks and they barely now just shocked it! This place is a mess, dont bother coming to live here, its a mistake we made & are trying to get out of.   UPDATE: 08.26.19 we`ve realized the little white bugs coming from under our walls have been baby roaches & we found some NEW dead roaches as well and we`ve been told by all our neighbors they`ve been having roach problems and had exterminators come over 4 times now this year only!! Our neighbors upstairs have it so bad they cant even risk having furniture or food in the apartment!!  & our ceiling in the bathroom started to convex in and we reported it already a week now & they said they`ll look into it and haven`t done anything & now its starting to crack!! so dangerous and ridiculous.  UPDATE AGAIN: the comment that they posted is so untrue and you can ask my '"roommate'" who is my fiancé who`s literally called them multiple times and even come to the office about the problems, we have screenshots of phone records n all. I don`t like that im being harassed for a review & when my fiancé handles all my calls & calls them after they call me & THEY EVEN SAY IN THE VOICEMAILS THAT THEY CALL HIM ASWELL, so its not just me handling the situation its a two person thing."<26<8<2019<5<59<13

My nails also chipped within 3 hours of them being done. I know nails can chip when it is regular polish but the painful over trimming of my nails is not a normal event. I went on vacation with painful fingers and chipped polish. When I returned from my holiday I called them to discuss my experience. They then proceeded to explain to me how to use lotion and that the weather was to blame. I am so tired of these nail salons treating people like garbage. It is expensive to get your nails done and everyone treats you like it is pennies and you are stupid.   I`ll never return and they don`t care about that but save yourself the stress. Unless you know the person who is doing your nails this is not a good place to drop in. You may get someone who has no idea what they are doing but they`ll still charge you full price and expect a tip.   Here is my tip to you all, find a different place!!!!<4<12<2019<18<43<3

Due to the Review Guidelines of Yelp, I will not be disclosing the names of the employees who work at Lyons Auto Body. They will be referred to as: EMPLOYEES, he, she, and they.   My car was towed to Lyons Auto Body shop and I went in to sign a release form for my car to be moved to CarStar, which my insurance company works with and recommended. When I went into Lyons Auto Body, I met `EMPLOYEE B` and he convinced me to sign a form consenting for them to take a look at my car. I contacted my insurance company right away when I left Lyons Auto Body, and they recommended that I have my car released instead of Lyons Auto Body looking at it. I immediately called Lyons Auto Body back and spoke with `EMPLOYEE B` and I told him to disregard that form I signed. He replied '"okay'". I also told him to NOT have anyone touch my car and `EMPLOYEE B` said '"okay'". I called back shortly and notified the lady at the front desk that I will be bringing in my release form tomorrow, and she agreed it was fine. I brought the release form to them the very next day and left. 9 days later, my car was still sitting at Lyons. I decided to call CarStar, as that is who was supposed to pick up my car. The representative from CarStar told me they were waiting on Lyons to pick up their phone, as CarStar keeps calling and no one ever answers. I called Lyons Auto Body and I asked to speak to someone regarding my release form, which I was told was `EMPLOYEE J` (owner). I was transferred to his extension but had to leave a voice message. I called Lyons back and asked if `EMPLOYEE J` was physically in the office and the lady at the front desk said yes. I told her I will be coming in to see him right now. She said okay. When I got there, I told the lady I was there to see `EMPLOYEE J`. She went to the back to get him and `EMPLOYEE B` came out instead. He began telling me someone is coming to look at my car on Friday and that my insurance company is to blame. I immediately called my insurance company and they told me that the lady who deals directly with Lyons said they cannot do anything because Lyons has a work order form from me. As aforementioned: I CALLED LYONS AND NOTIFIED `EMPLOYEE B` TO DISREGARD THAT FORM, AND HE AGREED. I got upset and asked `EMPLOYEE B` why he did not disregard that form?! He kept going back and forth with no answer, to '"It was a part of the process for the people to come look at it'". Like I said, I ordered for no one to touch my car and he AGREED. The lady who I had on the phone from my insurance company told me that they should have NOT touched my car as I TOLD them NOT to. `EMPLOYEE B` removed the hood of my car. `EMPLOYEE B` became extremely rude and unprofessional, as he was LITERALLY yelling at me, telling me it`s my insurance company to blame. He also yelled at me telling me my car was a write off. I got so upset that I began to cry. `EMPLOYEE B` used these words and said '"you`re a psychopath'". I told him he cannot talk to me that way and that was not good customer service. How does a worker call their customer a psychopath? I was in tears. There was clearly something wrong with what they did. The lady at the front desk came over to me and tried to touch me to guide me outside and talk. I told her do not touch me. I asked her to speak to someone higher than `EMPLOYEE B` and she said she is higher. I asked her how she is allowing him to speak to me that way. She said she told him to stop. Him stopping doesn`t disregard what he did and said to me. `EMPLOYEE B` then picked up my glasses and car keys and brought them to me and told me I need to leave. I told him to NOT touch my stuff. I then asked `EMPLOYEE B` and the lady at the front desk to give me the work form back or get rid of it. They gave me a COPY of it. I told them to disregard the original. I am not even sure if they listened. I was on the phone with my insurance company that entire time I was present at Lyons Auto Body. The lady I was speaking to let me know the entire call was recorded. The lady from my insurance company then called Lyons Auto Body and told them to NOT touch my car or the matter will be taken to court. I am grateful for that much, from my insurance company.   A few days later, a gentleman who works with my insurance company went to take a look at my car to give me an appraisal of how much it would cost to fix. For my safety, I asked the gentleman with my insurance company to be with me with `EMPLOYEE J`. We met up with the owner of Lyons Auto Body: `EMPLOYEE J`. Before going inside, `EMPLOYEE J` spoke to me in private asking if we could talk alone and I firmly told him NO, the guy from my insurance company WILL be in the room with us. When all 3 of us went into the room, `EMPLOYEE J` told me he read my review on Yelp and told me that if I removed it, he will release my car."<19<5<2019<14<38<37

I messaged Che exactly five days after receiving the corset.

They have a good selection of beer and wine and I found their prices to be affordable for a pretty nice restaurant. I think it would be a perfect date night spot or even just a place for a casual weekday dinner or drinks.<17<5<2018<22<46<53
c3_2sxIYDgPjmC3Amlzp8w<pwQ8E-hbDUJe3qtKt_IBBg<bjhaEF0JeDGwOg6Ko3opwg<1<5<1<3<"Just to be clear- here are my reasons for a one star review: customer service is always key especially when the establishment caters to kids, price is more than average, cleanliness is questioned, and last but not least, customer service again!!   Original: This place is a kids mad house!! First off, I bought a groupon and the fine print all the way close to the bottom of the 20 sentences of fine print states that is not valid on weekends. Ok, they should of made this more clear. We don`t even live in the area and the cashier states right away '"not valid on weekends so we will price match you'". It`s obvious that they have been getting lots of people trying to redeem their voucher on the weekends. She tried to charge us over $40 and it was one kid and two adults which was incorrect. The supervisor came by and fixed it but he was not friendly either as I asked if we can just use the credit and pay the difference since we don`t live in the area. He goes '"you can just get a refund from Groupon'". Awesome customer service, buddy - not.  The playground is crazy! Tight spaces for adults to climb up and even though kids have to wear socks, I see tons of adults wearing their shoes. How annoying - the place should be completely shoeless for a cleanliness. The toddler zone is small. You pay extra for games and their bungee jump, but the price for just admission was kinda high. We paid $20 for two adults and one child.   I will come back on the weekday to redeem this Groupon I have, but that`s it. I thought prior to coming that if my daughter liked this place, we would have her birthday party here but I don`t like this place because of my initial experience with the cashier and supervisor so we will not have her birthday party celebrated here. They just lost a customer - and not a $20 customer, a $400-500 customer."<19<10<2019<4<3<31

QD9ryvSUi8n0a-bf3H3wJQ<z6kJyjcLaypT-y9wQRQ00g<kDCyqlYcstqnoqnfBRS5Og<5<1<0<0<I had a long layover and wanted to find a cute coffeeshop. This place was amazing. Small and quaint with art on the walls. Many people were there on laptops working. There was one outside table and the rest were inside. I ordered the Chai Latte and Avocado toast. Both were delicious! I actually liked that the avocado hash was on the side so that I can spread the avocado however I wanted in the 3 slices of toast. I`ll definitely be back.<28<11<2019<16<18<22

Well I love beer flights and I love coffee, so boom, a coffee flight?  I`m in.  Came here on a late Saturday morning and only ordered the coffee flight... $10.  See picture to see what it offered.  I only enjoyed the latte.  I struggled on the rest of the coffee.  I guess their beans aren`t my cup of tea...ahem, coffee.  I would like to try out their breakfast and see how that goes, the place seemed pretty busy but not crazy packed.  They also had a pretty interesting band playing.  Very interesting.<20<8<2019<21<30<20
WeJtvVRK5itACjswqivGLA<82yn-MFahIQ4zRcKW-eHLA<hPRNV9hE5Ac9vXGKHePG1Q<2<2<0<0<My expectations were not too high going in and overall it was about what I expected. Service was mediocre at best as I had to wait about five minutes just to be acknowleged by someone to get a table.  When I was seated, it was at a dirty table which had to be cleaned. Chair I sat in was sticky, eww. The restaurant was busy (100pm on Saturday), but it still was a bit dirtier and more unorganized than most. Waitress was pleasent enough but did not offer or refill my drink until right when I was about to leave. Actually, the best part was the meal itself. I had grilled chicken over rice with asparagus. The grilled chicken was moist and flavorful, while the aspargus was cooked just right and delicious. The price was also ok. The meal was definitely close to a 3.5/4 while most everything else was a 2 or a 1. Overall, a 2.5 and would try again, just not anytime soon.<17<2<2018<18<53<41
Mi7mWdL6GYfmy119B0AA0w<cs-oO8pUzoxsJKfI5rRrSA<XvWw0DlG5qkSDZpsficDgA<5<2<0<0<We randomly found this place on our last trip to Vegas.  And it is such a gem of a spot!  We ended up going there three nights in a row and spending our anniversary night there playing darts.  It has an mazing local vibe, interesting locals and honestly the coolest bartenders in town.  Bob and Kerry took such amazing care of us that we felt right at home instantly and as if we were at our local bar in LA. They had us laughing and smiling so much... can`t say enough good things about these two beautiful souls.  We are truly coming back to Vegas just to hang out at CDs!

A07nKt6BkPiQPofunjgvCw<NO7hzgi7ZS3b2D5gNi2Gfg<lgiGMlWoS82ZRMvQ2hPkdg<4<2<0<1<So initially I was definitely a little frustrated with the flow - from where we parked it wasn`t intuitive to find the theater or the box office. I waited in a long line at the Box Office, with only one staff member working, so we couldn`t just easily pick up our tickets from will call. This, in turn, made us late getting into the show, missing the first several minutes.  However, after getting seated (which the ushers were extremely helpful and kind!), all my frustrations quickly vanished because these two gents were absolutely hilarious! I was nervous my 6 yr-old wouldn`t understand what was happening, but no, she was guffawing as loud as any of us! Great humor, slapstick, and storytelling, as well as ad libbing! They played well off each other and had a terrific dynamic that translated to their performance. It felt so authentic and genuine, and the three of us enjoyed the show. Seating and venue is small, which is great because there were no bad seats - everyone felt close to the stage.<11<12<2019<21<29<56

He is aka the Cake Boss and I guess this is his restaurant. Buddys pride themselves on authentic Italian food such as their pizzas, cheeses, and other goodies.   I came here for an event and I was able to try the Pizza , meatball, sliced ham, and cheese platter. The pizzas weren`t anything special and didn`t taste much different compared to other pizza places. They were good though. The meats and cheese were just okay as well, I didn`t taste much of a difference between store bought and the meat and cheese here.   Service here is pretty bad, we had a waitress that originally took our order and then disappeared throughout the night. She would nod and said that she was coming but never came back to us. Inside is also really loud and not a good spot if you`re trying to make conversation with someone. Overall, it was nice to try something from Buddy`s restaurant but I feel like it`s more of a gimmick than an actual Italian restaurant.<3<11<2019<9<23<48
8FMdavzoz5_QQDGtuIjGLA<KVjABt5duc5h-_GH5qxHQg<hq40BO3AH15ZTb3U5nwm6A<4<0<0<0<Greetings!  This review will include 3 positives, 3 negatives and 6 suggestions for improvement.   Positives:  1)  I was deeply grateful for an early move-in date which allowed me ample time to clear and clean out my previous digs.  2)  I love the southeast facing location and accompanying sunshine!  3)  Two robin families used the tree outside my bdrm window to hatch their broods of 2 then 3 baby robins and it was like having my very own nature documentary! Negatives:  1)  The most noticeable and saddening thing for me has been the lack of cleanliness & upkeep generally speaking in the building.  I was unable to use the laundry machines without feeling like I needed to throw up - they were filthy (both washers & dryers, the door, walls, floor).  I actually cleaned it all myself then followed up with insistence that more be done.  2)  I could not get living room blinds installed until the start of the 6th month of my 6-mo lease.  The blinds that were installed are of the cheapest quality imaginable.  3)  I am on the 3rd floor of this 3-storey walkup and the exhaust fans for all the suites are on the roof which means there is an annoying noise level at all times AND the air circulation is terrible in the rest of the apt - all the air is sucked out of the bathroom ceiling fan vent.  I literally have 3 oscillating table fans now (1 ea for the bdrm, living rm, dining rm). Suggestions for Improvement:  1-Invest in new carpeting & paint for the bldg. hallways so it feels like home, a safe & welcoming space.  2-Reduce the number of lamps in the hallways or use dimmer bulbs (they`re uncomfortably bright as is). 3-Invest in new washers/dryers that use Coinamatic cards. 4-Invest in a cleaning lady for a regular, daily cleaning routine (of both entrance doors, mail area, stairwell walls, stairs, railings, windows, and the laundry room floors/ceiling,sink/cabinet).  5-Beautify the landscape by adding scented lilac bushes and other shrubbery all around the front and entrance of the bldg. including the east side of the bldg.  6-Decorate the walls inside the laundry rm so it is a welcoming space.  CHEERS!<13<12<2019<9<22<2

eqkGR4hdrpSkJPnFzfv8Hw<HdOMMT-x4R_HRpSgjRnoug<SBDq5PMLK0-gPVl-lsLQYw<5<5<4<5<"It seems like it took an ETERNITY to build and open this little 400 sq. ft. coffee stand. It finally opened on Monday, and I stopped by on Thursday.  It sits in the parking lot of Castle Sports Club, conveniently, on my way to work. They have a pretty extensive menu, including the usual coffee and espresso items, along with some more unusual items, like energy drinks.  This location is (wo)manned by a couple of cute, smiling girls with trendy hair. One took my order, and the other made my americano. It was a pretty good price for a double - $1.75 or so. They were a little heavy-handed with the half and half, but that`s forgivable.  While I was waiting for my beverage, I noticed they have several different specials throughout the week, including discounts on Tuesdays if you have their antenna topper on your car, and double punches on your punch card on Wednesdays.  My americano was pretty tasty, from what I could tell, underneath the cream. What I found really exciting was the cup. I know. I`m a dork.   But the lid was so cool! It has a little sliding door you sip out of, controlled by a built-in lever. Great one-handed control for driving, and it keeps the coffee from bubbling out when you`re bouncing around on old leaf springs.   This place could so be a dangerous habit for me. Yeah, the Human Bean is a franchise. But it`s not Starbucks.  EDIT 11/16/07: I had to come back and give them another star. I`ve been stopping by now on average twice a week. Now the girls know what I order.  This morning, the had it waiting for me when I got to the window. How awesome is that? Not only that, but because there was a '"wait,'" and by '"wait'" I mean I was the 3rd person in line, they gave me an extra punch of my loyalty card. I`m only one away from a freebie, baby.  I`m lovin` this place!"<18<10<2007<14<52<16

pBUz3XY3N8uL-tqNXFOsBw<v2WrKPkRI1TikXDKAi8VFw<Z0YOHYA6YtW131xULbnMzQ<3<0<0<0<OK; in my previous posts, I have been extremely critical of the Market Street Cafe`s oxtail soup.  But since it came to me almost perfectly yesterday, I felt that I owed them an updated posting.  Yesterday`s oxtail soup came to me piping hot, just like I wanted it.  The oxtails were in good quantity and the meat was falling off the bone -- that is how it should be cooked.  My broth could have be seasoned a little better, but at least it had some carrots, celery, and one straw mushroom in it.  So in conclusion, it was better than perhaps the last 10 or so times that I ate it.  (BTW, I am at the Cal about 15 times a year, for the last 30-40 years.  I ALWAYS eat a bowl of the oxtail soup at least once for breakfast each trip.  So that probably equates to about a zillion bowls of oxtail soup!!! LOL.)<19<11<2019<15<17<41

I came on Yelp to compliment him, but I see he`s very popular already. While we may just be one more compliment to add to his list, I hope that he truly knows how much we appreciated him!  We`ve eaten at this red lobster many times and it`s always been pleasant and the food has been good but tonight I HAD to jump in and post my compliments to our server and to Red Lobster for hiring Cameron. Cameron was the best server I have ever had in my 37 years. From the moment we walked in to be seated he was pleasant and personable. Red Lobster - I don`t know how you snagged him, but you are very fortunate to have a staff member like Cameron. Please recognize him for his exceptional work ethic, wonderful personality and courteousness. Our 8 year old insisted we make sure to send thanks and give him a $100 tip. I couldn`t quite swing the extra $100 (though I really wish I could have) but I can certainly get on Yelp and recommend you ALL go to red lobster and cross your fingers to be seated in Cameron`s section.   The food was delicious too!  There a lot of places where you can get great food, but none of them have Cameron and we will be back!  Thank you for your amazing service Cameron!<20<6<2019<3<55<53

I really don`t like says very much but I have to say the cereal milk ice cream and crack pie were better than they were on the small screen. You know when you watch a food show and wish that you could taste it, well now you can.   I fell in love with the cereal milk ice cream. The salty corn flakes they add to the side add a much needed break from an overbearing sugar rush. Deff brings you back to being a kid eating cereal but more refined. And for you alcoholics like me they also make a cereal milk white Russians. Just take my money<11<6<2018<0<5<44

JH7se0B5zwt1g0VFMLtkHA<0Te0Xu6mAlJV0i7NIxDiAQ<Fg18KJ6zAEVLZ7jM7kJpwQ<1<5<0<1<"Negotiated for a Chevy Bolt.  They had one on the website as in transit.  I called to ask if it would be in by Nov 30th and they said yes.    We came to terms and I put $1,000 down and stopped my negotiation with other dealers.    I was handed off to a half dozen different people apparently due to meetings and sickness and days off.  They were *very* hard to reach.    On the day that I was to do the deal, I still lacked the written confirmation of the verbal agreement promised days before.  After several hours of trying to reach someone in the know (the last day of the month, so you think they would be reachable), someone finally told me they would not have the car for several days or a week and they would honor our deal.  Given the EV tax credit was going to disappear after what was to be a '"sellers market'" in December and needing to close the deal in November, I said no way.  After more hassle on my part, I was able to get the deposit refunded (I was not worried about it as it would be an easy-to-dispute credit card charge if it came to that).  I suspect that they knew all along the car would not be there on Nov 30th and lied to keep a fish on the line.  I asked for documentation showing that the car was originally scheduled for Nov 30th and I received no reply.  If they update me with documentation that I can verify with their shipper, I will gladly update this review."<9<12<2017<20<16<16

Here on Tuesday night - slow is an understatement. Appetizer wings were cold - we asked for blue cheese (which they charge extra for) came out 15 minutes after wings. Entrees - half came out and then 15 minutes later the other half came out. Waitress is a total multi-tasker - responsible for taking orders, cleaning tables, floors, and serving food. It took 15 plus minutes for dirty tables around us to be cleaned - and apparently there was something wrong in the urinal - not really sure what (and as a female didn`t want to know details). As a Cleveland native who now lives out of town - and chose the Winking Lizard as our one dinner out while in town for Thanksgiving - I am sad to say, we will not be back.

That said, I`m so pleased with Snooze.The interior is a retro, diner feel and their branding is excellent across the board throughout the whole place.  Got there at 11 am for an early lunch with a friend and there was a 15 minute or so wait..There were a few tables open, but they seem understaffed and a bit unorganized. The host & hostess were '"meh'" at best, hence the four stars instead of five.  The food: YES!!! My friend had the Benny Goodman Benedict & I had a half order Ham Benedict III (love that you can order a half portion) as well as a plain pancake with a side of bacon. The cinnamon pancake...is best described as something that you eat as dessert on Thanksgiving right before a 5 hour nap, LOL! But it`s not overly sweet.  Loved our waitress, she was so friendly and welcoming. Service was a bit slow, but I attribute that to them being understaffed - she had a lot going on. She was gracious enough to send out a cinnamon pancake on the house for us to try, because it was our first time there and she insisted that we just had to taste it.  With it being the middle of a workday, I didn`t get to try any of the drinks. But I did examine the menu.. Bacon infused bloody mary?! Better believe I`ll be back to try it!"<18<4<2017<17<57<26

Parking is a biatch, but that`s to be expected and didn`t influence this review. The servers were super friendly, but the food (and isn`t that what we all come for?) was mediocre at best. My friend had Juan`s breakfast tacos, which seemed delish by description but had ZERO flavor. I had the corned beef ruben which was passable but mostly just a salt-bomb and nothing special. We both felt sick to our stomachs after we left.

I was nervous buying from Groupon only because I didn`t want it to say I`m being cheap, and I would get what I paid for. I was very happy with my service. It felt like she took her time and got my money`s worth. I  thought the ladies were very nice and professional. I didn`t feel like they were trying to sell me '"everything'". Places I`ve been to have done this, which I never gone back ( such a turn off!)  I really thought my esthetician, Rachel was very cool and down to earth and very knowledgeable.

GZ98uZcTpBInWcRYWQLMsA<DtnRQNotXIBjOsTImNuYTQ<E3m-twP4h0-qzakUTBYDpw<3<5<1<4<This was my first ever half marathon. Like what other reviewers said, it is very hard to get to your corral in the beginning due to the amount of people that were participating in this race. I saw people shoving each other, and I saw a group of men not letting a woman get to her corral. It was very disgusting to watch.   Luckily, I didn`t have to use the portable restrooms. There were long lines to use them, and I also saw men run off to the side to go. At times, I didn`t know what mile I was on because of the few mile posts they had.   Throughout the race, volunteers were giving out water and Gatorade. This actually helped me get through the race.   There were pacers available for this race.  Overall, it was a good first half marathon for me. I do hope they fix something about the corrals next time, and possibly put more portable restrooms.   Bananas, chocolate milk, and a few other snacks were given out after the race.    I went to the Las Vegas convention center. pick up my bibs. Plenty of parking at the convention center.   Be aware that the entire strip is closed off from early morning to late night the day of the race. Plan accordingly. My friend had a flight to catch the night of my race, and she was stuck for almost two hours in traffic.<2<12<2018<18<39<57

It`s tucked away in the Southern part of the campus.  The walk to/from the parking lot is pretty far, and you might have to cut across some desert to create a shortcut.  I don`t know why they just don`t create a pathway through it.  The visitor`s seating is larger than most visitors sections in other schools in the Valley.  The field is well kept.  Our son says it`s one of the best kept fields he plays on.  The sound system and AV during the game is pretty good.    Parking is tough....great parking spaces, but if it`s a big game with a lot of people in attendance, plan to get stuck getting out of the lot.  It`s like going to a Cardinals game....will take you a while to get out.  The nice facilities will bring us back.  Return Factor - 80%<18<9<2013<12<58<49

We have been here twice and both times we had a seriously delicious sandwich and a comparably delicious shrimp summer roll.    Both times I had the pork belly bahn mi or xa xiu banh mi, which is absolutely delectable.  The bread is nice and sturdy but not too hard, while the perfectly seasoned pork belly and crunchy, acidic pickled vegetables play nicely with the fattiness of the pork.  The fresh cilantro on top just really ties this sandwich together.  All I can really say is I am sad I am not eating one right now.<31<7<2019<23<48<13

I guess I had my hopes up too much, because while it was good, it wasnt the kind of thing I`ll crave again.  It did appear to have fresh ingredients and a great cut of meat, at least for fast food.

We actually left on time (shocker) but the pilots inexplicably flew toward Nashville before turning north to Chicago. They claimed a weather issue at the end of the flight, I think they fell asleep. We were an hour and a half late, which gave me about 5 minutes to get to my connecting flight for Flint. After running through O`Hare, I reached the gate only to find out that the gate had been changed, and I missed my flight. I was then booked on a flight, leaving at 10 PM. I went to customer service, and had to get rerouted to Detroit, which forced me to do a one-way rental car with Hertz that cost me over $300 for two days. (Don`t ever go to Hertz either)  So, Monday night, I get to bed for my 6 AM flight out of Flint on Tuesday. At 1:30 AM, my phone lights up informing me that my flight had been delayed until 10 AM, then until 12 PM, then I`m re-booked altogether on a 7 PM flight into O`Hare, to fly to Tucson for midnight. I work early Wednesday morning, so I had to re-book again for a 4 PM flight, to connect to Chicago, Phoenix, then Tucson. I`ll be updating this review, but I`m sure that I won`t be getting to Tucson by 9 PM tonight as they claim. I will never fly American again, and neither should any of you. Still haven`t been able to get through to customer service.<13<8<2019<12<36<48

The serving (and calories) is enough to fill you up as a meal! Our table ordered 3 (one for each person). I also indulged in a lemon martini cocktail while we waited.   The inside of the restaurant is super nice!  They did really well on the decor and opening up the dinning room into the bar area. I especially like the the openness of the kitchen so you can see what is going on. The temperature inside though, is cold. Almost everyone inside was keeping their jackets, sweaters and long sleeves on.   Our server was pleasant - she smiled, offered to check on things for us and brought us our items. She forgot utensils when our food came out though, forgot to follow up on the checked things and our bread was Hard like it had been sitting in the warmer for hours. But overall she was A-Ok!   I really enjoyed my bang bang shrimp. There was a lot of lettuce in all three of our servings - it was more like a shrimp salad. My dad didn`t like all the lettuce but to me it was a nice balance of richness in the sauce to salad ratio.   Overall this place was A-Ok.<3<12<2019<15<46<14

Since it was recently completed within the last month everything still looks clean and brand new. They have an ordering kiosk just off to the left of the register if you`d prefer not to order from a human (haha). Parking is adequate but the drive thru always looks busy when I drive by. The customer service was ok (not great but not terrible). Also, they offer free WiFi at this Burger King. I forgot to order my sandwich plain so I had to clean up my sandwich a bit (Mayo is gross) but the chicken had a decent spice to it.

It`s a nice breath of fresh air from the typical convention center food and is basically attached to the convention center by the skywalk.   If this review was for service alone I`d rate it much higher since our waitress was so friendly and attentive, but the food quality just wasn`t entirely there for me. I had the Ruben sandwich which was a huge portion, but for the price I just don`t think it was worth it. The bread was a bit soggy and the dressing to meat ratio was way off.  Overall I`d probably come back again during trade show season and would love to see some refreshed menu items.<23<2<2017<5<26<38
S_rRWE6Uyfai-ORdBZxgmA<gr6TLOn2lEOcFZs9nXri-A<wPiRP76arN0NB3M1ZXXp7g<3<0<0<1<I wanted to love this place but came away a bit disappointed. Patrons are paying for the view and ambiance here. Not the best italian food. We purchased a Travelzoo voucher $75 for two appetizers, two entrees and a shared dessert. Even with the great deal on the voucher, the overall experience was lacking. The best I can describe our restaurant experience is - inconsistent.  Waitress was pleasant  and well informed on the menu (+) but then brought out dessert menu before the dinner was completed. She asked  if I wanted a second glass of wine when I still had half of the first glass remaining. It made us feel rushed. Like - get in and get out so we can get more customers in here. On to the food. Again, inconsistent. Appetizers: the meatballs were not good, over salted and just so, so. I would bet they were not even made in-house. Whereas the fried calamari was delicious with a tartar type sauce and marinara provided.  Entrees: inconsistent. The seafood linguine was terrific. Nice, light red marina, with wine sauce and good portion of various seafood. Yet, the pasta with the beef ragu sauce was so bad it was almost inedible. It was like dried, days-old, ground beef and almost no sauce. I only ate a couple of bites of it. Yuck! How can you mess up beef ragu sauce for goodness sake? That is pretty basic italian. Dessert: good. We ordered the chocolate cake with sea salt caramel gelato. The gelato was the star here. The cake was tasty yet served cold.  I would have expected it to be served warm or even room temp.  Now, here is the part that upset my husband the most. Here we are in this lovely restaurant. Waitress asks for voucher. I show her the voucher and barcode on my phone. She has to send the manager over to scan the code (All good so far). After he scans it, he tells me needs a pin number for the voucher. I`ve never needed a pin code for a voucher. I politely responded that I needed a moment to find it in my Travelzoo app and asked for a moment to locate it (hint, hint *  please give me a moment and step away). He stands there, right at the table, with his mini flashlight shining on my phone for 2-3 minutes, while I am trying to find it in the app. My husband was appalled. We felt they are going for a classy feel but lacked etiquette. Overall, this place was inconsistent. I would only return for drinks and dessert but not a meal. We enjoyed Yardbird (Southern food) inside Venetian much more as the food and service were superb.<8<9<2019<2<45<36

I ordered one meat lovers omelette with hash browns and one macro breakfast with scrambled eggs,potatoes,bacon,chocolate chip pancakes and white toast. Everything was great with the omelette but the macro breakfast was another story. When my boyfriend opened the take out container with the eggs and potatoes he noticed one long black hair wrapped around the eggs and potatoes which was disgusting but it was easy to just discard that portion of food. But then he started cutting the eggs he noticed another hair that was actually COOKED into his eggs!!!!! It`s absolutely disgusting!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He was not able to eat anything but the bacon and pancakes since they were in a separate container but still it`s absolutely APPALLING!!! Such poor hygiene and how do you '"not notice'" that as you`re cooking and placing into the container?!?!   So obviously the first thing we did was call Micro Diner immediately and let them know the situation and when the lady answered the phone and we explained how disgusted we were and how we wasted money to only eat half of what we ordered and if we could get a refund or come down and just get it remade she said '"oh we must not have noticed. We can`t do anything.'"  She also seemed like she wasn`t surprised like she`s heard of this before which is more sickening. Absolutely pathetic and not even worth the argument. We won`t even step foot in that filthy restaurant ever again."<31<3<2019<14<48<54

Everyone likes to blame Amazon for big box stores like this going under but here is one of the key reasons why... customer service!!!! Awful experience. My family and I spent about 30 minutes looking around their movie section trying to find a box set for the Avengers movies. We could not find anyone to even acknowledge us to help us. Why you ask? Because all of the employees were standing around talking to each other and playing on their phones. The first picture I took shows 4 employees all together!  There is really something I love about going to the store and being able to find what I`m looking for and walk out with it in hand being able to use it the same day... but I absolutely hate wasting my time like this. And after this experience, I will definitely not be returning to Best Buy in the future. I will go first to Amazon next time and oh look!

I arrived at 6:15pm when their service department closes at 7pm we were greeted by service advisor Carlos and we explained to them our situation about how we had to get back to Los Angeles that evening and he was emphatic and concerned for us. He immediately paged any available technicians to see who had not left for the evening as the service department was closed on Sunday. We felt he understood the urgency of our situation.   They found Loel a service technican who came to help us, we explained the problem with our gauge and just wanted to know if the car was safe to drive back to Los Angeles as we did not want to get stranded in the middle of the desert at 2am. Loel immediately took our car in the back and examined the car and was able to find the problem within 15 minutes!! He said there was oil on the oil temperature sensor likely from the last oil change we did a few days prior and recommended we replace the sensor which we did and it fixed the problem, he diagnosedit and installed it in under 20 minutes, as for any catastrophic engine failures as reported by AA Autocare he stated that that was not the case. Daniel drove our car out, he was also very courteous and washed our car for us even though it was after 7pm, he dried it and we were on our way.   We definately recommend United Nissan they seem to genuinely care about their customers even though we were from out of town. AA Autocare states they are the dealership alternative but with their poor customer service and lack of knowledge with basic automotive repair we would not recommend their shop, especially when dealing with later model high performance cars. This is a warning for other drivers if you care about your car avoid AA Autocare 4005 E Desert Inn Rd, Las Vegas, NV 89121 and take your car to United Nissan instead it will save you half a day and a huge headache.  For further reference I HIGHLY recommend viewing my nightmare experience of AA Autocare 4005 E Desert Inn Rd, Las Vegas, NV 89121 on their yelp page they are the worst!!<13<11<2019<2<33<7

I come again with my boyfriend on a Saturday during lunch time, we seat ourselves and a waitress comes up and asked for our drink orders. After telling her she asks if we`re both 21, my bf says yes and I just shake my head no. Then she said oh are you married, we say no. She then says oh well you have to be 21 and above to be/eat here and if you`re not you have to be accompanied by a parent or guardian. Which I totally understand age restrictions but come on! It`s a slow Saturday during lunch, I`m just trying to grab a bite to eat, I`m not trying to order drinks and it`s not 11 o`clock at night, the places also says a '"restaurant and pub'" I am an adult why can I not eat here? I was even more mad and confused because there was a family with 2 little children sitting in high chairs. I don`t understand this rule they have and it makes absolutely no sense to me. I have worked and been a customer to places more of a bar or whatever they want to call it than this place. For that reason I will never be returning because I just think it is absolutely ridiculous, and that makes me sad."<4<11<2019<21<41<17

I was looking for a new dentist and heard the radio ad, and figured why not. The most important thing to me back then was that they let parents go back with their children. As someone who was yelled at and threatened by a pediatric dentist as a child, this was very important to me.     I cannot tell you how wonderful Dr. DiBartola and his staff are! They are prompt, kind, gentle, understanding, and the office is beautiful. When my 10 year old recently needed a cavity filled and was very nervous, Dr. DiBartola put her at ease and let her be in control of the procedure. It turned what could have been a terrifying procedure into a safe and relieving experience.     Whether you have a fear of dentists or you are a parent who wants their child to have positive dentistry experiences, Dr. DiBartola and his staff are seriously the best around. I drive out of my way to get here twice a year, and it is worth it!<19<7<2016<20<16<13
EdLtoyWkX8nNEgXPkX-L7A<z6vN2RkLbY8cv3QUw0EDiA<MgSd4P3ATkiywbbraFygHg<2<0<2<0<"I went to this place to try it out last week and I was pretty disappointed. There are a lot of kinks to work out in terms of logistics. I went there to place my order after work- (so like 6pm during the workweek) and it`s not busy at all. I go to place my order and the cashier, a blonde girl, says '"Hold on! I`m not ready yet!'" The thing is, I hadn`t said a word. I was `holding on`...not the greatest first impression, but young people get stressed out easily. I just wait until she is ready. Finally, she calls me over and then as soon as I start to speak she tells me to hold on again so she can answer the phone. Meanwhile, there are like 25 employees all everywhere trying to create a fun environment but just trying too hard and making it super awkward. One guy asks me my name, I tell him and then he tells the rest of the staff and they keep saying my name every  chance they get thinking this is somehow a catchy marketing ploy? I`m not sure but it was obnoxious. So finally, girl is off the phone and I`m ready to order now. Then, the phone rings again- no apologies, nothing.  She just answers. I`m visibly pissed and she recognizes that so she placed the caller on hold this time so I could finally order. After about a 10 minute dance with her, I place my order. Sandwich and individual pizza. She tells me 30 mins. What?!? Jesus! I paid already so whatever- I decide to drive directly across the street to Von`s to pick up some stuff. I haven`t even parked... Less than 5 minutes had passed and some man calls and tells me my order is ready and to come pick it up. I ask him how that`s possible? 5 mins ago, I was told 30 mins. He repeated my order to me. I confirmed and he said yup, ready. Weird but ok. Even better. So I go across the street again- (if you know this area, you know how impossible this can be during this time of day) and I finally make it and go to pick up my order. I get there and, of course, my order was not ready. They did however, say my name at least 20 more times to add to this lovely experience. I finally got my food. It was correct and edible which is why they get two stars. Mediocre quality at best. Two stars is generous, trust me. Soggy pizza and bland sandwich.   Suggestion: Service matters as much, if not more than the product. Please keep your eyes on the face of your business. (Ashley, I think was her name) Also, invest in some salt and pepper and make sure all moving parts are communicating with each other so you have a decent shot at a first impression. Finally, quality control. Pizza was super soggy because it was not timed to be ready when the sandwich was.   Best of luck to you folks- I love supporting mom and pop shops- hopefully this experience was the exception and not the rule."<9<2<2017<8<36<29

We were greeted at the hostess stand by two young ladies. The four if us were seated immediately. We sat indoors, there was a wait for the patio.  Carmie, our delightful server, came right over to the table and introduced herself. She took our drink orders, mimosas for the ladies ($8 extra for endless) and coffee for the gentlemen. We all decided to have the brunch. It is very cool how it is small plates, like a buffet, but you never have to get up from the table. At this point Carmie took over our experience. She anticipated all of our needs, she took the liberty of starting us off with a few things, and when she saw that we were all sharing and passing plates and having fun, she just kept them coming. She brought mimosa refils right on time. Just as my colleague was about to place his empty coffee cup on the table, she was filling it up. IT WAS AMAZING!!!! Before we knew it we had tried one of everything. Carmie asked if we wanted seconds on anything. We ordered two more things and tapped out.  Outstanding service!! The food was so good that I didn`t even think to take pictures of it.... everything was incredible. Must trys: brisket omelet, breakfast fries, French toast, biscuits and gravy & of course ALL THE MIMOSAS!!! Thanks Carmie!!! We`ll be back!<30<9<2013<3<26<56

Kastler who did my crowns but I`m Quite suspicious that they pulled a bait and switch when they told me that I was upgraded to the Zirconia but several times I was told the material used was different From one Tooth to another (top to bottom) and I can see the difference but their excuse was that it was the lighting?  So I spent nearly $30,000 to get caps and four implants and the problem started when one doctor did the crowns and another doctor did the implants.   You would think they would use the same lab so the teeth would match and look the same.   Dr. Olster who did my implants either doesn`t care about his work or doesn`t have an eye for aesthetics so I requested to have them changed out and match the others in look and color which the front desk agreed to but when I came back for the work to be done that`s when the runaround started and after two doctors refusing to do anything I was asked to make an appointment again with Dr. Olster to finish the last two Implants.  Dr Olster basically told me he would not do anything to Rectify the issue so why would I want to see him again.  basically I lost all confidence and don`t trust that he would finish the job to my satisfaction.   Buyer beware use your due diligence.  Sincerely, Mario the unhappy customer<6<10<2019<13<1<52

God forbid you ask the Doc extra questions about your health like I did and I received a response of '"now you made me late for my next appointment and now I will have to stay up late tonight to work on patient files'". yep she said that. Then there is Laura the PA who is rude as well. I had gone to her because I thought I had a kidney infection, she walked up to me and pounded on my kidneys, she said if you had one you would have jumped! ugh really that is how they taught you in school to check for kidney infections?!  This office charges 50.00 for no show appointments. I had contacted the so called wannabe office Manager Michelle to discuss my husbands account. I tried to explain to her that her office called and said they would credit his account and she flat out called me a liar. She said nobody from her office called and said that because it was not noted in the computer. I tried to explain what happened that day with my husband and she would not listen. She just continued on with her unprofessional immature attitude and words. My husband would not lie! This office is losing patients like no other because of Michelle`s inability to manage this office. The reviews posted here speak for themselves. They are true and accurate! The reason why the staff is rude is because it trickles down from Michelle`s unprofessional attitude and inability to manage in what used to be a nice office to visit."<15<3<2016<4<5<55

But, luckily my friend put the brakes on me and we ended up at Midwood Smokehouse which was roughly 13 minutes away. Saweeeeeeet!  The grub:  Smoked Wings-super tasty and smokey and almost tasted like bacon! I don`t eat swine, so having something that brought me back to my bacon eating days gave me all types of life. My only gripe was that the skin was chewy and gooie as if the fat hadn`t rendered out. However, I`ll totally go back for these.  Burnt Ends-these were tasty as well. There were fatty pieces attached to brisket ends and covered in BBQ sauce. These didn`t blow my mind, but they were tasty.  Hush puppies-delicious, we got more to go.  Coleslaw-this was more of a vinegar based coleslaw then mayonnaise based. I actually didn`t mind it! It`s a nice compliment and the vinegar helped but through the fatty foods.  Soooooo I didn`t get any pics because the greedy hunger was real when the food arrived :). This place is worth giving a go!<27<6<2019<12<29<0

m7VlTVZZy0m58Cnue43PnQ<wMyFYszojTuVbfJuWSINOg<9Yo5Fl8wstZlxBnD0G-uHg<1<1<1<0<: A true Arby`s experience     To whom it may concern at Arby`s home office.  I am not a member of the media but I thought I would go over a series of events today, 7-4-19, at the Arby`s on McKnight Road in Pittsburgh Pa around 1pm.  My wife and I go to Arby`s in the Pgh area for fish sandwiches, gyros, chicken sandwiches, etc. many times a year.  We went in today on McKnight Rd and ordered the 2 for $5 chicken.  I then asked the cashier at the counter for our two free small curly fries as part of the Pgh Pirates` promo regarding stolen bases from the previous day`s game.   The cashier (who said later that she was another manager there) stated that the offer was only good for that day`s game.  She said that for night games you had to come in before a store closed that evening to get the deal.  I told her that this was not correct and showed her on my phone the rules and that you had to come in the next day to claim the deal.  I asked for the manager and she said she was one of two managers there at that time.  The second manager said the main office would not allow her access to that function any more on the register and that the main office also told her the deal was only good for that day`s game anyway.  I asked her for the district managers name and phone or to call that person and she refused to do either of these requests.   Also she said that we were raising our voices and asked us to leave or she would call the police.    We again asked for the deal and we would then go. ( I had already paid for and received our chicken.)  The taller manager then called the Ross Twp. police but we were in the right so we were going to wait until they came.  The cashier/manager said directly to me that I was begging for the free food and she said directly to my wife that my wife was too fat and did not need the free food anyway.  The police came quickly and we spoke with an officer and a sergeant for a time inside and outside of the restaurant. As we were walking out the door with the police, my wife saw the two managers looking and laughing at us from behind the counter. We then drove off.  I know we are just two of the many millions of customers that Arby`s and the Pittsburgh Pirates (by association) have in their markets, but to be treated so poorly and insulted in front of everyone in your establishment as the normal and approved employee/customer experience and interaction process apparently `is what it is`.   Sadly, sincerely and truthfully yours,   David W  0 stars of course, but yelp required something.<5<7<2019<2<18<26

The prices would suggest you are going to get a haircut like you might get in any upscale, elite SALON in a major metropolitan area! The level of expertise or knowledge of hair cutting (at Pur) is on the level of a kindergarten student with a dull pair of preschool scissors! Actually, the kindergartener would probably do a better job! This is a place with near failing cosmetology students getting 5- 6 times the monetary amount of what their talent actually reflects!

For years, my golfing buddies said: It`s too far, too hot/cold, too windy, etc. All of that was complete nonsense. There was a slight breeze upon our arrival, but it subsided at the 4th hole on the Sun Course. Drinks were fairly priced, pro shop staff was very helpful, and Earl the starter made our day.

We were able to be seen right away and were both super happy with the service. The staff was really friendly - Stacy did a beautiful job on my mom`s gel manicure and Sean went above and beyond with my mani/pedi. I had some serious calluses on my feet that needed work and my feet felt so soft afterwards. I felt like they did a lot of extra stuff that most other places would try and upsell you and charge extra for. The prices were fair and the place was very nice and clean. This location is in an awkwardly designed shopping center that makes it hard to find which is a real shame, since it may affect the influx of customers for them. I guess that makes it a hidden gem! I highly recommend this place for their nail services.<3<12<2019<22<34<37

I waited 30 min. Then my insurance wouldn`t go through.  Ended up paying out of pocket. Called insurance.  No issue at all. Now I have to go back and fight to get reimbursed.  Not friendly.

I love the look of it, I love weird toys and collectibles and the pretty lights and the tiny lovely cosy space. When I popped in recently with a group of 8, just to see if they might have time for us to grab a round of oysters and drinks before dinner, they squeezed us in and it was super helpful and fun.   The oysters were fresh and delicious, and there were a couple near-beer options for the preggos, and tasty glasses of bubbly and wine for the others.   Small bémol: The people in our group who were excited to order local beers were disappointed to find they were served warm, and there were astonished laughs at the table over the 20$ hot dog. Fair enough.   I definitely still dig this bar and have had some great times here, I just wish the menu were more appealing and filling, and things in general just a little more consistent. I think I`d be there way more often.<15<5<2018<16<26<11

Since then the issues I`ve had is maintenance taking forever to fix things and when they do don`t clean up after themselves . Also one of the maintenance men defecated in my toilet and didn`t flush . Also there is a resident in our apartment building whom is stealing not only line but others packages and the office said there was nothing they could do about it . Which no one should live here that does that . Hall ways always smell disgusting...  the water pressure sucks and frequently hot water goes out . the only thing that i do love that our apartment was very up to date , clean , spacious , and best part no bugs !! I know I`ve read that a lot of people have had big problems but we have not . So i will rate this a 2 stars . But seriously thieves should be immediately evicted and the workers need to have some class when coming into someone`s home. (Btw i still have a hole in my wall from the maintenance man replacing the towel bar) policies and procedures need to be implemented. If things don`t change i don`t see why i would stay here longer than a year , i really don`t want to have to find another place so I`m hoping it gets better and i can give the Alden 5 stars<20<9<2019<14<57<56

I heard through the grapevine to make reservations and I am glad that I did.  6:30 on a Sat night and it was packed, the bar, the outside patio, and the dining area, hardly a free table in the house.  I loved the decor-- like I was visiting a family member`s house in the South which made the place a very family/kid friendly environment.  The wait staff was very friendly and attentive even with the place being so busy. Some one was always asking us for refills and giving us an update on our order.The tables were busy quickly and often.  I ordered the grilled salmon which was a very large piece of fish and a huge side of vegetables-cooked perfectly. My other half ordered a pulled pork sandwich. The mashed potatoes were a hit at our table.  We didn`t have room for dessert so next time we may just order appetizers and dessert. As we left a small band was setting up in the bar area... This place was going to be rocking for hours to come. (PS. our bill came out to $50.77 so that was perfect deal with our gift card)<26<5<2013<16<12<19

I recently relocated from Phoenix to Henderson for my new job. I have Crohn`s Disease and take medications to help manage it. I waited a month until my appointment. I was pleasantly surprised by the friendliness of the front desk staff and the coziness of the waiting area. I filled out the new patient paperwork and waited to be called. I waited about 25 minutes until I was called.  Once back in the exam room, I had a really nice medical assistant who took my vitals and completed my check in. Next, I saw Dr Farris. To say I was impressed by this professional, esteemed doctor is a misnomer. Dr Farris is well spoken, calm, kind, caring and friendly. He is both knowledgeable and investigative--he asked me a lot of questions and looked over my paperwork from my previous gastroenterologist from Scottsdale.  He ordered labs, wrote prescriptions, gave me instructions and informed me what he is testing me for. He asked me to return in three weeks. I feel good about my care. I highly recommend Dr Farris for your gastrointestinal care.<8<12<2018<6<17<34

EFM--QJb_nag3Eki4nup1g<mRGTI0l7jI2gK0iCICSNwA<joZGNAL7lKyazSzxkOAi6Q<1<2<0<0<I would like the owner Lisa Memberr to contact me. I spoke to the managers daughter this morning, she has my contact information.  I have shopped at Sunny`s for many years but tonight I was treated with such disrespect, it is hard to put into words. I purchased hair at Sunny`s a few weeks ago and just needed a few ounces to fill in. After waiting for the worker to finish playing with her son, who was perched on top of the glass display near the register, she reluctantly came to assist me. I picked out a bundle and we went to the register to pay. I let her know I was purchasing 2 ozs of the 4 oz bundle.  She took my card at the counter and ran it and had me sign before preparing the bundle.   As she was unravelling the bundles I noted that they were sticking together more than usual and had tons of white residue. I commented that the weft appeared used and asked to take a closer look. She quickly said no refunds, which was odd because I was still in the store, hadn`t touched the hair, and didn`t ask for a refund. After taking a closer look, I did ask if I could pick a different bundle and she told me no because she cut the gold ribbon and would not be able to sell it anymore. I told her that made little sense, given the fact I purchased only half the bundle, they would have to find some way to package and sell the other half. I have purchased pre-cut bundles here before so I know it is possible. She disagrees and gets an attitude and tells me all sales are final. I explain there was no way for me to see the inside of the weft before she unrolled it, I am not asking for my money back just different hair. She refuses and has a rude and indignant tone.  I asked her if she was the manager or owner, she said no. I asked for the  manager she tells me there is no manager there she is on vacation and refuses to tell me the managers name.  She then refuses to tell me her name, refuses to give me the name of a manager and threatens to call the police on me. I say for her to go ahead and call the police because I have done nothing wrong. I asked another employee for the managers name and she stated I just started working here I don`t know.   A customer then intervened and told me to just call back and request the managers name, which I will do;  however as a paying (long term) customer I cannot believe how I was treated tonight. She was incredibly rude and her conduct was abhorrent and I will be following up with management and anyone else necessary as a consumer in Arizona- including with the attorney general because the whole course of events felt fraudulent as though she was trying to conceal something. It`s not about the money. I will never shop at Sunny`s again- but the employee did tell me on my way out that I am banned and cannot shop there anymore and that her manager allows her to bring her son with her to work at night. I hope management will respond to this review and follow up with both me and the employee.<23<11<2019<1<12<2

This was a fun find because they start playing live music at 8pm.  For us we are looking to start having fun a little earlier.  It is a free cover with a 2 drink minimum.  Drinks were expensive but worth it.  We really enjoyed being able to sit and enjoy the show.   The dance floor was a bit crowded because they had chairs around it.  Also weird to be dancing right in front of someone sitting.  The Pop 40 band was very good.  They played great songs we all knew.  A little too much Elton John and Bruce Springsteen .  Dancing came to a halt on these songs!    The next act came on an Orchestra show.  Great dynamics and a talented group.  It was a bit too loud but fun!

First, I try to use the valet service & Michelle tells me that they have no parking. Clearly, there is tons of parking spots (please see pictures). Then I ask can I park in a valet spot & she tells me no. I ask Michelle if she will not allow me to park in the empty spot, will she at least call the clinic I was visiting to tell them I may be late. Michelle tells me no, because she doesn`t have a walkie-talkie.   I end up finding parking nearby, & head up to the second floor for my appointment in Internal Medicine. I check in 15 minutes early (1345). It`s now 1430 & I`ve watched every person come in after me get taken back. I go up to the clerk, because there`s a sign that mentions '"if you haven`t had your viral taken 15 minutes prior to your appointment, see clerk'" (please see picture'".  I tell the clerk I haven`t had my vitals taken. She tells me to have a seat & someone will grab me shortly. It`s now 1450, I go up again, this time asking for a Patient Advocate.  Now the clerk decides this is the time she will ask me for my last name & social. She looks me up in the system & yells, '"Oh shoot!'". The clerk said that if she would have looked me up sooner, she would have seen that she was supposed to direct me to prosthetics.  Again, I ask her for the Patient Advocate & I ask for her name as well (Tiffany). She tells me she doesn`t think there is a Patient Advocate, & I tell her that every clinic should have one. She writes the number down & tell me to go to Prosthetics. It`s now 1500. I find someone & ask them how to get to prosthetics. I go check in, & Dolores tells me to have a seat. I ask how long will this be, since I`ve been here over an hour & she says she doesn`t know. I ask her for an estimate, & she makes a phone call. Then Dolores replies, go to the 6th floor. I ask, where on the 6th floor. Again, she says the 6th floor. Then a gentleman comes up from behind her & tells me the sleep lab.  I walk to the elevators & see that there are only two levels. Finally I find the elevators that go to the 6th floor. I get a phone call from a staff member saying that he will check me in. I have a seat in the waiting room. After 30 mins of waiting, Christian comes back to tell me that he can`t adjust the settings on my CPAP. I didn`t see a provider or anything. I literally waited all this time for someone to take my CPAP & tell me there is nothing to be done, because there is no data.   When I made the appointment, I was very clear by saying I needed to have my CPAP adjusted because it was too much air pressure that made it impossible to sleep with, so I never used it. I received the machine right before I was medically retired & never had any follow-up appointments/adjustments. I waited months for an appointment that didn`t even happen.  Ultimately, I wasted over two hours for no reason, five if you count the drive there & back. I did not see a provider, no vitals were taken, & my issue wasn`t resolved. I even left a message for the patient advocate Tim. I called back & left a second message for him, because no one has followed up with me. The customer service  & Care here is nonexistent."<10<12<2019<15<37<7

There is a buffet or you can order from their extensive menu. We opted to order from the menu, but the buffet looked super yummy. The worker (I believe he was a college student as well) was extremely nice and gave us a try of a dish from the buffet. We were so impressed we ordered it as an appetizer!  You can choose the spice level 0-10 and I chose a 3 fo my dish. It was a perfect spice level for me, but my boyfriend got a level 6 spice level and loved it!

My mom goes here and likes her experience every time so I went with her a few months ago and my experience was not the best. I decided to meet her there two days ago for a mani/pedi and give them another chance. The man who did my nails was very rough during the pedicure scrub and orange portion and I had asked him to use less pressure to which he just nodded his head and kept the same amount. During my mani he never spoke a word to me and never asked if I wanted my nails a certain shape. His application of the color is sub par and he actually made me bleed on three different fingers from the cuticle clippers. After, he used a brush to clean up the edges of my nails from polish and smudged two of the nails.

We looked up some travel lists on things to do in Toronto and this was on pretty much all of them!! We decided to buy the City Pass, which includes tickets here, as well as, tickets to several other Toronto tourist spots - highly recommend this if you are staying in the area and doing a couple things!  The only big downer was the parking lot and attendant. We pulled into the lot and there was no signage that it was full. The attendant was not helpful at all. We asked where else we could park in the area and she basically told us that it was our problem to figure out, maybe try the school area. Okay? Not the best start.   When we found parking a few blocks away, it was $10 and we walked on over. Once inside, it was great! The inside was spacious and bright. There were optional (free) audio tour guides, which I would say you should get, cause it really helps bring the house back to life.   There was a wedding taking place in the atrium area, which was gorgeous, so clearly this would be a good venue! The bummer about it was that it meant it was off limits for the tour, so we couldn`t go in there, but it looked nice.   There were multiple floors and plenty to see. They have tons of original items on view for furniture, paintings, books, etc. Made it feel very museum like.   Overall: A After a not great parking lot beginning, it was a great tour, and very neat and different from the usual tourist type things.<17<10<2019<17<58<1

After picking out a new setting for my engagement ring and a new wedding band, my husband and the salesman agreed on a price and shook hands.  We went through a very long process of them extracting the diamond from my current ring, weighing it and evaluating it.  Then we get to the point of paying and the price comes up at $1700 more than the agreed upon price.  When we point this out to the salesman, he says it was his mistake but this is the price.  He then went in the back to talk to his manager and came out saying they could take another small percent off because of his mistake but that was all they could do.  This felt very shady and like a giant scam...that after you have invested all this time in the process, they switch the price on you.  We had them put my ring back together and left. The price was not the point but the slimy feeling of the experience. No manager ever came to talk to us and quite frankly it didn`t even seem like they cared that much.   Horrible experience and on the day of my 20th anniversary.<17<10<2019<12<59<16

The place was empty but there was loud talking and cooking sounds coming from the kitchen as if the place was packed. I order sesame chicken with lo main and soup. My husband ordered beef and broccoli.  We waited forever for our food, again we were the only people in there. The food arrived in take out containers , which was fine however the food was hot , temperature hot, it was inedible . We waited a while and blew on it to cool down, still it was scorching hot. I burnt the roof of my mouth trying to eat a piece of chicken .  The food was BLAND so my efforts were for nothing . My husbands food was just as bland and tasteless.  Then they brought us out soup which again was to hot even after blowing on it.  I`m sure there is a health violation for serving food at 900 degrees . I think the only way to get the food that hot is by a microwave . We won`t be back ever. China Go Go is China No No.<2<10<2016<14<2<17

As I go in I see the selection and I start to look around like ok where are the real donuts or where is the real stash.    Sadly the photo I snapped is all they had.  It was 7:10 pm and they close at 9 pm.  So I`m assuming that they stop making donuts at a certain time.  I asked the manager if that was all they had and he stated yes.  You`d think that a donut joint would have a wide selection of donuts.  Not this location.  The search continues.......<28<12<2014<3<21<54

They offer $5 beers, $6 wells, $7 wine by the glass. What won me over were the $20 select bottles of wine... a steal for happy hour!   If you`re a charcuterie lover, ordering The Bin board is 100% necessary ($30). The portion size doesn`t disappoint and is great for a group of 2-4 to share. It comes with 3 different meats, 3 different cheeses, and an assortment of spreads (honeycomb, fig jelly, grainy mustard), marinated olives, candied nuts, and dried fruit. Served with bread - which they will happily replenish if requested.  Can`t wait to come back for another happy hour!!<9<10<2019<23<40<49

It saved him stress and I get cake! Can you tell I love cake?  I haven`t had a bad one yet.  The vanilla cake with layers of raspberry puree and buttercream frosting has been my choice every year.  When I find something I like, I stick with it. The cake layers are always moist so every bite is decadent.  I just can`t get enough.    I have yet to try any of their other pastries and desserts.

Well, not early enough for Snooze! I came here with my mom then and was told that there was already a 1.5 hour wait. We ended up coming back the next day, Monday, at 6:45 AM--with NO WAIT!  The food was great and our waiter was super nice and asked us if we had any questions and gave great recommendations. I ended up getting the pancake flight with the Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup, Sweet Potato, and Peach Pie pancakes. All were great, but I think my favorite was the sweet potato pancake because it wasn`t overwhelmingly sweet.   Additionally, as my mom and I were waiting for our food, we were brought a ~complimentary~ cinnamon roll pancake. It was everything we could`ve dreamed of...and also the reason I couldn`t finish my whole pancake flight!   Overall, great! The coffee, food, and service were all spectacular. However, hearing people say they waited 2+ hours? I am skeptical. I would personally not wait that long for here-- I think the hype will die down in a few months. You`d be better off starting your day with a great breakfast early (i.e. before 7 AM) rather than waiting for hours.<2<9<2016<21<2<37
tw3Iw64NmettP0Id7pGmuw<FBvZwNAk3QgJACzqbw5ikA<utIA0LyQmwP-9DRyxUe6qQ<5<1<0<0<Snooze is hands down my favorite breakfast/brunch place in Houston. The only reason I was tempted to give anything less than 5 stars is the wait on weekends (1-2hrs). During week days there is usually very minimal wait. They do have a self serve coffee machine, so you can put your name in and grab some caffeine while you wait. They also have plenty of games to entertain yourself with, or order a cocktail at the bar to enjoy. Just know going in on a weekend it will always be over an hour until you are seated.  I have tried 10+ things on the menu and have yet to find something I dislike. My personal favorites are the Bella Bella Benny and the Cinnamon Roll Pancake. The bacon at Snooze is to die for- it is thick and perfectly well cooked, so you can`t go wrong ordering something with bacon!  As a pro tip, the Cinnamon Roll pancake is for some reason not listed under the pancake section at the Houston locations. It is actually a la carte so many people miss it. However, it is by far the best pancake so I highly recommend it! You can also get it topped with bacon chunks if you want...    They have a gluten free version of the cinnamon roll pancake that is actually very similar in taste to the gluten equivalent so if you are gluten intolerant I highly recommend.<9<4<2018<2<4<31

Literally everything tastes good from the drinks to the dessert. I was with a group of 5 and we ordered the prickly pear drinks, a sampling of everything on the menu it seemed, and the banana dessert. It was all so. Good. We were full to the brim, but we didn`t want to stop eating. We left nothing and we rolled out of that restaurant in a food coma. It was totally worth it.   The service there was great and the décor is very tasteful Southwest. I felt like I was in an interior design magazine editor`s home. There is free parking as it`s in a strip mall and they do not take reservations. You can order drinks ahead of time though while you wait. We went on a weeknight around 6:30pm and we waited about half and hour, so it really wasn`t so bad. If you`re in Phoenix you must go there!<21<9<2019<22<27<0

It was a soggy,  wet pancake.  It took 45 minutes to arrive - instead of apologizing for the delay, our server told me that it `takes a long time to bake because it`s made from scratch`.  (Um. It`s a pancake that takes 7 minutes in an oven. ) At 18$, ZERO stars. The Lobster Spaghetti 44$ was very good, tasty, creamy sauce, a couple nice pieces of lobster meat, pasta al dente - it was polished off, 5 stars. My Trout 32$ was lovely and simple, undercooked but properly so, sitting on a bed of steamed and lightly seasoned leeks.  If the trout had been served warm instead of tepid/cool, it would have been 4 stars. The chocolate slice with berries $16 was silky and very sweet but nothing special, 3 stars. Our server was polite but insincere - I didn`t appreciate the poor excuse on the dessert, which he had promised would be spectacular. He saw my son barely touched it but charged the full $18 without offering something else.  I love dessert and crepes but it was like wet eggy sponge. Had our server taken care of the issue, we might be back for the lobster pasta, but as it is, No.  Our server was not interested in our overall experience (maybe because we didn`t order alcohol?).  We also had to wait for the bill (though we had asked for it earlier) while he vivaciously talked up the table next to us who had ordered a couple bottles of wine, 1 star."<13<11<2019<1<53<41

Came to this location a few times. Was unlucky and got a nail on the drive home and went right to the establishment. As I had gotten a new car, they hadn`t put tires on this one yet. It was close to closing time and I asked if they would mind putting my spare on for me and I would just come back in the morning due to the time. A very nice work stated they would and the others just started complain stating he could have said no and so on very loudly. I get it it was closing time, But I didn`t have a jack in the car and was losing air fast. Many of us have jobs that result in not being out exactly on time and a tire change would not taken long, I was going to help. I requested to be topped off with air since it went flat in this time, got home and put the spare in myself once I was home and had access to a jack. Safety is not a priority at this location. I will not get tires from this company ever again. Glad I sold my car that has all the tires under their warranty. However I am sure if it wasn`t closing they would have pushed me to buy two tires for safety.<5<12<2019<18<58<52

My one tip is that when they ask you what level of spice you want (1-10), subtract 3 from whatever you think you want. My husband and I love spicy food, but he was really shocked by the level of heat in the level-6 papaya salad. (As in, he had to excuse himself to get some fresh air before powering through and enjoying the other dishes.) There were a million things that we wanted to try, but we settled on these four, and managed to finish all four dishes between the two of us.  We enjoyed:  * Papaya salad - As mentioned above, a 6 was very, very spicy. Worth it, though! * Nam kao tod - Crispy rice appetizer with a uniquely sour taste.  * Drunken noodles with soft shell crab - Flat noodles with fried soft shell crab. * Panang curry with crispy duck - The creamy curry amazingly did not affect the crispiness of the duck skin.   The service was excellent, and we enjoyed a nice bottle of Riesling with our meal. Very much worth the cab ride from the Strip.<29<5<2013<4<54<16

I really wanted to give this 5 stars but there were a few things that really threw me off. First off it took forever to be served! They requested we arrive 30 minutes before the belly dancing show, which we did. In that time we ordered our food, waiting for the show. We got there at 8:30 but didn`t get served and entertained until 10:30/10:45! The food came out around 9:50 and while it was amazing we were starving by then and getting more and more tired.   Finally the dancer came out, and she was lovely. The space was a bit small but she made it work well. She did two performances so this sort of compensated for the long wait. They also only have one restroom, which is usually fine but with the dancer getting ready for her acts and patrons attempting to use the restroom it made it very congested. While they informed us the dancer was running late it would have been nice if they had offered free refreshments instead of starving us between courses.   The menu is VERY small, two options for each course. Both options were really amazing so no complaints but be sure you really like the menu otherwise you`ll be screwed. I would say their food was the best part, the performance was nice but the service needs some serious help!<9<12<2019<1<56<10

I just wanted to ask how I should tape it and she proceeded to be kind and just do it for me).  Well the blonde broad speaks up and says '"you`re not supposed to be doing that for her.'" The lady helping me says '"I know. Just trying to help her out. It was only a little tape'"  Blonde broad says '"she needs to be taping her packages herself'" very rudely and as if I wasn`t even there!!!!!  So damn rude. If you have something to say to me, say it TO ME. Not speak about me as if I`m not even standing there. It has to be one of the rudest things to do to someone. While the front desk lady was being kind and trying to be helpful for the community, you have another one standing behind her being a major snot. Not caring about anyone but herself! She also glared at me which I didn`t appreciate. I offered to get my tape but the front desk lady said '"it`s okay. I can do this real quick'"  I plan to get the names of both of them and update my review with their names because good people deserve to be recognized and bad people deserve to be recognized too.

I USED to stop in here to pick up To Go orders, frequently, to take downtown. I had so many issues but it was the closest location on my way downtown so I kept going, knowing in advance something was going to go South and it always did so I`m Done!   I always ordered online and the order was always wrong. Once, I got downtown we realized there was no bun on the cheeseburger, just a lonely hamburger laying there baring itself with a little cheese. That was a WTF moment for for sure.  Then there were missing fries or no sauce, incorrect sauce, missing chicken tenders.... The list goes on.  I started checking the order before I left the checkout and then the wait was longer because of course the order was wrong so I got to wait some more.  And let`s not forget when I ordered online and it will tell me what time the order would be ready, WRONG, It was never ready and it was anywhere from a 15 to 30 minute wait, passed the original time.  I was fool enough to eat inside, twice I think, but the level of disgust was too much. The place is filthy and I don`t mean a few paper straw papers on the floor dirt. I mean deep down and dirty been there for years dirt. Not unlike another BDUBS I live near. I have to wonder what might be lurking in the kitchen.  I get the place is swarming with college students and servers etc are students but at some point Management at least needs to play adult, do your job and get this place cleaned up and get the staff trained to at least a mediocre level.  Bottom line: I don`t know how this place stays opened and I don`t understand how this company can allow this to continue.

We thoroughly enjoyed our time here, and it was handily located on the first floor of the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth Hotel in downtown Montreal. While they had many selections of foods and notions you could purchase, the real hit was the countless hot and cold food offerings you could put together for a meal. The meal could be brought back to your room or eaten right there at numerous tables in the store.   This was a delightful change from the usual room service - which is still available in the hotel - to be able to curate you own meal.

It`s a great place for furnishing a home or apartment on a budget, or killing several hours on a rainy or extremely hot day. Since Charleston doesn`t have an IKEA, we visited on a weekend trip to Charlotte.  When you walk in, take the escalator upstairs to shop. The store is laid out by room/area, so you get lots of ideas for decorating and how to use your purchases- it`s a smart way to sell! Open the drawers, doors, and closets, and you`ll see organization options and how to maximize space. You can pick up your small items, but don`t free if you miss one- chances are you`ll have a chance to grab it later. For large items, I suggest taking a picture of the tag with your phone. I also suggest taking a picture of the store`s map with your phone so you know where the shortcuts are and where you are. Regular shoppers can download an app, but as someone who visited for the first time and will probably visit maybe once a year, it was a bit tough to locate maps.   The second floor is basically a maze and by the end of it, we were tired and hungry, so we sped through the kids area and had lunch in the upstairs restaurant. The food isn`t gourmet, but where else can two people eat for under $20 and split a delicious slice of almond cake for dessert? The salmon meal for $6.99 was a bargain and hit the spot.   After lunch, we headed downstairs to the a warehouse where you`ll look up items on the kiosk and grab your large purchases. Many smaller items are on this floor too, with some at the registers. Once you check out, there`s a small grocery where you can purchase candy and food items, including most items sold in IKEA`s restaurant (frozen meatballs, desserts, etc). A food stand also sells ice cream, cinnamon rolls, hot dogs, and other snacky items. Personally, I had to grab a bag at the $7.99/lb candy bin for a sugar high for the ride home.  My husband and I spent close to three hours at IKEA and took over 4,000 steps, so wear good shoes, drive a truck/SUV, and don`t come in a hurry. If you have questions, just ask a staff member- wearing a hideous but effective striped shirt, so you`ll know who they are.<6<5<2019<1<16<25

Went there to eat and it happened to be the night that Wu Tang Clan was playing, so it was super loud (the restaurant is a little area by the bar that is also very close to the concert venue and bowling). Noise is a problem if you are looking to eat there and have any sort of conversation with your dinner mates.  Food was good. Big portions, even on the appetizers. Solid menu. Fried chicken was a little overly salted and I think the reviews on here overrate the food for what you can get at other places on the LV Strip. However, the mac and cheese was the shiz. You can add stuff to it for $3 and IMO it was worth it to add the artichoke hearts and olives, although they were a little heavy-handed with the olives in that and my husband`s veggie sandwich.  The reason I gave it 3 and not 4 or 5. The service was SLOOOOOOW. Like, annoyingly slow. The restaurant area was not THAT busy for a Friday night at 8:30pm and we still waiting for our food for over 30 minutes, maybe more. The waitress was friendly but pretty aloof and didn`t once stop over to let us know the food was on its way.

Over the last year there have been multiple water leaks in the living room, bathroom and garage. The air conditioner pan is constantly (every few months) causing it to rain inside the apartment. The management knows this happens and instead of being proactive and draining the pan every 1-2 months they just allow it to overflow and ruin your stuff. In the last year the water leak has ruined my dining room table and chairs, decor on the table, laptop which was also on table, and over $500 worth of makeup. The most recent water leak in the garage ruined yearbooks and family photos, things that are not replaceable. According to management they are not responsible for any water damage even though it happens over and over again. If you value your possessions pick a different complex. They also have a terrible mail system with your mail box being a different number from your apartment number which results in a large amount of returned mail. Lastly they are not responsible for any packages that are lost after they have been delivered to the office. Even when there are time stamps proving they were delivered, as well as their admittance that they were delivered.<9<8<2017<6<4<22

After nearly 5 hellish years with Mozart, this week I received a notice from them stating that they weren`t renewing my lease.  When I called the only incident they pointed to as an explanation was because I warned my neighbors of the peeping Tom that was masturbating outside of our windows on the fire escape. There are numerous young college aged females that live in the building and Mozart refused to install motion lighting of any kind. After the 3rd incident I contacted an attorney, warned every tenant with a notice and threatened to contact the media if they didn`t do anything about it. They still refuse to install motion detected lighting, there are just very dim fluorescent lights out there now instead.  Mozart then began updating my apartment on the guise that they were bettering it for me, when in actuality they were doing it so they could show it to others. They put in new floors and a new cabinet -- I even had to stay in a hotel (at my own expense) because of the dust, dirt and lack of a floor in my bathroom! I posted a picture showing my bathroom one day when I needed to '"go.'"  Today, I posted an art mosaic that I was sure to point out when they were showing my apartment. The mosaic, posted inside my apartment, provides ample warning that this apartment came with '"strings attached'" -- a sexual deviant.  I posted a photo of the art mosaic on my facebook page too, for you to see as well: http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=42421164&l=67fe64e8eb&id=14209556  It says:    FUTURE TENANT (S):   THIS APARTMENT COMES WITH A PEEPING TOM.

Came on a weekday when it opened for lunch and got a couple corner pieces. $5 for 2 deep pizza slices and a soda is a good deal. There was also a calzone on special. The pizza didn`t live up to the hype for me and I was really disappointed with the restaurant itself. They are a carry-out type place and don`t have a public restroom. If I lived in the area I would come back for take out but wouldn`t go out of my way again. The crust was crispy like Pizza Hut pan pizza and the inside was almost doughy. So if you live in the area and know what you`re getting it`s worth a try.<27<9<2019<0<44<21

vZ4wF8XxftxaSkzfmWAT1g<Es9ldEGui_e2MprdcNbt_Q<b5OTjiOjEg_UkmObTVnf2A<2<0<0<0<"Came here for a quick lunch - my first time in one of these Schlotzky`s restaurants. The location is right off a main road, easy access, and ample enough parking. It was rather quiet, and only a few people were already seated and eating. The location is clean, well lit and lots of tables - I imagine it gets busy at regular hours. There was a counter for ordering (then they ran the meal to you when ready) and I also noticed aside from a self-serve beverage bar, they had a nice selection of other beverages available in a display case at the counter. AND - I`m not sure if this is a sinful pairing, but they offered CINNABONs for dessert!  I almost skipped lunch for one of those hot cinnamon buns, but I resisted. The menu includes sandwiches, pizzas (!), salads and soups and kids meals as well. After some perusing, I settled on a soup (broccoli cheddar), and the Veggie Avocado Smokecheesy (as described on their website: '"It`s not just cheesy. It`s the ultimate cheesy. Smoked cheddar with provolone, Swiss, grated Parmesan, red onion, tomato, spring mix, avocado, garlic dressing and Italian dressing. Served on our toasted house-made sourdough bun.'"). The young lady who helped me at the counter, Alisa, was very patient with me and efficient - props to her! I waited about 5 minutes and the meal showed up, and looked nice. The soup was hot and included a couple of small pieces of garlic bread. Very nice. The soup itself was tasty, thick with lots of tender chunks of broccoli. Very similar in taste and texture to other chain sandwich restaurants, but I did like it. The sandwich, however, was a disappointment. It arrived with a LOT of lettuce, and a good amount of tomato and avocado. The cheese seemed absent, though - if you compare the '"website'" version and the pic I took, it is hard to see the cheese - let alone FOUR cheeses (smoked cheddar, provolone, Swiss and grated Parmesan). And, to add insult to injury, I couldn`t taste or see any garlic and/or Italian dressing! The sandwich was basically a vegetable salad on a bun (which itself was tasty) but whatever little cheese they used was grilled into the bottom bun and certainly not enough (I know you can stack meat better than cheese for a sandwich, but come on people, make an effort here!). I did taste a smoked flavor in a couple of bites, but even after removing half the '"salad'" I still couldn`t say I had eaten a cheese sandwich - let alone a Smokecheesy, that is touted as '"not just cheesy . . . It`s the ultimate cheesy.'" Or not. Overall, I wouldn`t seek out Schlotzsky`s again for lunch - well, maybe just for a Cinnabon!"<9<11<2019<5<9<5

The entrees and quantity served has changed some. My son gets the grilled ham & cheese on wheat all the time. He has forever. He said this week he was not going there for a while mostly due to a change to the sandwich. He said it now comes on regular sandwich sized bread instead of the larger bread slices it had been for years. He also said they changed the fries from a long standing kind he likes to something else he did not like. I met some friends there a couple weeks ago. I ordered the Gary`s entree with Sausage links and home fries. I have ordered it for years and have become accustomed to it being served a certain way. When the order arrived there was literally (I counted them) 9 pieces of very well done home fries on my plate. Barbara thankfully saw it and fixed the problem with some nice fresh home fries but it should have never been plated in the kitchen that way.  We will give it some time and try again but if things go down hill like some restaurant take overs do it will be our last visit.<11<11<2019<1<54<39

Pleasant, up front, Nick, pitches the '"sale'" at exorbitant prices:  '"know what we are doing, here`s our plan for YOUR yard, blah, blah, blah.'"   The mentality seems to be we charge more but we are worth it...NOT!!!  Unfortunately there is a major disconnect between the sales pitch and the execution.  The pitcher was no where near our home on trimming day.  The crew of three men butchered the heck out of two previously, well maintained and trimmed, stunningly, beautiful mesquite trees.  The yard, bushes, concrete driveway and walkway were trashed: scratches/stains from dragging mesquites and sap.  Twigs and branches were embedded in remaining bushes and scattered over the front and back yard.  Several bushes were smashed and broken and need to be replaced and debris was left scattered over our yards.   In both trees, there are cut limbs that they left hanging and they are now dead; due to the height, removal by us is impossible.  It`s also now necessary to purchase a load of pebbles to replenish what was removed from the front yard along with the tree limbs and branches.  Nick took his time returning to our home after we summoned him to survey the damage.  A shrug and a couple hundred deducted seems to be the MO. Caution is advised!!!"<22<9<2018<15<54<21

Although the next reason might sound unimportant, the dumpsters they send out are in really good shape! I`m not sure how they keep that up.

First of all their best masseuse is a guy named Jason. (The English version of his name.)   The second best masseuse is Suzette. Now both of them can apply more pressure when doing massage, but if you`re just looking for soft comfort then anyone will work for you.  I get the hour foot massage for $30. That also includes 15 minutes of time on your neck and back and shoulder area. You can`t beat that price. and I think they`re open pretty late, there`s nothing better than gettin a massage then going home and going to bed.  If you`re looking for value, and nice people, this is your place.   *And right next-door you can get some alterations done, grab some Kimbop from the Asiana Market, or grab a meal at the Korean restaurant there. Their bulgogi and japchae are spot on. (Update: the Asiana market has now expanded and it`s across the street.)

There was an avocado garnish and some cheese. It wasn`t bad, just blah. If we go back we will order off the regular menu - if. Prices are good.<25<11<2019<16<0<22

Their sushi is for sure low quality sushi and their portions for the all you can eat is outrageous, the salmon sashimi was thinner than 1cm, it was just stupid. The cucumber we had were dry and was lacking water, the tempura was soggy and wasn`t crispy at all... the green tea ice cream i had, had other things mixed in with it?? like a sesame and i think there was a drop of soy sauce.   Their quality of food wasn`t the only bad thing about their restaurant, but their customer service was horrible too. We had 9 people and only 8 of us were eating and that is what we told the waitresses. However, one of the waitresses kept asking us '"how many people are eating'" and ofc we kept answering, but got confused when she was repeatedly questioning us. As she was asking she was making faces and giving us multiple eye rolls. When she finally understood she gave us a table and literally stomped away. As we eating, all of the workers were giving us dirty looks and talking about  us. However, it was not only us they were talking about, since I understood what they were saying they were talking about other customers.  I would HIGHLY NOT recommend this restaurant as it has low quality sushi and super bad customer services. All of the waitresses were rude one way or another. You could walk a few mins and go to subway, st. louis and etc."<15<7<2019<0<18<23

BYr8h5Xf9C01R70tpIqcPQ<NTO4NH-vlY9ZQ6roecBXyg<RlAZRnAWyHKdMJRFir9XzA<1<3<0<0<I never leave reviews and I made an account just so I could let others know my experience here. I was optimistic about the 1st appointment I`d had with Erin. I told her I hadn`t sought counseling in a decade because my last experience had been so terrible. She guaranteed it would be different here. I couldn`t get another appointment for 2 weeks and I wasn`t loving that as I told her my issues were building up each day but I thought it would still help. I had the 2nd appointment and it was fine but nothing spectacular, as in she listened to what I had to say but didn`t really say anything back. When leaving I tried to set my next appointment and they had nothing available for at least 3 weeks so they said they would have Erin call me to discuss options. No call came. After 5 days I called back and was told she`d call me again. Still nothing. 3 days later I called and asked to speak directly to her and was able to. She said my best option would be to keep taking the appointments available every 3 weeks or to see an intern who may have more availability. I called to set an appointment for that and was told I`d get a call back. Again, no call came. After a week I called and asked again, they said they`d get back to me. That was 3 weeks ago and I don`t anticipate hearing back from them at all. As someone that really struggled with reaching out for help after my previous experience I`m so disappointed with what I received here. I would not recommend anyone even try this place, find somewhere that actually cares if you`re receiving the help you need!<9<12<2018<16<57<41

Their parking is horrible because they only have 10-12 spots for the entire place. I saw some People park on the street, but it is such an inconvenient location for such a popular breakfast place.   As we all know it is a franchise place from Colorado, and when it first opened it required 40-50minwait. They use local ingredients to cook the very best quality of food possible. Very friendly , casual/ ambient atmosphere. Somewhat hipster like. Easy going yet energetic vibe. You have the option of sitting inside or sitting out side on their patio. I highly recommend sitting indoors since you`ll be facing bunch of ppl waiting or Parkin lot while eating.  Food took so long to come out. 20min of wait to be seated and another 20min to get our food seemed too long. Waiters and waitresses were really nice though making this wait tolerable.   Their business hrs are really short, They open early in the morning and closes at 2-2:30. so if you are aiming for breakfast menu, be there earlier.   They have so many different choices, but they are well known for their pancake choices. It was my third time going, and everytime I go, they had new pancake of the day. we ordered my all time favorite corned beef hash and pancake of the day.   Foods are amazing and very flavorful. 1. Corn beef hash- 5/5: comes with choice of eggs and toast. Hash is well cooked, super crispy and corn beef is amazing with the hash 2. Pancake of the day ; pizza pancake 4 /5: my first savory pancake. Very creative and  delicious  3. Orange mimosa 4/5: just ordinary good old mimosa Portions are medium to large size, 2 plates are definitely sharable between three ppl<19<5<2017<18<40<31

Sub tofu scramble for egg, choose soyrizo and ask to omit butter. Make sure to mention you want to vegan-ize, the waitstaff are knowledgable and will make sure it`s right!

rZ51AVIy8mY6rZGWadzxYg<mPR3ZOOpZ1mxIQHr1QeGZg<hdIlFOqPuvdJhZbA1PXXwg<4<3<0<0<"This review is overdue as I`ve been a customer of Collins since 2005.  I was first acquainted with the firm while working in Tucson on a temporary assignment.  Upon returning to my home in Chandler (Ocotillo) one weekend, I discovered that my AC unit had stopped working.  Pressed for time, I found Collins open on a Saturday.  As this was August, and I was pressed for time, I was impressed that these guys were able to come out on a Saturday night.  My unit was the victim of a poorly-installed coil when the house was built, necessitating a new coil and tubing.  They came out the following Friday (as stated, I was working in Tucson) and had the unit repaired in an afternoon.  Although the repair was expensive, after checking with other companies, I found that the prices (parts and labor) were in line.  Since then, Collins has had all my AC and heating business.  They installed a new AC unit three years ago at a reasonable price, and come out every year for a checkup and cleaning.  They don`t try to '"upsell'" you on a larger unit than you need, and made sure to keep up with the unit while under warranty in case something needed to be fixed while the unit was still covered.  Friendly, efficient staff and reasonable prices.  We all know that in Phoenix there are a lot of '"shady'" AC companies--but Collins isn`t one of them.  I`ve recommended them to friends and they will have my business as long as I live here.  Good outfit."<19<7<2012<17<49<28

The appt lasted 15 minutes, where the tech started to work on the AC and then tripped the power to my entire house. He told me I needed an electrician because I had a bad breaker and abruptly left. I was then without power to my entire house and no AC for another 24 hours - in the heat of July where the temp was 108 degrees. The electrician came the next morning and fixed the problem in 5 minutes, saying the tech tripped the power. There was no bad breaker, the tech caused the power outage. When another AC company (thankfully a different one because I called my home warranty company) came later on the day, I was informed that the tech from tecleft wires exposed and a completely unfinished  job on replacing the disconnect.

The driving instructors are unprofessional and does not provide you with enough practice on the road to successfully pass the driving exam. I had to change instructors three times because of what unorganized they are. They would often try to pull cheap tricks to waste time. Eg. Talking on their phone, texting, or stopping by at a location to do something else.    They would also make you drive to the next student`s home and pick them up and have them drive you back home. One of the instructors tried to shorten my driving sessions by 10 minutes. RIDICULOUS.   Going to this driving school is putting money down the drain.

I was not over full and just satiated. The eggs were done just right and the maple sausage was super flavourful and definitely tasted of maple.   Will definitely be back!

Wally and I spoke at length about his process - he makes the suits himself and can really do anything you`d like (which is rare at his price point). I prefer conservative navy`s and grey`s, so we picked out a great fabric for the first suit. The process took 3 weeks from when Wally took my measurements to the first fitting. After this, the suit was ready in another week. The service, product, and price are top notch, and I`ve already commissioned two more suits from Wally!<2<4<2019<22<53<14

And still had chicken sandwiches coming out to other tables after they said they messed mine up. Others walking out. No manager to apologize. Lack of urgency as others were getting the exact sandwich I ordered when they came in 25 minutes after us.   French fries brought out while we waited. They were over cooked. Loud and noisy cars.<6<12<2019<20<54<57

The manager came by to check on us while there, which is always a plus. We didn`t have a reservation and were seated quickly. This was on a weekend, after going to another sushi restaurant with an hour-plus wait and deciding to try Sen after it was suggested to us numerous times. My mother is Japanese, born and raised in Japan, and she enjoyed this place more than any of the other sushi restaurants I`ve taken her to on the west side. It`s a little dark inside but creates a nice intimate environment. Parking is plentiful, as well, which is always a good thing IMO.<14<1<2016<5<4<54

We were made comfortable and taken back to see the attorney I was assigned (can`t remember her name) wasn`t Mr Naqvi. The reason for only 2 stars is because their tv ad says they help by'" getting their clients to the best Drs'" when I went in and explained I was having a hard time getting an appointment with any dr because it was a motor vehicle accident and many would not see me. The attorneys response was '"oh we don`t do that'" when I asked her if they had a list of physicians they deal with she left the room, came back, and told me to call the number on my insurance card.  That was it. The consultation was short and sweet.  Now I see why it`s free.  I would have rather paid for a consultation and gotten some help vs free and no help at all. I guess if your case is worth millions they`ll take it but for us that weren`t  Missing a limb or killed we`re left to figure it out on our own."<12<10<2018<12<20<59

She seemed to have forgot that she made an appointment with us and proceeded to give us the most lack luster tour of all time.

With the Peking duck, you get the white bao bun to wrap the meat in.  I personally prefer the juicier roasted duck.  My dinner party had two full round tables we ordered several dishes: walnut shrimp, peking duck, roasted duck, lobster with noodles, winter melon soup, cold chicken, spicy green beans, spicy tofu, etc.  On the walls of the restaurant they have several awards claiming they are a top 10 Chinese restaurant in the US.  Overall the food is well prepared and delicious!  It is tough to say it is a top 10 Chinese restaurant because there are several in Los Angeles and San Francisco.  The restaurant could use some updating and the service could use some improvements.  Don`t expect 5 star service, but you will find delicious chinese food!  Cheers!<11<12<2019<4<40<35

2HPbelnchMvkNl5nsc6nLQ<b-iX6YclBmMKo9sEILdlaw<yRwrRVUQsCO3mp1dV9pPeQ<1<2<0<0<Wow, what an experience with this guy. I had a house fire and was exploring all my options all though being confronted by many adjusters, I did my research I came across him, and was my primary choice at who i wanted to hire after doing a lot of research into this company. Me as a business owner of many companies, i dont have time to interview many different adjusters, and he seemed like this would be the choice. So I called set up an appointment to meet with him, he showed up on time and heres where it went way south. From the very beginning this guy was asking me questions and I was answering them multiple times, he kept rambling the whole time, where i had to keep repeating myself, he just wouldnt listen to me the customer. Several times i had to repeat myself. I swallowed it because again I dont have time to interview many people. Then we started talking about my contents, and i said all my clothes which was a lot to me and he went into belittling me about how oh this is not a lot of clothes blah blah, guess what dude it is to me. He needed to go into so much detail where it just overally annoying. Again I swallowed that and we moved on. We are outside now and we are talking fees etc and even through the first wave of things my intention is these are the guys im going to hire anyways just to get the ball rolling. I simply asked this guy to send me over his contract so I can review it and make my final decision. (Most people want to see a contract before you hire them) he stated that he would not send the contract without me sending him my insurance declarations page. Which I had no problem to do I was already planning on sending to him I just hadnt got to it yet. And I told him I would but that he should still send over his contract while im waiting on my insurance agent to send me over what he needed. He was so adamant not to send me his contract until he had the declarations page. I asked him dont you have a standard agreement? He replied yes. I asked him whats the big deal just send it over so I can review it. Then here is where it gets more interesting, He goes into I dont send contracts because my time is blah blah, and that ive been scammed so much by people that waste my time and just use me. So now hes basically saying to me that im a scammer, and that my intentions are to waste his time when all im trying to do is proceed at making my decision to hire him. Immediately insulated after all his b/s talking about himself that hes from philly and hes a fighter and hes the best and hes blah blah blah so full of himself he forgets that none of that matters and overselling himself way to much. Big Ego. Im at the point now dude this guy just sold himself out of a job. Shut up tell me what you do what your going to do for me, what your fees are and heres a contract of whats expected would of gotten you 10x further then your big mouth. Hes so overally scared about having his time wasted that now hes wasting his own time selling himself out of jobs. Do you buy a car without seeing a contract? do you hire a contractor without seeing a scope of work, do you buy a house or anything in the matter without seeing what your getting into? How about a lawyer? Come on dude. I hope you realize where you messed up i get it i run business, and I hate wasting my time. Yesterday you not only wasted my time, but your own. and i was 95% sure to hire you (Even through all your talk I just wanted to get my claim finished) all i needed was to review the contract. A Bit of advice for you: Less talking about yourself, more listening to your potential client. Quit being scared that someone is wasting your time it business it happens, you win some you lose some, but from what representation I saw out of you your likely losing a lot of deals and thats why you have become so frustrated. Listening, sympathizing with your clients goes a longer way then selling yourself. If people are wasting your time your sales technique is likely why.   At this moment I do not recommend this guy for anyones home.  If Im the boss as you say, listen to your boss.<10<2<2019<20<41<41

I was promptly corrected by Tina that the nurse does not have the right to do that and only a doctor can, as I was telling her what I was told, she cut me off and asked for my name. I told her... and as I was asking something else she put me on hold. Totally disregarded my question... She told me the doctor would call when she had a chance and that they were open till 7pm and hung up!!! '"Hey Tina, I know my tests are not of any importance to you. You have made it evident that you have better things to do with your time than to do your job!! Even with how rude and inconsiderate you are.

As a long experienced medical professional, Dee first assesses your needs and where the technology will best impact your particular results.....she never up sells, she is always more interested in what is best for your case rather than the '" add on'" mentality of so many cosmetic improvement practices.  And because of her long experience, Dee is well educated in what to look for in your medical history that could create any negative interactions with this technology . Dee takes her time and makes you feel comfortable with indepth explanation every step of the way before she moves further. Bottom line this non invasive treatment works for spot reduction.....

I would have taken a photo of my order, but after one bite, I could not stop.  Not to sound pretentious, but each selection of food you choose -- whether for a sandwich (pita wrap) or salad -- has awesome flavor profiles. I don`t 100% know what that means because I heard it from the Food Network one time, but seems applicable. Whether it`s the cauliflower, eggplant (must try!), carrots and more...they all are seasoned perfectly and stand on their own.

Also, was asked if I could be put on a brief hold while my technician was asked about something that they hadn`t performed prior to calling me with `recommendations`.

Update: so I go back and follow their instructions and purchase the specific products and use them as directed and my hair is still not straight. This Keratin does not work.<30<9<2018<15<14<20

The crust has to be made fresh from scratch every day because the texture was perfectly crusty on the outside and delicious! The variety of pizza and the quality of the toppings are outstanding.  We didn`t have reservations and there was a bit of a wait, however, there were several open tables in the bar area that were available right away.  The service in the bar area was amazing. Our server was knowledgeable about their wines and spirits and offered great drink and food suggestions not to mention he spoke beautiful Italian.  The small pizza is huge and the added bonus of being able to split the pizza into two different flavors gives you a great opportunity to try different pizzas from the menu.  On top of the wonderful experience we were already having, there was also a live jazz band playing which filled the restaurant with wonderful music.  This place is definitely worth visiting and is probably my new favorite pizza place in Las Vegas!<3<3<2019<18<12<6

There is a parking garage for it accessible off Washington Street. Make sure you take your ticket to get parking validated otherwise it is 25 dollars an hour or I think they said maximum of 50 dollars for the day. You take the glass elevator down to the store and you walk right into the store from it. The store is very nicely organized and includes a wine bar with televisions, a fast food type of restaurant called Chompies that offers breakfast and lunch/dinner options as well as a nice seating area to enjoy your food. Aisles are well stocked. Attractive displays. Make sure you get the code if you need to use the bathroom. The store and merchandise and displays get a 5 star rating. Customer service gives it the 3 I rated. Our cashier did not greet us in any way and talked to a fellow employee most of the time he was ringing up our order. He only engaged with us when hubby asked how his day was going. Lots of other workers around throughout the store. Only 2 made contact with us. One an older man did smile and say hi. Another man did ask us how we were doing. We will be back if in the area and need something. They need to work on customer service. Oh they have a great salad bar!<18<11<2019<3<30<2

Day 1: Dropped off 3 prescriptions for my husband, went in 3 hours later and they only filled 1 (claimed they must have missed the other 2 due to computer problems).

Went in 5 hours later, given wrong dose and quantity of medication (did not realize until I was already home). Had to return to pharmacy again, wait 30 more minutes, and have my card charged again (they claimed they could not exchange the wrong prescription and I would have to wait 7 days for a refund).

We have a large party so the host said we DO NOT HAVE TO STAY IN LINE just give our phone number and they will send us a text notification when our table is set. Once received the text notification we headed over at the restaurant but only to find out that the host gave away our table. We waited for an hour and a half, and She [insert this dumb b*tch pictured]  didn`t even prioritize us which is what bothered my family and I. When asked what her name was, the '"no name host'" was ignoring the question but eventually said '"I`m not giving you my name.'" Already rude behavior. She still didn`t give the name but ended up getting her Manager instead. The supervisor was trying to accommodate us better than she was however, this rude host kept on meddling and trying to justify what she did was alright. Obviously we weren`t happy customers. To top it off, While my mom was trying to explain why we believe giving our table away was ridiculous, the no name host made some kind of side expression in front of us. Strike two with this host. This was unacceptable! This restaurant is highly reputable and   They allow their staff to be rude to customers?! We ended up leaving but jokes on this host.

The staff is so friendly and upbeat (shoutout to our awesome server Jasmine!). I ordered the Bene Duo (Chilaquiles and Chile Verde), my sister ordered the Lower East Sider, and we ordered the OMG French Toast to share. All of the items were superb!!! (But man, that French toast has to be the best I`ve ever tried.) I asked for hot sauce with my Bene Duo, and they gave me a local pineapple & habanero one to try, and I am in love!! Everything about Snooze was great, but IF I had to be critical about something, it would just be the color clashing theme of the restaurant haha but then again, it`s a breakfast/brunch place, so what do you expect. They comp`d our entire tab because they were raising funds for a group called Urban Harvest. Of course, we left the correct amount anyway, but how selfless can a restaurant be to basically be serving people free food (even Jasmine was just volunteering and didn`t accept our tip!) If you read into their mission and philosophy, it`s all about compassion for people and the planet. Such an inspiring place to eat at.<19<7<2016<17<52<48

It`s best to park on a side street, as the lot fills quite quickly. As mentioned in other reviews, the wait can be daunting. It is absolutely worth it. Pro-tip - go during the middle of the week before lunch, and you`ll be seated in less than 30 mins. Enjoy the complimentary coffee while you wait!   Once you get to the drooling-over-menu-in-your-booth stage, remember this simple fact: you cannot go wrong. Can`t choose between all the phenomenal eggs benedict options? They have a Choose 2 Option. Can`t pick pancakes or french toast? Substitute the french toast in for one of your pancake flight selections. You can literally add anything to your meal.  The bacon a la carte does not disappoint. The cinnamon roll pancakes are decadent (although beware the walnuts if you can`t stand nuts in your desserts like me!). Don`t be afraid to try out the pancake of the day, young grasshopper; you`re ready. The barbacoa eggs benny will make you feel sunshine. Mimosas are solid, but is that surprising? And expect your total bill to be between $10-$15 - no complaints there!   This place boasts their commitment to your best, most customized breakfast experience ever, and after a few visits, I can honestly say I believe them. In short, don`t sleep on Snooze, y`all. #staywoke<27<8<2017<16<39<46

This spot has been recommended by a few friends as everything is made fresh and it is not too pricey. I am glad that we got in the line when we did because there were at least 10 people behind us as we lined up. They definitely needed more people working during this time as the line did not stop. The people working were really nice and seemed to appreciate us being there.  It was a constant flow of people coming in and I see why as the food was delicious and fresh. It definitely could`ve been fresher as parts of the rice were burnt, the pork had a coat of grease on it. It all came together in the end with getting a lightly grilled chicken bowl that got cheese melted on it and then was topped with salsa and lettuce. The bowl was basic, but was light and good. It was big enough to fill me up and leave enough for lunch tomorrow or possibly breakfast?<26<11<2019<6<21<19

ugkRU74PXDGmRPBuDirovw<Mt-_SvJyDirR9fpZx9dbEw<d3qVYJJ59x1k_oYxiW9TSQ<2<9<3<4<"Against my better judgment, I`ve decided to give Arthur`s a chance to redeem itself after it had left a bad taste in my mouth in 2016 (you can read my previous review below). Sadly, my experience today was more of the same old, if not worse. In summary, the protracted wait time and discourteous service more than negated the quality of the food.  When we arrived today, we were informed of a 45-minute line-up. We decided to join the queue and gave our phone number to the staff member who told us we would be texted 5 minutes before our table is ready. Thus, we did not have to wait by the entrance like last time in 2016. I do commend Arthur`s for implementing this technology.  After being seated, nobody came to take our order. We decided to take matters into our own hands: I very politely caught the attention of a tall waitress with a tiny hair bun and courteously informed her that we were ready to order. Little did I know, that was apparently a major faux pas. With a forced and insincere smile, that waitress retorted '"I will be with you *WHEN I AM READY*!'" in an extremely passive-aggressive tone. We were both taken aback at her terse response and disingenuous '"courtesy'". That was very mean-spirited in my opinion. Keep in mind that we patiently waited 45 minutes to be seated, and waited another short while after being seated, and out of all the things she could have said, she decided to say those exact words! She came back around 10 minutes later to take our order, after finishing up other tasks that were subjectively more pressing to her.   When she snapped '"I will be with you *WHEN I AM READY*'" passive-aggressively, it rubbed both of us the wrong way. Her tone implied that we should not have bothered her because she was busy, and that we should have bitten our tongue until spoken to. To me, this is evidence that the clients at this establishment are being taken for granted by at least some of the waitstaff. It almost seems as she`s doing us a favor by even acknowledging us. She might as well have frowned and said something along the lines of '"Can`t you see that I`m busy? Just wait until I come to you, jeez...'" The message would have been the same, but at least less disingenuous.  Despite the terrible service, our food was good. The waitress never came back afterwards to check on us to make sure that everything was satisfactory. By the way, if you value privacy, this place is not for you because the restaurant is cramped with tables placed very closely together, with little elbow room.  My experience today convinced me not to return a third time. One of the reasons why I go out of my way to spend my hard-earned money at a restaurant is not solely for the food, but for the convenience, the service, and the ambiance. Although the food was good, it was not worth the cost, especially if you have to wait 45 minutes to be seated, just to be treated like a burden in a passive-aggressive tone. I was really hoping to update my review with a better rating, what a shame!"<19<1<2019<22<59<0

I purchased a groupon a bit ago and it has since expired, which I understand is my fault, not the business`. However, it never hurts to ask, so I called twice and got no answer, then left a message asking if they might still honor the groupon, and got no response after over a week. I sent an email explaining that my call was unreturned and asked my question again, which is when they responded with the rule: you can use your groupon, but '"you need to pay the difference,'" so it`s full price. Fine, fair enough, but the issue that they never returned my call was never apologized for. Based on other reviews, it`s uncommon for this business to return phone calls. As an office manager, that`s not something I can tolerate. Too bad the groupon isn`t refundable anymore.

It wasn`t too busy when we first got here.  We were greeted by the hostess and sat right down at a two seater.   We had looked over the menu a little bit before we came here so we sort of knew what we wanted.  Our waitress was nice and she came over to ask us if we had ever been here before and if we would like her to explain the menu.  We let her and she did a good job explaining everything to us.   We ordered their Meat Bao bun that had Oyster in it to start us off.  For our main dish I ordered the Shoyu Ramen and my wife got the Inferno Ramen.   Our Bao came out within 10 minutes.  It looked good. Our waitress said that if we were sharing it they would cut it in half for us but they didn`t but  no big deal we cut it and shared the bun.  The actually bun was good but we felt that it needed more filling.  It was a lot more bun and less Oyster.  It was good but we have tasted better.   Our Ramen came out about ten minutes later.  Our dishes looked really good and we were hungry.  My wife liked her dish and you can read her review on her Ramen.  My Ramen was good but not great.  The noodles were really good.  The broth warmed us up and was good but I felt it needed a little more salt or something to bring out more the flavors in my Ramen.  I`d give it a six out of ten.  I like the vegetable in my Ramen but the chicken looked a little funny to me and tasted funny too.  The Ramen filled me up and I was satisfied.  Not the best Ramen and maybe a little over priced but if your in the area and it`s cold out this is a good spot to try out.<8<1<2018<15<48<48

This company was recommended by Maytag as an authorized company. Yesterday, we had this company come to our house to fix a small leak that we had in the front/bottom of our washer. When the tech arrived (Steven) he didn`t walk me through or explain anything that he was doing. Prior to me having them come out I told them that it takes about 3 loads to see the leak but that it also happens when it hasn`t run in over a week. Steven then said '"So you want me to stand here for 3 loads? You should have run 3 loads before I got here. I don`t have time for that.'" He had only been there for 20 minutes. I replied '"No, but it would`ve been nice if someone told me I needed to do so.'" All he did was just surface level '"look'" at things but didn`t even dig for a problem. He typed in a bunch of codes on the machine ran it through a test cycle and said that he couldn`t recreate it so he was done. He did lift the machine up one time but briefly and because he didn`t see anything, sat it down and then said the 3 loads statement. I then got frustrated due to him not helping and he said in a nasty tone have a nice day and walked out of my house. Then I tried to run a small load of laundry and due to the codes that he typed in I`m now left with a machine that won`t stop running. So now my machine is worse off than before. I called the owner to complain about his attitude toward me and he called him to correct that, but then I had to call back about my now malfunctioning machine and he unfortunately had to re-connect me with the same tech to fix the issue...which he didn`t fix. The 2nd time we got back on the phone trying to get my machine to stop, he mentioned that he could come out next day (which doesn`t work b/c I moved my work schedule around to be there for yesterday) Then he said that I took my frustration out on him by calling his boss, which pissed me off and then I said maybe if you were more polite to your customers that wouldn`t happen and then he said that he wasn`t going to come back and fix what he broke.  Never had such terrible customer service in my life. If you don`t want a headache, then don`t hire this company!!!"<27<6<2019<14<58<57

They all but one have lived up to 13 years old. A labrador and a cat who is too heavy for her breed and they all handle our pets with care and love! So, as an adult now, I now just took my family`s (husband and kids) cat Raven here to get spayed and they chipped her, spayed her and gave her all her shots including a courtesy cat nail trimming all for $160! I had also been referred to buy a friend who had all the same things done as well to her cat. We just took our Raven back there today to remove her stitches and the staff is so helpful and answer every question I have. I think my cat actually doesn`t mind the receptionist lol<1<9<2018<7<43<11
F5rNpKCOUCdDY2U8ZW7Tpg<orabz5T-rhMibmGeTlbWDQ<kQ3GadfE4W9sJeWLMQPLew<1<6<0<0<Do not ever go to Las Vegas pain and medical center. I started out as a patient in the beginning of the year because of the new laws. I have Lupus, R/A, fibromyalgia, arthritis in 90% of my body and several herniated discs.  All they have done is rack up charges with 1 MRI visit for $7500, physical therapy, chiropratic sessions, massage therapy all at their facility. One doctor there named Starling or Sterling suggested an operation the month before last (the first time I saw her).  I have done pretty much everything they asked including agreeing to  be seen by a surgeon even though I was told to get surgery 20 yrs ago but decided against it after weighing the pros and cons but agreed to a second opinion becaus Dr. Starling who saw me once before  told me she was afraid I would become paralyzed and that scared me to death. She also said that I needed another MRI, even though they just did one a few months prior.   So today, I  saw that same doctor  Sterling or Starling, (whom I have seen only twice including today but not last month  because they rotate doctors) told me my injections were approved and I`m like what injections? I didn`t agree to injections!  She said if I didn`t get injections (which I`ve tried in the past and made my body flare horribly) they would drop me as a patient.    Every time I go in there I see a different doctor or their P.A and get different suggestions by each for different  treatments. I told her I was not open to injections because I have tried them and they didnt work, she told me well you cant put oil in a car just once. What?? What are you talking about?  She said she was going to dismiss me as a patient because I refuse to do their treatment plan and obviously I am only concerned about the pain meds.  My reply was excuse me? I have done pretty much everything you asked so far and I take one pain pill a day to be able to get out of bed and move and on really bad days up to 2 at the most.    Her associate who I have never met (I think her name was Stephanie) was also in the room and basically agreed with her. I was in shock! I despise drugs, take only what meds are necessary to survive and be able to get out of bed,  have never failed any drug test.    I asked, just so I understand you are not willing to help me unless I agree to injections and are basically telling me that I have no say over my body? I went on snd explained everytime I have invasive procedures my body has more issues than before.  I also stated that you`re treating me like a drug addict even though I only take one a day and I`ve done pretty much everything that you`ve asked me to do except for the injections because I flare up from them.    She was so rude and so nasty to me, Starling said to the other we need to dismiss her she is going to be drama.  What? Really? How? I told them I have never been treated like this and have had these health issues most of my life.   She then proceeded in listing  off all her qualifications even though I never questioned them. I told her that I have never had a problem with any of her associates or staff members prior to the issue I was having today.  She then left the room and the other lady who walked out a minute earlier came back in, I tried to talk to her reasonably and she started mocking me and said oh yeah she`s right your going to be drama.  Really? Because I don`t want injections that makes me drama?  Completely unprofessional behavior and language from women who are supposed to be so intelligent.   I got so upset I just told her I don`t want you treating me and I would be writing a review as I walked out. I am seriously wondering if she even had my file or if she ended up with someone else`s because I was in shock of how I was treated.   It`s horrible that people with documented health diseases and disabilities are treated like this. I take chemo therapy once a week and need my medications that I have been on for 20yrs. I think considering all my health issues I do pretty good at not increasing my medications, eating right and staying physically active as much as possible and also have good long relationships with many of my health care providers.  It is apparent that this facility and it`s doctors are no longer getting kick backs from big pharmaceutical companies anymore so they are trying to rack up patient medical bills through their facility with every treatment they can bill your insurance company for. They also slapped me with  $175.00 of fees all of the sudden today even though I pay my copays every visit...<9<10<2018<6<54<47

I was enjoying a dinner out with friends at the Buffalo Wild Wings across the parking lot of this Hawaiian place when a girl came in wearing her work shirt with '"Ono Hawaiian BBQ'" logo to also dine in. Apparently, she was unhappy with her wings and she let EVERYONE know. She began yelling and cursing at her server who asked her to stop using such profanity which seemed to make matters worse. She got louder and the profanities got even more disgusting and shameful. She even threw her box of wings across the dining room! Who actually goes into an establishment to harass and dehumanize a poor server over some wings? She was filming the server and herself, repeatedly using racist slurs as if she was waiting for him to do something. I am not sure as to what she was trying to accomplish, she only embarrassed herself and her place of employment, in my opinion. I have never and I will never give my money to an establishment that tolerates this kind of behavior from their employees. Ono Hawaiian BBQ, as well as that girl, should be ashamed and hopefully the proper actions have taken place."<6<12<2019<22<27<0

However, the employees judge customers by a look a lot. My BF went in to get a specific passport cover from a new collection and was wearing a casual jeans and t-shirt took and had the worse customer service ever. No one payed attention and ignored him on purpose, serving other customers who came in later first. After he finally got to talk to the employee, she was very rude just saying '"we don`t have that cover'" and didn`t provide any help (if she offered to order one, he would definitely do it). Just to mention, my BF had bought from this particular LV store at least one purse for me and bunch of accessories like scarves, passport covers and so on in the last year and even more from the LV stores in other cities. Such a shame to get a treatment like that when you`re a returning customer All the previous times we came in dressed nicely (I suppose that played key role)  and got plenty of attention from employees in this store who were willing to sell us stuff. After this situation we will deliberately avoid this particular LV store"<2<9<2019<17<48<13

First off, they have the greatest crispy pork belly in the city since the owners also have Asian BBQ & Noodles and the rest of their awesome hanging meats.  I also recommend their $48 Peking Duck, Lobster cooked in ginger and scallion with vermicelli underneath and any fresh catch.    Dim Sum has a lot more hits than misses, which is good enough.  I enjoyed all the dumplings, shrimp eggplant, shrimp balls and the Pan Seared Cheung Fun Noodle Rolls most of all!!  Try getting there before 11am or have friends nice enough to get there early ;0  On a side note, they play an awkwardly long happy birthday video on their big screen for whoever is celebrating, and it is the perfect mix of embarrassing and funny should you find the opportunity to request it.<4<11<2019<19<55<49

We waited over an hour to be seated although there was open unbussed tables. A friend and I finally stacked and cleared the dishes and wiped it down ourselves. Staff was nice but so lost and confused. Took another hour to get only half our food which was cold and missing most ingredients. Literally, philly cheese steak with cold meat and bread only. Cold fries, no salad, etc. We were all laughing about how ridiculous it all was but still very nice to the staff. Tables around us were complaining and sending back food. I`d guess 85% of the guest were unhappy. After the waitress couldn`t get the owner to fix our bill for half the food that never showed up, we finally got a chance to talk to owner ourselves. He was beyond rude and unapologetic. Although the ambiance was nice, it was hands down the worst restaurant we`d ever been to. I give it 2 months.<13<12<2019<0<52<37

But I am so happy that I got a chance to attend. Thank you Kayla, Yelp, and Bally`s for this experience. I laughed so hard the entire time, more than stand up shows!   Scott and Brendan were fantastic! They ran the entire show with so much energy, enthusiasm, and with a bit of improvisation. They had great chemistry and hats off to Brendan for running around with all the costume change. I got a chance to get on stage because none of the kids would go up. It was so much fun! I will definitely be back and bring my out of towner friends. This is great for all ages and even for non-Harry Potter fans. The venue was intimate, you`ll find a good view with any seat in the house.  Bally had paid parking and the box office is right in front, near the lobby.

This time its Affliated dermatology and wait a minute , did I say ignorant ? I thought Dr`s ere supposed to be smart ? People for those of you who think Dr`s are miracle workers and are just busting out all over with intelligence you better check yourself because they are people too. People that showed an extraordinary amount of drive and discipline at one time period of their life sufficient to obtain the educational degree of Doctor.They become proficient in their area of expertice  by '"practicing medicine'". Hypothetically speaking if there was a way for you to shadow a doctor who lets say did mason gastric bypasses. you attended these operation procedures regularly 1, 2 or 3 no matter how many a day until he the dr. felt you were competent and knowledgeable enough to join in eventually down the line sometime you would be able to perform the operation yourself. BTW a mason gastric bypass is mearly the reduction of the stomach capacity to hold food by stapling off a portion of it.                                                             So anyway their is nothing worse then being talked down to by someone who thinks they are better and smarter than you. Such was the case with the dr I had to see. We clashed right from the beginning because I really don`t stand for condescending people. The DR. who thought she was helping me was ignorant as a mfer. She wasso ignorant she thought Norweign scabies was a geological affliction, meaning she thought you had to go to Norway to contract it.

G7ZC_PBiIOqWbqBkDiBNLw<RMJMxxcSVcELe5itHx1OWA<GYD-zJZnqrMWR8u2ML06Vg<1<0<0<0<I experienced horrific treatment while dining at this restaurant this past Sunday.   I ordered a bag with mild sauce.  I asked the waitress for an extra sauce .  The sauce she provided was spicy, I did not realize the sauce was different until I poured it in my bag.  I took one bite and could not tolerate the spices.  I sent the contents back and asked to speck to a Manager.  The Manager (Laura or Lauren) came to the table with a terrible disposition.  She told me the kitchen advised the correct sauce was sent out.  She stated this 3x after i advised the sauce was indeed wrong! She said they would make it over.  Fine.  When the waitress returned with my bag the bag had the exact same contents i sent back.  I immediately asked for the manager.  I questioned the  back and asked how was it possible to have my exact contents from my old back in a new back with different sauce.  Did the kitchen rinse off my contents?? She had no answers.  She advised she has nothing to do with the kitchen and since she does not work back there she cant speak on what happened.  I asked for her to go get who could explain this to me.  She said I would need to speak with the kitchen manager.  Fine.  I waited and waited... next thing I know there are 5 police officers are in the lobby asking for me!  Yes she actually called the police because I questioned my order.  I explained the entire situation to the police and what do you know they were 100 percent on my side.  I believe she lied about the kitchen manager and called the police to save face.  I advised if the make my bag completely over I will pay for my meal.  It was never about not paying it was about fixing a mistake they made!  Of course at this point I did not eat the contents there is no telling what they may have done to my food.  However I paid for the meal and left.  I will never return to this restaurant.  Word of mouth is everything.   We had a party of 20, 20 individuals telling 3 individuals to avoid this restaurant is bad business.  Lauren or Laura does not deserve the title of Manager.  She was not apologetic nor did she show any empathy for the situation. She was down right rude with zero customer service.  I will be taking this to upper management as I wouldn`t want anyone else to experience this treatment.<26<11<2019<18<45<6

I would give the overall rating a 3.5 if I could do half stars.  I ordered the waffleque with brisket.  It was marketed as a sweet potato waffle with bourbon syrup and pecan butter, you get your choice of meat.  I chose brisket.  The waffle was meh.  I got no sweet potato flavor it in.  The syrup tasted like normal syrup, and the pecan butter was no where to be found.  The brisket was cold/room temp, but had a really good flavor.  Hence the slightly above meh rating.  My partner had the PBLT and I had a bite.  Better than mine, as the tomato compote did wonders for the dish, but still nothing to write home about.    I also ordered a side of breakfast potatoes.  They were $5 which I don`t mind paying, but when i received them, they were mostly flavorless, and there was not much of them.  If you are going to charge me more than a 10lb bag, I do expect them to be really flavorful, or have something special about them.  The server initially forgot to bring them out, so perhaps the kitchen forgot to prepare them, and that is why I got so little... i don`t know.    First impressions are tough to shake and my first impression is that Smoke Pitt might not be worth it compared to other offerings at Smallman Galley, however, all the other reviews give me pause to write them off just yet.<27<11<2019<14<27<32

The waitresses most times offer to cook and cut up the meat, so you can relax (and take a break from eating! Lolol) since they can control the heat. Fast strong heat and good ventilation. Also very generous when we asked for seconds on some sides, sauces and garlic. A perfect place for large groups and families, many seats around as we came for dinner. I liked that they play soft piano covers and bmgs, which is suitable of their more casual sophisticated dining.   Saying again, great cuts of meat especially the pork belly (samgyupsal) was very fatty. The fresh beef ribs (saeng galbi) was delicious too. Good tea. We liked that our soybean stew had a nice spicy kick and some side dishes were nicely seasoned. I def think some side dishes could be improved or added.

I was very excited to see Snooze make it to our city after having a great experience in their downtown Denver location. The service is almost always friendly and helpful (we all have bad days, especially at a place that is always as packed as this) and on several occasions we`ve had the chance to try the pancake of the day, on the house. The rest of their menu has lived up to the same quality as well. Get your name on the list and check it out.<25<5<2018<0<19<20

Like this place is a godsend its sooooo good, and the '"Snoozers'" helps keep it lively, I forgot to ask their names but, im pretty sure that they will know who they are when they read this review, them made sure that i was comfortable and kinda homey i guess you can say, and the cooks did an A1 job, didn`t miss a beat with my order. Recommending this to everyone who are breakfast lovers."<26<7<2016<13<34<18
Rm2YuW9W5lfGMRxTWIjDIQ<eb8jAt31F_iox6abOAuBJA<utIA0LyQmwP-9DRyxUe6qQ<2<2<5<0<"Today I decided to try this place out. Since I read the reviews the 2 hr wait time I was quoted was not a surprise. I was in a '"party of 2'" and decided to  go to the bar to order a Bloody Mary and a pineapple mimosa, now I specifically said add bacon (an extra 1.25 but no biggie) and waited for the drinks. Mind you there was one seat at the bar and I proceeded to sit down and was told by MARIAH in a certain tone that it`s full service only. Now I might have thought I was trippin at first but her tone was very I won`t say rude, but it wasn`t in a nice way. I brushed it off and we got our drinks.   The Bloody Mary is decent, MARIAH forgot the bacon but whatever. I didn`t try the mimosa, so we continued to stand around and again in that '"tone'" MARIAH made sure to let us know that we were pretty much in the way. I guess it`s only order and pick up drinks which is cool, but again it was the tone that was irking my nerve. Like chill out, this is our first time here, the place is jam packed with people standing waiting for tables. Oh and another thing MARIAH carded me and the person I was with which was no problem, but remember that small piece of information as you keep reading.  So after waiting which seemed like 30ish min, the couple next to us seated at the bar said we can have their seats since they were done. Awesome! The wait time definitely was still like another hr or more. So as we are trying to sit down I can clearly see MARIAH have this look on her face like she didn`t want us to sit there. Even the person I was with was like '"what`s her problem, I`m not feeling her vibe'". MARIAH, again in that '"sh*tty tone'" told us to take our name of the wait list. Now at this point I was gonna hit her with '"no sh;t bish'" but I don`t even care because I`m hungry and can finally sit and look at a menu. So MARIAH proceeds to ask if we wanted another drink while handing out menus. I order a water and my friend orders another pineapple mimosa. Now I`m seated literally right next to the area where you order drinks at the bar. So people are coming up every now and then. We are still browsing the menu (again we`re 1st timers) when MARIAH asks if we`re ready, like don`t rush me, chill out. We finally order and wait for the food. Another 35min.  Now back to me being carded. So this chick (in a super cute Jean dress) stands next to me and orders drinks (alcoholic ones) from MARIAH, and she has her ID in her hand about to hand it over when MARIAH waves her off like it`s all good. Now I`m like HOL`up. Me and this girl clearly look around the same age but she doesn`t get carded.  so I`m talking about it to my friend. He was like maybe she`s a regular, but it was obvious she wasn`t from their interaction. Again, she`s standing RIGHT NEXT TO ME. So this other chick comes up who clearly looks 21 or younger and she gets carded and I bring it up like, that`s strange. So MARIAH over hears this and is like is there a problem? I said I`m just confused why there is selective carding. Then this chick proceeds to lie in my face and say '"oh I grabbed her ID and said it was good'" now in my head I`m like '"bish you really want to tell that bold face lie'" but I hit her '"um no I sat here and watch you wave her ID away without looking at it. Then this clown decides to get her manager involved which is fine with me.  So the manager comes over (shorter lady with reddish hair, very nice by the way) and says '"you`re trying to order a drink?'" My friend and I look at each other like what is she talking about. I said no I already ordered I don`t know if she couldn`t hear or what but then she proceeds to ask me for my ID. I`m looking at her like umm no. I tell her I already ordered a drink awhile ago. She says oh I was told you were trying to order a drink and there`s a carding issue. I proceed to tell her the real situation and she understood, we laugh about it and keep it moving.   Food finally comes and then MARIAH hands us silverware. My fork handle was VERY DIRTY, with food still stuck to it, I ask for another and she hands me another set of silverware. This one with LIPSTCK on the fork. I show it to MARIAH, she apologizes then grabs another and looks over it before handing it to me this time, all good.  I ordered the pancake trio and 3 eggs meal. The standouts were the hash browns and the pumpkin pancake. My friend had some kind of eggs benedict ranchero or something like that. It was really good.   In all, get there early. The food is really good. I was over MARIAH and her antics, so if/when I return I`ll make sure not to be serviced by her. Side note....Slim Thug ( yes the rapper) came in a few minutes before we were finished. He and his crew were waiting for tables by the door and guess who wanted to make sure all her coworkers were aware MARIAH. Oh and guess who wanted to make time to go up and speak to him, MARIAH. Here`s a tip, how about check the rest of the silverware you`re giving out instead of '"ke-ke-ing'" it up in some rappers face."<16<10<2016<23<33<18

My favorites are the pineapple upside down pancake, OMG French toast, blueberry streusel pancake. Every thing is delish. Omelettes are full of variety and come with a create your own option and fresh egg white is also available. They have tofu meat options for you meatless lovers.

It`s one of those issues that when you`re with the mechanics, it works just fine, making it very difficult to diagnose. Well, my service advisor John Cummins has been with me all the way. I`ve been provided a complimentary car (a new Mercedes with less than 2500 miles on it) to use as they trouble shoot and fix. When one attempt to fix didn`t solve the issue, they gave me a full credit. It`s now been resolved. The vehicle was out of warranty, and it did cost me something to fix it, but Schumacher really worked with me. It`s this level of service you expect from a top dealership representing Mercedes, I got it.<16<5<2012<3<33<23

It`s a great set up and I will be switching my health plan to become a member this month.  It truly is like going back in time several decades when doctor appointments were easy to make and it`s a good experience.  Here are the positives:  very few people in the waiting room so efficient time mgt on part of doc and staff, doc takes as much time as needed, we never feel rushed,  he is an excellent doctor who is thorough, knowledgeable and very kind to my 89 year old dad (he comes out to the waiting room to get my dad--seriously, what doc does that any more?), I can email Dr. Hoecker and he will answer  back,  it is easy to schedule appointments, great staff who are pleasant and helpful, easy parking and drop off, in the waiting room there is hot tea and water machine plus masks to wear to reduce exposure if necessary and it`s spotless- decorated very nicely.  Down side: once you experience this, you won`t be satisfied going back to the rude, crowded, medical offices where you can only see a nurse practitioner unless you are deathly ill.

Z7KAul_2Iq5qH6RzXy7raA<wvk5dv3Jyxrkf3yv3Rva7A<Zkn1y0l3eDjzIONKMNl-ew<2<0<0<0<Money Grab First off I would like to say that the environment was very pleasing and the DM we had did a fantastic job at entertaining us. The wait staff was excellent and the food was good, the dessert was out of a box IMO and not great. What gives this a poor two star rating was the way they charged for their meals. We did the DM & Dine which included a set menu of a your choice of an appetizer and main course , for our group that was $60/person, however if you chose to ordered off their regular menu you paid the full price for what you ordered plus the $60 DM & Dine charge (which included a meal), there was no additional charge added to your $60 charge to make up the difference or discount give for the food that was covered under the DM & Dine charge. For example I could have got a burger off the set menu but I chose to order the Dungeon Burger off the regular menu which cost $20 instead of charging me an additional say $5 for the Dungeon Burger on top of the covered meal charge, I was instead charge the full price of $20 so my final bill was say $80 as opposed to say $65, when I question why I was charge so much i was informed it was to difficult for them to adjust the billing. so I ordered an extra meal off the set menu ( at no extra charge) because i was paying for it wether i wanted to or not and it was going to cost me the same if i didn`t order it. Great experience right up until the end then very disappointed to the point that it made me not want to return to this establishment.<8<12<2019<1<15<43

Last night when my two daughters ordered $70.  worth of food using Door Dash food delivery service, they did not get their food.  They got an email stating that they were called over ten times and were text also.  They did not get any phone calls and their phone is a land line and does not get text messages.  They stated that their delivery was taking more than ten minutes and they had to get to their next delivery and left.  They would not get their money back. My daughter checked her cell phone and Door Dash App. and found that on her profile there was a wrong phone number that was supposed to be hers.  She called me because I had programed her information into her phone.  I again imputed the correct phone number.  To recheck to make sure the information was right, I found that there was another number that was not hers.  To be sure, I did the same thing at least ten times and each time after putting the right phone number in, a wrong number would appear.  There is something wrong with Door Dash`s programing system.  I don`t know if this an isolated case but I felt that I should notify as many people as I could to let them check their phones, This might be a systemic problem. My daughter deleted the app and will not use this service again.  I was curious about the company so I looked them up an there are many complaints about them.  So many that they are listed on Scam sites for various problems, from not paying their drivers to not delivering the food.  When I I called Applebee`s, and spoke to the managers, she was of no help.  She told me to have my daughters work it out with Door Dash.

I came in looking for suggestions on lip color, makeup and eyelashes having absolutely no knowledge of any of them. I was greeted upon arrival and the young lady that helped me was so warm and welcoming. When I told her what I was looking for, she helped me as best as she could but was honest and told me that the owner Nikki would be the one who could get me right. I was blow away by her customer service because for some reason customer service in most businesses seems to be a thing of the past.   Now let`s talk about Nikki; when I tell you that Nikki is the BUSINESS, I mean THE BUSINESS!! I explained to her that I was getting married and what I was looking for. She gave her disclaimer that that she wasn`t a make-up artist but she would do her best to help me out with what I was looking for. Not only did she show me her selection but she took the time, about 1 1/2 hours to be exact, to apply my make-up and eyelashes all while explaining what each product did!! Even with spending this time with me, she made sure to greet each and every customer who walked in her store. When I tell you the customer service, attention to detail and genuine care for the customer shines in this store - it shines and it shines BRIGHT! I live on the other side of town however, this will be my go to for all my beauty supply needs!<10<7<2018<19<52<56

When I checked in at the front desk, they informed me that they were running 10 to 15 minutes late.  I had no problem with them running a little behind.  However, 20 minutes later I went back to the front desk and the manager, Amanda, told me that it was going to be another 20 minutes.  I informed her that I had an appointment and she stated that '"your appointment is not really your appointment time.'"  I was livid and I finally left by noon (40 minutes past my appointment).    I have used The Picture People since my toddler was a baby.  I have never experienced poor customer service before.  I was shocked and very disappointment.  I will never use The Picture People again."<17<8<2016<18<4<8

Then she brought my food to me I took a couple of bits then I discovered hair in my mouth.  I told the waitress about the shake and the hair in my food. She apologize.  The manager never came to our table apologize about the experience.  When we checked out to pay the manager was clueless about what happened and still didn`t apologize about what had happened.  She should never be a manager in this place it use to be my favorite place. It`s gone downhill.  I always love the old fashioned glass and the tin you get with your shake. Corporate.

8FDrv8VbJVjAjTEQHojQzQ<zsJFjhBQEFQ6gJ7BsNM_Ug<AY4WY_rfrQum3Ad_ohNhVw<4<3<0<1<Purchased 6 samosas of different fillings with Tamarind dipping sauce for $6.50. Not sure if they charged me the price of half a dozen or individually.  They have various kinds, such as traditional beef, chicken paprika, mutton, curried vegetable, daal, steak & potato, tandoori chicken, 10 vegetable, spinach & cheese, and potatoe & cheese. The dipping sauces include coriander yogurt, tamarind and spicy mango. I love how it`s hot (temp) and crispy on the outside.  The samosas are all flavorful, and I love the variety of it.  However, one samosa for ~$1.10 is kinda pricey, considering you can get samosas in Little India that is bigger in size for $1 or even 5 for $2. The positive side is that they give a free dipping sauce.  I would definitely come back if I`m near the area.<17<12<2018<19<29<28

We started the evening with family style appetizers of prawns, mussels and egg rolls. The. We each had a choice of soup or salad and main entree. I chose the butter lettuce salad with shaved carrots and beets and almonds. It was a unique spin to have butter lettuce, but the almonds gave it the crunch I was looking for.   For my main entree I went classic shepherds pie. We were served a house Cabernet Sauvignon and it was smooth and delicious. The shepherds pie was hot and the meat and potatoes were great. I would have loved a little more crust on the top, but I am no expert.   For dessert we had chocolate chess pie and creme brûlée paired with coffee cocktails with peppermint and it was strong! The desserts were sweet and hit the spot.   But the real stunner was owner Murph. He shared from the heart about his restaurant, with his Irish accent and all. He talked about his desire for his team to serve the community on our best days and our worst and one example of that. The chef shared about the local as you can get seafood, and '"southern spin'" on the food and Greg the alcohol pro shared about house made syrups and the Importance of a balanced cocktail. One other note I appreciated was for the wine selection, Murph asked his vendors to find out what similar communities like, so that it wasn`t he himself creating the wine list, but something that would speak to his audience.   The decor is simple, but the tvs in the main seating area feature Irish photos rather than sports, so I liked that touch.   Really enjoyed the table conversation too.

There`s no seating here, so it`s delivery or carry out only. No worries! You will be treated to delicious pie!   My wife is a finicky pizza eater. She never likes the sauce or the crust. They`re always too plain and too thick. She RAVED about the sauce!! I may have created a monster here. Stella`s sauce is stellar!! So rich, flavorful and bold. Not too much. Just enough.   The crust is like a thin hand tossed. Not a thin. It`s really perfect. We got the Mariachi and added meatballs since they didn`t have ground beef. The meatballs were surprisingly delicious. I don`t normally love them, but the gal at the register told us they were not weird and really good. She was right. I was worried about the fresh jalapeños being too spicy for my wife, but the heat cooked out of them.   Really, Stella`s! I`m so glad you moved into the neighborhood.

WARM ARTICHOKE SPREAD - if you love artichoke dip... This it`s the one for you. This is my favorite favorite. I always order 2 of these.   SWEET N` SPICY PEPPER JAM & GOAT CHEESE - the creaminess of the goat cheese and the kick of the pepper jam... Is my jam! Lol  We did however order the butcher block and that was really good!

We read the reviews and we live in the neighborhood, so we thought it was worth a try. We had the chicken parmesan ($22.) and the eggplant parmesan ($19.) and we both found the sauce to be too sweet, and the egg plant was tough We also had the Caprese board ($12.) and the two mini cannolis ($10.). The cannolis were tasty and the Caprese board was OK. The real problem for us was the service. Our server seemed to do just enough which really wasn`t enough. We were never asked if we wanted parmesan cheese for our entrees, we had to flag someone down for that. We had to ask someone for bread and also we had to request water. When we asked dor the cheese, we were given a shaker of cheese that you would find in your local pizzeria. My wife observed a table behind us getting the fresh cheese from a cheese grater.These are items that should be offered without needing to be requested. When the cannoli`s arrived, they were on a single small plate. We were not given dessert plates of silverware.  I found the plating of my entree to be really lacking. The chicken cutlet was in the middle of a large plate. The pasta was in a separate bowl. You come to expect nicer plating when you are paying higher prices.  All in all, it was not what we expected and we will not be returning.<1<10<2019<20<29<40

We`ll definitely return!<10<12<2019<17<6<38

Then I proceeded to wait 45 minutes to get helped. My daughter was supposed to get just polish. I sit down with the gentleman owner and he takes off the wrap and one of the nails is much shorter. I mention it not blaming him just confused how it happened and he says lady you know you came in like that. At that point I just want to get this over with. He shortens them all to match. Then I mention no one has done my daughters nails. They take her back at this point it`s been an hour (we were told 15 minutes). He did ok on the nails but at the end he has me put my nails under the UV. I ask why as I go to another place and there is no light for the dip. He claims it will only last a week if they don`t. Mine at the other place last a month. After he is done he goes and starts talking in another language and all the techs look at me. Guy I know you are saying something about me. So unprofessional. Then he come back and says no charge for the color on my daughter.  No thank you I`ll pay. I`m not here for a freebie but be sure I won`t be back. The only nice part is the young daughter who is in junior high working the front. Go to Glitter Bar on Gilbert they are the best! So nice there unlike here.<14<1<2018<1<15<44

First things first, your front desk staff was excellent!  Polite, friendly, professional and thorough!  Drop off / Ethan Dally:  December 3, 2019. Rushed, lack of concern, interrupted me so many times, I never completed a full sentence, unprofessional and uncaring.  I mentioned I literally just had an alignment done two days prior to the accident and will be traveling 1200 miles and want to make sure the alignment is ok since the accident.  I`ve was told that Gerber doesn`t do that and based on the damage '"won`t be needed'".  I also noticed when driving to Gerber that my CD player was now jammed.  I asked if they would please adjust/remove the CD.  When discussing the process and materials/parts, it was disclosed Gerber would be using either after market parts and or salvaged parts.  I said I was not happy with that.  My BMW has never been in an accident and should not have used, or after market pieces parts on it!  He said ok and I signed the papers.  He said he would be in touch with me on Thursday.  No call on Thursday.  The call came Friday that parts would hopefully be in by Monday.   Pick Up:  December 9, 2019 Ethan Dally received a call that my vehicle  was complete and I could pickup any time prior to closing.  I arrived a 1/2 hour later.    Again, front desk was  excellent!  I left work with  a friend to arrive promptly to your branch in Hudson.  Upon arrival Mr. Dally said he forgot something.  Upon returning, he started the passenger air bag screen was still not fixed.  We wait!  Now 25 minutes in the car is back in the garage.  He again comes back and says he needs to make a call.  While he is doing that, I ask if the alignment was done.  I asked about the CD.. to which I received a '"no, the car doesn`t need it, and we don`t get paid to do that'". I again said, I requested this upon arrival... he abruptly left, grabbed the parts of my car that were fixed and said this is what we fixed,it does not need it, turned and litterally  threw the parts back into and onto the garage floor.  I walked over to snap a photo of that and someone rushed to pick them up.  Now on the phone... 10 minutes later it is declared that the car is not done and the screen needs to be reset and can`t be done until Tuesday.  I am livid.  I left work... a friend left work to take me - now we are both out of 2 hours of pay!  He went on to say this and that, and how busy he was, the only one there... etc.  I did tell him, he was defensive and making excuses, and unprofessional by throwing car parts.  Not one time did he apologize, not one time did he approach me in an understanding and compassionate manner.  I then said, so basically what you are saying is the car is not ready, you failed to do your job prior to calling me to pick up my vehicle, that I have been without for now a week.  His response .. '"well yes but it`s not my fault'".  Again, the last thing a customer wants to hear ...  He represents Gerber, he released the call to be made, he failed to check / inspect the vehicle prior to releasing it... it is your fault!!!   So here we are.. now 8 days.  No car, no alignment, no cd fixed, very poor customer service, and lack of care and concern.    We will see what Tuesday brings...  I will then update.   Your saving grace was the young lady at the front desk!   So the WOW factor you speak about... needs work, a lot of work!"<10<12<2019<10<24<11

They told me to email them, which I have done four times and still no response. I have also called twice. After spending upwards of $10,000 or more in their office on surgery, plus years and years of visits, procedures, contacts, and glasses, it really should not be this difficult to simply get an answer back.

Andy`s Frozen Custard started in Missouri, and I am so happy to see that they have expanded to Arizona. The custard is made fresh throughout the day so it is perfectly creamy, and you can see the custard being made through the giant windows.   Aside from being fresh, the custard is super tasty too. The options seem endless. You can get it plain in vanilla flavor, make it a sundae, create a concrete, or get it in drinkable form as a shake, malt, or float. Depending on your mood, there is something to satisfy your sweet tooth. I prefer getting a concrete, and my favorite flavors are the triple chocolate and mint chip.   There is no seating inside, but there are a few seats and plenty of standing space outside. There is also a drive-through as well. Eat your custard quickly though, because it will melt fast on a hot day. Forget about screaming for ice cream. Scream for custard instead.<9<12<2019<8<49<53

J`apprécie particulièrement l`ambiance, les détails de la déco et surtout l`authenticité des plats.  Évidemment, tout est beaucoup moins piquant qu`en Thaïlande mais ça rend la nourriture plus accessible aux palais sensible, sans toutefois en sacrifier le goût.  La soupe du jour, que je devine Tom Yum, était vraiment savoureuse tout comme les plats de résistances. Le seul petit bémol pour moi est que tout est un peu trop sucré à mon goût. Je suis plutôt habituée au goût Laotien, qui est plus amer, acide et piquant mais je pense que ce restaurant plaira aux fans de Général Tao de ce monde qui veulent sortir de leur zone de confort.  L`endroit est exigu mais sympa, le service courtois et l`ambiance cozy.  Vous paierez en moyenne un peu plus cher qu`ailleurs mais c`est normal pour Outremont.  J`y retournerai avec plaisir pour découvrir plus de leurs versions des classiques de cuisine Thaï qui ne sont malheureusement pas disponibles le midi ou ailleurs par le fait même. Je rêve d`un Khao Soi ou d`un Kuai Tiao Ruea aka Boat Noddle Soup.  À suivre...<12<12<2019<23<35<49

Cioppino came with two perfectly cooked shrimp, some unknown small pieces of fish, two mussels with the smallest insides ever and one clam which had not opened.  The calamari appetizer tasted excellent and would have been better served other than room temperature.  My grandson`s swordfish was cooked well but again not hot. The problem with the temperature of the food was that the wait staff seemed overworked and we were left waiting while our food was up on the counter.<6<1<2017<23<17<5
pv8XwHptErfQBc7LgNJ_2g<nB1k_D08ybNk_CS-a3fAyw<o4LdEG8HDMvBXKvJeWPShQ<1<3<0<0<"We had been here several times, previously. On our first couple of visits, years ago, we were delighted to find authentic Thai, ample portions and good prices.   It`s clear that standards have changed and practices here now border on criminal. Our family was quickly seated, we placed our order and it arrived reasonably quickly. Except that most was barely edible. We had satay, pad see yew and two other dishes, all items were very familiar with. After two bites, it was clear the owners here have made significant changes. We were used to fresh ingredients, rich sauces and fragrant dishes. What we got seemed like it was from frozen. Everything was dry, bland or sweetened with white sugar. One dish was sent back outright, as being entirely inedible.  Here`s where it gets strange. When the bill arrived, she insisted on charging for food we couldn`t eat. We got a series of excuses. Then we were told it was '"cash only'". No cards whatsoever are accepted - even though the machinery was clearly present on the counter. We had to walk to an ATM to pay for the meal and food we couldn`t eat. When I re-confirmed she was charging us for dishes that were sent back, she shrugged and rang it up.  We feel robbed. We will not be back.  What used to be a small, hidden gem has clearly deteriorated into a shameful cash-grab, one that doesn`t care about customers. Be very cautious of any business that insists on charging you for food a dog wouldn`t eat and one that only accepts cash. Thai Sep won`t last much longer."<21<3<2019<0<0<44
QUCXTnLZcH999S9udJ-F0Q<W37KqgMymarQaqYGOWS70w<TLp092gHMUnGPDE0U8gSxg<1<7<2<0<"I just got a SECOND rent increase letter from them. I`m fed up.  We got our 10`x20` unit for $313/month + tax and insurance.  Our first increase was 7.6% after 6 months. Just to give you an idea regular rent increases are capped at 2.5% per year according to the Ontario Landlord and Tenant Act. Then I saw them advertising the same size the unit for $299/month, but when we called to ask why the difference they said that unit is on the SECOND FLOOR. NOWHERE On their website does it say that; no small print, no astrix, I have a screen shot of it. When we first signed up we were never told about any difference in price or premium storage locker locations, only different sizes.  If you complain you`ll get a non-answer from Alex Dubinsky, Regional Manager. His response to my email was:  '"Rent increases, as well as pricing, are based on many various criteria. One such item is our operational costs which would include items such as heat, electricity, insurance taxes etc.  Our prices fluctuate and the current market rate for a comparable unit is now $350.99 per month.  The rate which you rented your unit at was the going rate at the time of your rental.'"  Um, at what point did electricity increase 7% !? I have the entire communication if you`re interested, but long story short, don`t get sucked in with '"first month free'".   Our rental rate for a 10`x20` unit went from $313/month to $371.96/month in 18 months.  Their contract (which doesn`t say anywhere which FLOOR the unit is on) stipulates that they can increase your rent at any time, for any amount. I would warn everybody to be aware of their bad business practices, and of course always read what you sign. We assumed they were nice people and that the contract was a formality. Life lesson learned. Also their insurance is mandatory and basically doesn`t cover anything. Find somewhere else to store your stuff.  I haven`t received a customer satisfaction survey, I wonder why.   OH I almost forgot; they advertise that their 10`x20` unit will fit the contents of a 3-bedroom house, it doesn`t. And the BBB won`t help you. Makes me just want to go and live in the woods, enough with this garbage."<22<9<2014<22<43<32

C1Pq2fG6y9TQSofONvC6ng<q_CAgG4x-1K0jTRUtzJz2Q<qexXi_05w29lxWxvrMGJlA<1<3<0<0<"I took my two cats in this weekend to get groomed.  Each cat kennel had their names and our phone numbers written on them in big black sharpie. We also filled out paperwork stating the specific work to be done to each cat.  Then it was further discussed in detail over the phone what I wanted done.  Both of them had been to Bonanza for grooming before. One is big and is a male.  The other is a petite little female.  The female was to be sedated and given a lion cut; she hates being brushed and we have to do this once a year or so.  The male just needed his chin area trimmed because he likes to play in water and starts to smell like a wet sponge; we had also asked for his rear end to be trimmed.  I got a phone call halfway through the trimming that Patch, the big male, had lost 3 pounds and that it was a significant weight loss for a cat.  They asked if I would approve blood work. I thought it was odd because they had just been in to their regular vet for shots and their weight was fine so I declined the blood work. They also told me they accidentally cut him and he needed stitches!  We would have to come back in 2 weeks to have the stitches removed.  I was shocked when my son picked up the cats to find out they had completely switched the cats.  The one that only needed a chin trim had a complete lion cut, the one with all the mats only got a trim.  Worst of all...they put the big male under sedation WITHOUT PERMISSION.  They charged me FULL PRICE and then told me they would do the other one at no charge since they screwed up.  I asked to speak to the office manager.  I told her how shocked I was at such a blatant error, then to add insult to injury, they injured my cat - gave it stitches - and then charged full price!!!!  The office manager tried to blame the injury on the fact that '"Patch'" had lost so much weight and had so much skin hanging.  Kind of like I was a bad owner who wasn`t caring for my cats.  She eventually agreed to refund the money.  We made arrangements to go back the next day to get the correct cat done.  The next day I decided there was no way I was going back.  I realized that there was no weight loss at all.....they switched the cats.  The male is large, the female petite.  Callie is the one that ended up with the stitches, not Patch.  Thank goodness I hadn`t wasted money on blood work.  Wonder why it didn`t seem odd to them that one cat gained 3 pounds and the other lost 3 pounds??? Further, how do they switch a male and female without knowing?  Especially with their names written on each kennel!!!!  It was clearly visible that Patch was a male after they trimmed every existing piece of hair off him!  Anyway - what a cluster.  Really just inexcusable.  Mixed up the cats, tried to convince me one needed bloodwork due to severe weight loss, injured one cat and got stitches, then charged me full price.  Shocked and disappointed."<18<1<2016<23<29<15

I was having a hankering for some Mexican food. This isn`t really authentic Mexican, it`s more of a street taco type of situation. You sit down, and they have a pad of paper that has a checklist on it. You basically just check what kind of shell you want and what kind of toppings you want on your taco. The way just comes and takes your drink order and the little slips with your taco order on it. A few minutes later, voila! Your perfect tacos are delivered! Love the atmosphere. Fast service.

After I was treated with disregard by the grumpy owner at Medina Bicycle Shop last week, I needed a pick-me-up.  Thankfully in his dismissal, he referred me to Century Cycles.  Talk about making lemonade from lemons. . this was nothing short of a divine appointment!    Bob Soroky greeted me at Century Cycles and treated me like I was his only customer. When I explained that I bought a bike off of Craig`s List and needed a professional to look it over and make sure it was safe and in good condition, he graciously obliged.  I wheeled my Schwinn to the back of the store and was pleased at how friendly all of the staff were!  Not a grumpy one in the bunch.  Bob and the crew kept me entertained with their sense of humor and did well to make sure my bike was in good shape.  I even brought a new seat in and asked them to replace my old one, and they did. . free of charge!  Plus, Bob shared with me about several community riding events, the best time to bring my bike in for a tune-up, and never once did he try to sell me anything.    I sang the praises of Century Cycles for the rest of the day to anyone who would listen, and was tempted to take that song over to the curmudgeon at Medina Bicycle Shop.

The beer selection is pretty good, featuring local brewery Joseph James even.  We started with a dozen oysters from their Raw Bar, which didn`t last long with our group.  I don`t know what I expected, but their oysters weren`t good, they were great.  I ordered the Chicken Curry with potato, green beans, peanuts, mushrooms, lime & cilantro.  It`s quite good, but if you`re looking for spicy heat, this isn`t that kind of dish.<17<3<2013<16<57<7
oOrUgu3zXzAqKWvwfmN9uA<WX8Swp5F172BHz9IKqPISw<cnTRpe5uBp82RdrfW9QShg<5<9<1<1<I have been intending to write this review for some time now. Four years ago I fostered my first dog for Lotsadogs Rescue and have now fostered 59 dogs in total and adopted one plus my son adopted one. That is a lot of hearts still beating that had they not come into rescue their story would have ended! Susan Steiner, the operator, puts the needs of the dogs ahead of the desires of the applicants. Why? Because the majority of these dogs have been so badly let down by... you guessed it... people!  So if it is about your ego and not about being the leader needed to give one of her dogs a healthy, happy, and safe life then do not apply. If you do apply be thorough with you application. There are rules. Most of them have been added to the list as a result of people feeling entitled. These are non-negotiable so read them and follow them they are clearly stated. Your application process will go much more smoothly.  What do you get? You get a healthy dog and a period of consultation & behavioural support to help your adoption transition go as smoothly as possible. We have kept our dog on the raw diet recommended and manufactured by Susan Steiner with excellent results.  We also Board our dog through Camplotsadogs when necessary and she is always healthy and very happy we we drop her off and pick her up.  So maybe the operator is more concerned about the dogs than about your feelings but that is because dogs are the priority at this rescue.  My family is not unique in our commitment to foster and fund raise for this rescue. We are but one of many. So ask yourself if it was so bad how would they have remained in business, have a committed volunteer base, have repeat adopters, and have successfully rehomed so many amazing dogs?!<9<4<2017<6<54<26

I`m not sure what happened when other people stayed here, but our stay was awesome.  We were flying in late and arriving to the Rio super late.. I checked in online and was told to get my key from the '"keys'" line at the front desk- super painless experience, under 10 minutes! We grabbed our keys and ventured to the elevator to bring us to our room in the Masquerade Tower. Our room was perfect- big, clean and in an awesome spot. I loved looking out our window to view the hotels on the strip, and we also had a view of the hotel`s zipline (which kept me entertained all hours of the day). Housekeeping always came kind of later in the day, which was perfect for us because we needed those extra hours of sleep when drinking all night lol. Room service was kind of pricey, but it always is! However, it was fast and of good quality.  The Rio has great bars and restaurants.. It even has a starbucks that is open 24 hours on the weekend! Though I felt the casino didn`t have the best selection of slot machines, I still had no problem spending all my $$$.  I choose this hotel strictly because we were going to the Penn and Teller show.. However, I would definitely stay here again! A very pleasant experience!"<22<1<2016<6<46<31

She also does my blonde hair, which is naturally brown. She`ll work with you to determine what you want and what works for you.  The salon itself is also very nice and clean. There is a small downstairs area, and a much larger area upstairs. The layout is pretty cool and it kind of makes you feel like you`re in a cool lofty hair salon in NYC.

The restaurant was small, modern and clean. They offered a very small lunch menu. I had a burger as did one of my companions and the other chose the chicken sandwich. I had a side salad with mine and my friends both chose fries. The portions were extremely small but we enjoyed our meals. I would say the burger was 3-4 ounces and the salad was only a small handful of spring mix with a few golden raisins and very few vegetables. I found it strange that the didn`t offer ranch dressing and only had three dressings to choose from. (A Caesar, a citrus and a wine vinaigrette) it was definitely what I would consider a light lunch.<9<11<2019<22<27<26

Despite the fact that Asian Corner Mall looks like a zombie apocalypse just came through, I really enjoyed my Banh Mi.  I ordered the #6 Thit Nuong (roast pork) and the #7 Dac Biet (combo of all deli style meats).  The roast pork was served warm, marinaded well, and was moist and not dried out.  The combo was also good and loaded with meat.  All of the meat is packed perfectly into the sandwich so you get a taste of everything in a single bite.  The daikon carrots and veggies along with the cilantro were fresh and delicious while the fresh jalapeños were really spicy.  The pate/mayo spread was flavorful, and they didn`t over due it, which is a common mistake.  The bread was light and perfectly toasted.   Overall, the Banh Mi`s at Le`s were very good and filling.  They`re a full baguette size and for only $3.50-$4.00, they`re a great deal.  You`ll be more than full and satisfied after eating one of their Banh Mi sandwiches.  I would highly recommend trying one if you`re looking to venture out from the typical American sub.<2<8<2015<17<36<1

I went there for dinner and was pleased with what I ordered.  I`ve had my fair share of pho in my life so I would say this place is pretty solid and has everything you expect from a regular pho without any extras. I always go for the pho dac biet XL, and this bowl of pho is no different from any other good pho place. For 11$, I was more than full as the bowl was filled with different cuts of meats.   I will come back to try their other offerings in their menu!<10<11<2019<2<18<25
kvO39cWBQYr8aY0brgmhfA<GtWXLPk8sPn8yyIFP3eRKg<3uC7Lbc3RgUDTWQlBu4PqQ<2<6<1<1<This pains me to give Bouchon this review and I really hoped it was going to be higher as I had such high hopes!   I lived in Paris for a while and love a great croissant in the morning. I heard there was a bouchon here and thought I`d try it. I also heard they have good macarons so thought I`d give that a go as well.  If you like really good croissants, don`t get there`s. Honestly, it tasted like a day old croissant from Costco. Not that there isn`t a place for those, but it isn`t at an extremely reputable patisserie.   More disappointing than the croissant was the raspberry macaron. It is currently sitting here next to me half uneaten and I can`t decide whether I should finish eating it or not.  If you have had really good macarons either here or in Paris you know it shouldn`t be crunchy at all, not hard, but perfectly doughy and fall apart in your mouth as your lips close on it.  This macaron, again, tastes a day old, it`s hard,crunchy, and too cold.   If you haven`t had a macaron before, don`t have this one or else you`ll think macarons themselves are disappointing. The flavor is ok, however.   Verdict: if you like real authentic croissants and macarons, dont come here.   Tant pis...<23<9<2016<17<24<0

Te BR is tiny with the sink in the open and when you are 2 in a room it is not a good idea. Worst concept ever. I like to go in a bathroom and and just relax nd have space. It feels like a cramped clost wit not enough room for 2 prople to stand or even turn around. It may be the only think that will keep me from returning.  The good, the staff is just OK. I have seen nicer. I have more rude staff. The food is kick-ass great free breakfast. It varies frm day to day but this incleds fresh fruits, many cerals (named brand in the pacakge or those gross dispensers.) Not a fan of tose. About 10 different kinds. Yougurts, waffles nmade by the kitchen, french toast, bagels toast etc, hot egg, ham, turkey, backon, biscuit combos that vary. Very tasty. Great coffee. Not soapy or weak tastig like other hotels. The lobby is nice and the eating area and little Stabuck stand , drinks and snaks are very nice.  I wish I can place the room design of noter hotel with te perks of this hotel.

Boney Fingers is located in the indoor mall downstairs. I came for an early breakfast and the staff was so warm despite the hour.

She`s very talented and super sweet. She cut my hair into an angled bob and I loved it. Then she added an oaky brown gloss to it which was ten dollars extra ( which is nbd because the cut in itself was $23, which is very inexpensive for the Madison down town area.  The second time I went, I wasn`t as impressed. I walked in and no one greeted me. The two desk ladies looked at me like I was an alien and made the whole sign in and sit down process pretty awkward. One of them ended up being my stylist and tried to make small talk, but seemed pretty ingenuine ( she complained about people wanting their hair styled after hair cuts...which I thought was a complimentary service for a cut)  I asked for an angled bob, like last time, and asked if I could have a gloss to tone down the orange in my hair. She said that would be a toner and I assumed the pricing would be the same as the gloss, but nope it wasn`t.  Toner, which is color correction on the service menu, is priced upon consultation. The stylist didn`t make any effort to tell me the toner wouldn`t be priced as gloss. In fact, she didn`t even tell me a price she just put it on.  I ended up paying 20 for the cut and what I assume to be 50 for the color correction because my total was 70. The hair cut was decent but didn`t blow my mind and the color toned out the orange but some parts were green.  If I was going to pay $50 for color correction, I would want different toners used on my highlights and base color. She literally just put a one and done coat now I have some green ends. $6 Box dye could have looked better<17<12<2015<22<5<16

I had never heard of it and was surprised that it was right here on the Westside. There is a small parking lot, but it wasn`t crowded when I got there. I was greeted by the owner Jay, and told that there was a limited menu. He just had a busy day, but there were enough items left for me to choose from. I selected chicken wings, lake trout, collards, cabbage, cornbread and fries. The drinks and desserts were sold out. I also had some of his homemade sauce.   The food was hot and delicious! The fish was seasoned and cooked just right. The wings were tasty, they could have used more spice but it might have made it salty. The collards were on point and so was the cabbage. Cornbread was sweet,fluffy and I had it for dessert. The fries were also good, not too greasy.   I will try this spot again, next time I will go earlier so I can try some of the other items reviewers are raving about.

The chatter from behind the counter was professional and the food good although my entree salad might have benefited from being a little fuller.

Bojangles is second but Popeyes offers better selection and some shrimp options.  Fries and sauces are also better.  Skin is always crispy and delicious.  Cajun spicy is also an option and its cayenne pepper!  Biscuits are the problem.  Worst biscuits in the industry even when fresh.  Bojangles has the best biscuits.   Even their stale buscuits beat Popeyes.  KFC is the worst for both chicken and biscuits. The only problem at this location had to do with the return of the chicken biscuit.  All locations are experiencing huge lines.  Due to this they rushed things and cut the cooking time short to get the lines down.  This made the sandwhich less than it`s great crunchy self.  The other thing they do is make a boatload of sandwiches ahead of time and put them in those steam bags like chick fil a.  If they sit in their a little too long, bye bye crunch. Take the time and do it right.  I heard all the people around me complain of the same thing that visit.<12<11<2019<14<4<10

Their vision & desire to train and raise up leaders is something that has changed my life entirely. They preach timely, relevant messages that are always full of the Holy Spirit and applicable to anyone who desires to know God more. They run a School of Ministry that I started right after grade school where you can be trained in ministry and receive a degree while you`re at it. They also help the community doing outreaches all over the city, also by giving away food many times through out the week. They are on a mission to win back America!

Needless to say, this Thai spot fell short of edible. The drunken noodles were sub par and only enhanced my friends funny tummy from the drink he had had earlier. My real beef was with the Pad Thai. It was terrible. I had to ask for multiple different sauces and spices to even try to eat it.  If I wanted to cook i would have stayed home and Gordon Ramsesed it up. I asked about the noodles as they were not noodles that are normally used for this dish and was told that these were the ones they used. The noodles were almost crunchy and a little dry. Little was done by staff to rectify the situation and we ended up down the street eating A slice of pizz from Evel Pie. Try Thai somewhere else!!!

The service was decent as well. Went with a group of kids and adults. We had a lot of issues with our lane which was kind of annoying, but I get it. I had to ask for time to be added back on our lane, and I was given a hard time the second time. The real reason im giving 3 stars is because an inhaler was left behind by one of the kids I was with and when I called first thing the next day, no one had a clue. Now I know most businesses are not responsible for lost items, but we left pretty late, and they clean each table as soon as the group leaves, because we watched this happen quite a few times next to us. It`s an inhaler, like why would you throw it away, and why would someone it. I think they should get a better system at when kids or anyone for that matter leaves a prescription behind.<17<11<2019<21<16<3

Michael, the office manager is an unusual character.  After my first appointment, and subsequent ones, instead of simply paying by bill at the counter and scheduling a next appointment like at a normal office, I was made to go sit in Michael`s office to be sold all sorts of add-one while four pictures of my post-dental cleaning mouth was displayed on his computer monitor.  It`s a device to shame and discomfort people: no one`s mouth looks healthy after being scratched and proved for an hour--I`ve never had a cavity and one of my grandmothers was a dentist, for example, and yet I was made to feel like I needed at least 3 visits a year and all these extra services for my allegedly poor dental hygiene.  Michael also likes to make passive aggressive comments about clients` careers and interests after proving for them.  For example, on my first visit, he asked what I did for a living.  When I told him about my career, at the time, as a copywriter and editor for businesses` and individuals` online media, he said Back, '"oh, you`re a blogger!'" And then, he ran around the office to at least two others saying '"Halina here is a blogger! Isn`t that neat?'" I was not a '"blogger.'"  I was sold a lot of services that I did not need and was told by Muneeza, my hygienist, that I had to get them for the sake of my health.  For example, while I was laying back on the dental chair, Muneeza insisted that, because I have asthma, I simply have to get this expensive cavity protectant, above and beyond the fluoride treatment I was already purchasing every time.  I questioned why, since I am in my 30s and have never had a cavity.  She continued pressuring me with scary what-ifs and insistence that if I didn`t do it, I would surely end up with a disastrous mouth on my hands.  Still supine, uncomfortable and vulnerable,  I let her do the expensive procedure that we hadn`t scheduled because I was exhausted from her high-pressure sales and just wanted to be done.  Muneeza consistently pushes high-cost products and acts like the need for them is dire.  She also won`t shut up about her children`s achievements or her wealthy extended family during cleanings.  I would often leave utterly exhausted from hearing the same story over and over again, with the only change being that the kids were a few months older.  Getting a dental cleaning and related services should not feel like stepping out into the car dealership showroom floor, and then into the negotiating room.  However, at this office, it surely does."<4<2<2018<14<33<33

The menu is a bit confusing because there`s a few different menus, and some of the waitresses don`t speak fluent English. It took us a good 20-30 minutes to decide, and luckily we had a Chinese-speaking person in our group. The food itself was amazing and tasted really good and flavorful (we got it cooked in Hong Kong style). It was quite an experience and we were all stuffed for a good day and a half lol.

I`m Hawaiian and I`m pretty fond of Hawaiian food.  Checked out the menu and saw that there weren`t many options for the vegetarians out there :(  But, it is Hawaiian food (aka rice and meat central) and I knowingly took the risk.  Lucky for me I am a pescetarian so I divulged on the Mahi Burger.  Being used to the Vegas version of the '"L&L'" mahi I was actually expecting something subpar and didn`t expect the sandwich to be actually pretty dang good!  The fish was fresh and that`s all you can really ask for in a mahimahi burger.  They also let me substitute my fries with kim chee and I must say - the kim chee here is SO good!  I`m not really into the saucy kim chees out there and their kim chee hit the spot.  My fiancee had the '"Local Plate'" which consisted of BBQ beef and chicken, two scoops of rice, a scoop of mac salad AND two musubis for 8.50!  What a deal!  She barely finished it because there was so much food to try and digest.  I did try some her mac salad to compare to the mac salad from back at home but it didn`t compare so I passed on eating more of it.  Overall, I thought the food here was actually pretty grubbin`.  Four stars for the lack of veggie stuffs but thumbs up to making a killer mahi sammich.  Would I visit here again?  Pretty sure I will.  Right down the street from my house so why not?  Nice to eat some Hawaiian food other than the L&L and Aloha Kitchen usual I frequent.  More updates soon I`m sure."<18<8<2010<6<56<45

About 25,000 to 35,000 particpants from all over the country and the world. It is somewhat organized. Needs work but everything in the end becomes a successful event. From my experience, come very very early to the Start Village. So you won`t stress yourself especially if you are a competitive runner. Enjoy the music and the runners perks they offer.

RzlNieFB06qI6sp7mKjLHQ<8IpHHhSl7rkllsj3a3dcAw<TixzyU4Zay38tbGbWMlQYQ<1<0<0<0<Today I  went to Etobicoke Veterinary Hospital in a panic. My dog has been vomiting and not able to keep food or water down for two days. I called in around 5:40pm and the receptionist said to come in immediately they could see my dog if I got there by 6:00pm and I explained that we were previous patients and this was a emergency situation. Due to rush hour traffic we got there around 6:05pm by the time the receptionist acknowledged our presence she was quick to remind us that we didn`t get there exactly by 6:00pm. They asked us to come by tomorrow, however, we were already there waiting, and pleaded that they at least see if there was anything they could do to help. The receptionist went back two times to talk to someone at the back, and then we overheard the vet technician explain that she wasn`t going to see our dog. We quickly stated that we tried our best to get there by 6:00pm but there was traffic, she then got extremely defensive stating that we should of said we were going to be late, and they don`t have to see our pet today. We explained it was emergency situation, and we didn`t anticipate the 5 minute delay. But I was immediately appalled by their total lack of empathy for the situation. They did not refer us to another clinic, or even ask for further details regarding what was wrong with our dog, but simply refused to see us. The outrageous part is that their posted hours of operation state that they close at 6:30pm.  As I left the clinic I let them know that we would find a new vet for both our dogs. The tech rudely stated she would gladly fax over our paperwork. Both my dogs will be finding a new vet now. Both of them were patients, and I was even at the clinic  last week for my dog`s rabies, and DA2PP shots.   Being loyal/paying customers does not matter to this clinic.   I would not advise anyone to go here if you have an emergency situation with your pet.<23<11<2019<3<21<22

We called the store and spoke to Nicholas the appliance department manager.   He was awesome! Had the issue resolved in less than 4 hours and our new dryer dropped off and installed within two days.   Amazing!

Upon arrival, the lady asked for my cash upfront so I gave her the $40, tried to explain the phone convo to her & although she nodded in agreement I had a feeling there was a language barrier. After the massage she stood with my water and I asked for my change. Instead she just kept pointing to the tip sign and saying '"I massage now you tip.'" I tried to explain that the change was for her but she kept getting more and more frustrated and, quite frankly, hostile. She just kept repeating that I needed to tip her. I asked her for someone who spoke English so she called someone up that was a little bit better and seemed to understand. She kept telling my masseuse to shut up until she finally stormed off. I asked her to make sure she got the $10 and she said she would.  I understand the language barrier; I understand it`s not the most glamorous job, but there is absolutely no place for that.

pb2SKRRzjbjpSL19Cj_qFA<9V4tgssm8MC1bjjilkhsdg<utIA0LyQmwP-9DRyxUe6qQ<4<3<1<0<"I`m only putting 4 stars because if they get bad reviews they pay to push them to the bottom.  The food IS really great, but expect a 3 hour dining experience. You will always wait.  We even came once on a Monday and still had to wait an hour for a table.  I wouldn`t mind it so much if it was just because they were that busy. It`s actually because there bussing and service is unbelievable slow. Every time I have put my name in for the hour long wait, I`ve walked through the restaurant and counted 12-13 open tables.  Half haven`t been bussed and half have. The problem is that these tables usual sit unoccupied for a about 10 minutes.    Now that we`re past that portion of the wait, you need to realize you will wait a long time before your server appears.  You should also order everything you plan to eat the first time you see the server because who knows when they`ll be back. It will also take forever to get your order, even drinks.  If you order a beer it will come about 20 minute later, as though they had to make it. All it takes is walking to a cooler and taking out a can, but somehow takes 20 minutes. Also on the beer, once we ordered beers and 20 minute later they arrive with it and ask if we want mugs. '"Sure!'" then the woman puts two piping hot glasses.  '"Thank you for the Scorching hot mug for my cold beer!'"    When you do finally get your order and finish your meal, be ready to wait again.  It has taken us all of a half hour to 45 min to get and pay the check.   So if your ready to make this trip your entire day, the food is fairly good.  But not the best you can find in the area."<24<11<2017<17<54<4

After going, I would definitely say it is not worth a long wait. If you have to go, try looking for less busy times.   The food was okay. I ordered a pancake sampler. My issue with the food is that any of their sweeter breakfast items (pancakes, waffles, etc) are just way too sweet. It feels like everything is just drowned in sugar. Also, I ordered a cortado, and just wasn`t good, though it is a bit hard to compete with all the specialty coffee shops in that area. The savory food items were decent, and the prices were as well. The staff was nice too.   It`s not that this place is bad. It is definitely decent, it just doesn`t match my tastes. I think that for me personally it is not worth the very long waits I always see.

Unfortunately they are in visible areas otherwise I wouldn`t have cared. The service was a bit on the expensive side which is where my disappointment stems from, although I know that once I bring my vehicle in again they will correct the mistakes.   I also was disappointed that my visor strip was so thin and short. I have had a few vehicles have this option installed and I have never seen one as short as the one installed on my vehicle. Upon pickup I did complain about it and was informed that if after a few days I was still unsatisfied they would go ahead and replace it. I am waiting until I have another day off to bring in my vehicle.   Overall I would recommend this shop to those looking to tint their windows, the staff is courteous, understanding, and respectful.

Then a group of 4 walks in, is met with a perky waitress exclaiming `Welcome to Boiler 65!` Hugs are exchanged and the group is seated a head of everyone. A women from the large group makes eye contact with me and says `Did you see that? Do you see what`s happening here?`   We did.

The brisket was tender and tasty with a smoke flavor.  He has two sauces, a Memphis style with some sweetness but a little heat at the end and a Mustard.  Both are good but I preferred the Memphis style. I received 3 sides with my order of 1/2 pound of brisket and all were very good.  The smoked beans were smoked and with two types of beans and some bacon, very tasty but the black beans were a little to crunchy.  The sweet potato casserole was very sweet and the Mac & Cheese had a nice combination of cheese and flavor.  The meal was so large that I was able to get two meals out of it.

It`s definitely a hole-in-the-wall place but with an open ambiance.  No matter what, you HAVE to get the chocolate chip cookie. They use flat chocolate chips so the distribution is even but at different layers throughout the cookie, and it makes all the difference. There are only a handful or so made each day, so make sure to go early as there can be a lunch rush. (P.S. They give the last cookie of the day away for free!)  And of course the other main attraction - the sandwiches - are amazing too. I`m not even a sandwich kind of gal, but I recommend getting the focaccia bread with your sandwich. And I will definitely be back to try more of their sandwiches & their brunch items!<18<11<2019<20<14<28

The therapists are incredibly knowledgeable, friendly, professional, and focused on healing and eliminating pain. David met me after post spinal fusion surgery and he worked with me through the prescribed months of physical therapy from my surgeon to create movement where there was little to none at the start. David worked on stability, flexible, range of motion, and getting my body back to the new normal. David was great in tailoring my experience to fit what I needed in my recovery process to get me to see results! Thanks to David I am now back at the gym full time and working on my fitness goals again, pain free!  The office staff is also very helpful and responsive.<14<5<2019<2<14<7

I ordered a cat-back exhaust system from them in January. I misread the information on the part and had to return it. Upon emailing and explaining it was the wrong size and asking to return it, they tried to tell me that it would fit my truck, which of course as I had already told them, it would not.  They then replied and told me they would go ahead and set up the return and send me label instructions, but I would have to pay shipping to return it, as well as being charged the $38 for the shipping they paid to send it to me.  What happened to '"FREE SHIPPING'"?? After not hearing back from them for a week, I had to email them again and see what was going on, and they replied and told me they would follow it up and send it to me as soon as possible. After pestering them again, it only took a day for them to send me the label. They then tell you that you have to ship it with a tracking number AND insurance, and if you don`t it will take more time for them to process the return. Which makes no sense at all. Why would it take longer as they will still receive it at the same time. After much frustration I was finally able to return the product, which cost me a whopping $100 to return. Days after sending it back with guaranteed one day shipping I checked the tracking number and it said '"Item has been held by Canada Post by recipients request.'" Are you kidding me?!  After trying for almost two weeks to return a product you won`t even receive it when I send it? After receive the product and finally refunding me. It appears I was deducted $43 for their shipping cost instead of the $38 they had previously told me I would have to pay.  Once everything was over I started looking at other reviews, which I should have done before buying from them. Time after time it seems like they try to make it as hard as possible to make a return, so you get fed up and try to sell the product on Kijiji so they can keep their profit. One of the scummiest companies I`ve ever had to deal with.   Bottom line? TDOT Performance is a terrible company hiding behind a pretty website.  Do NOT waste your time here. Buy your products from ANYWHERE ELSE. Wrench Monkey, a junk yard, ANYWHERE. I`m all for supporting Canadian companies, but they don`t deserve it."<7<3<2019<5<3<50

o8w_a6oeGtVS63CdouxZNw<EVrfbnLZ4wNpNo0PuXzXqg<wrhPNdPh0FfSv3DMS0obhw<3<1<2<2<I was kind of underwhelmed by this aquarium. For the price you pay (in the mid to upper $40 range) I was expecting way more.  I like the area that it is in - located to a lot of other exhibits. You can package your exhibits together but when I asked the cashier they didn`t really explain what you could combine and not combine so I did a single admission to the aquarium.  Quite small and honestly too many fresh water/river fish for my taste. I want the jellies, exotic salt water fish - this I can`t see on a daily basis at my local aquarium back home.   I sat in on the otter talk and it was really informative and they throw food into the water to make the otters active which was nice. The keeper stuck around to answer some questions as well. There was a couple of touch tanks and then a domed tank as you take the escalator down which was the real high point for me.  All the shows come with the price of your ticket which is nice but there was much on the second floor. The aquarium concentrates on conservation and preservation efforts which is a huge plus I just which there were way more exhibits.<6<12<2019<23<3<47

It was a Saturday, just before 1.  After a few minutes a waiter saw us and said the hostess would seat us soon. There were a few tables of people, but there were also empty tables and they didn`t seem to be busy. While waiting, we watched a kid play with a bunch of toys in a booth near the kitchen - - my guess being a child of an employee. After a few more minutes the same waiter saw us again and said the hostess would be with us in a moment. Finally, after waiting 13 minutes, we left. Even if the hostess was too busy for us, at least the waiter could have seated us, but he didn`t find it in his job description. We went elsewhere, and were treated very well, and will be regulars there (already been back twice) instead of here.<24<3<2019<19<35<57
PWEGewmja1PIUfJbVwhCfg<Vat_ma6JZ6gA_InERCkXjg<MShDy9wlG2qijYJarDUSIw<1<1<0<0<Ok, let me Start off by saying the STAFF are GREAT. The lobby is yes, nice and cute, and the gym is pretty neat, but omg the room is horrible.   First of all, the pics online are SO deceiving. The room is SOOO small (we got a king), and the bathroom has a HORRIBLE stink to it. There`s no drinking water in the room (free or to purchase) and when house keeping comes, they forget towels lol there`s no robes or slippers. They have the smallest pillows to sleep on (we had to ask for more).  The on-site store they have is very pricey! While I get it`s a hotel, the prices are still ridiculous. The cable services is so outdated. Only like a some channels with no TV guide. It`s a glorified motel 6 I feel.    I hate it here. I`ve booked an entire week so I`m stuck but I hate it. I travel a lot, and been to amazing hotels and this sadly is not it! Stay away.<8<10<2019<14<34<58

That could have been because we went during the Super Bowl, but still, only 10 minute wait to see a provider is awesome.   The worst thing about this visit was the medical technician. She was so impersonal and obviously just terrible with people. She took my boyfriends vitals and didn`t say a word about what they were. Her questions were cold and uncaring. She looked at me with suspicion when I tried to help him answer some of the questions since he`s not the best at communicating how he`s feeling. Look, people who come to urgent care don`t want to be there. At least treat them kindly to make the experience a little bit better.   The doctor was fine. In my opinion, I think he didn`t take enough time to examine his patient (probably 3 minutes total) before prescribing him FIVE different meds. But at least he was more personable than the technician and took the time to introduce himself.   I`d go back only if there was no wait and it was extremely urgent.<4<2<2019<7<13<48
6koPK-wUFJvY9iI2pnAY_w<0911xXCgLexupPGkDJusLQ<lgiGMlWoS82ZRMvQ2hPkdg<5<1<0<1<"A shout out to Kayla R., Yelp, and Bally`s community for setting this up!! This was a amazing show!! Thank you so much for setting this up!!  Now, on to the review!  My daughter was super excited when I had mentioned we were going to see the Harry Potter Parody '"Potted Potter!'" Her and I are huge fans of Harry Potter. We`ve seen the movies, I`ve read the books, and we build countless of Harry Potter Legos! We`ve even been to Universal Studios California and we have our own personal Harry Potter Ones (electronic and non-electronic version)!  Our viewing was on Monday night, December 9th, at 8:00 P.M. We`re located way out in the Northwest of Las Vegas, so we ended up leaving the house around 6:30 P.M to give us ample enough time to pick-up the tickets and find the box office. Luckily, I was just recently at the Paris, so I knew where the self-parking was. If you haven`t been to Bally`s before, you find out that their self-parking is shared with local casinos as well. Google maps will bring you down the I-15/Flamingo, and then across Las Vegas Blvd. From there, you can find self parking. It is paid self-parking, so make sure to bring your ticket after the event to pay inside the casino. It took about 30 minutes to get to the casino, and park on the appropriate parking garage floor.  I wasn`t 100% certain on where to go, so as soon as my daughter and I got off the escalators, we went to the middle help area, with a few team members and asked where the Bally`s box office was. They had mentioned to us to take the right and walk-down the main entrance after the stores, follow the signs for the box office. It was pretty straight forward after we receive help from some of the Bally`s team members!! Thank you again!  Once we found the box office at around 7:20, there was no line. My daughter and I ended up walking to the counter. We informed the gentleman that we needed to pick up tickets. I showed him our yelp event and he had asked for ID. I provided the ID and my yelp profile. The tickets were gathered quickly and provided. I asked where the performance theater was to the gentleman, and he had mentioned from the box office, go straight down, past the first escalator and cafe (LavAzza), and then until you reach the second escalators next to Nosh.   My daughter was slightly hungry before the show. We ended up picking up a fruit cup and milk, $11.00, from LavAzza and then proceeded to doors opening for show at 7:30 P.M, and show starting at 8:00.  We ended up eating the fruit cut quickly before going to the VIP entrance. Once we had arrived in, the gentleman that was checking tickets, guided us to the entrance. There, pre-show, you could purchase beverages (and other selections over the age of 21+), and food. My daughter also wanted popcorn, $4.00. (and yes, she had dinner before coming!!). The popcorn was fresh, I had a few bites.  The doors opened approximately around 7:40 ish and then we proceeded in. My daughter, whom was 6, and I got super lucky, sitting towards the front.  The show only had 2 actors, Brendan and Scott. The show went through all 7 Harry Potter books! You didn`t need to be a expert on Harry Potter to understand from start to finish the Harry Potter series when walking out of the show. Brendan`s and Scott put on a amazing show!  My daughter absolutely loved it. She was laughing so loud. Some of her favorite parts were the '"dragon scene'" and the '"snake scene.'" She also liked when the entire audience got involved with the quidditch. You basically had a blow-up ball, trying to compete for each side of the show, whom would win the quidditch match, also selecting two audience members to be the seekers. Super fun!! The over-top acting and jokes, was great. It certainly was quite a experience and I would recommend it to anyone to see.  The actors had amazing energy and kept it going through-out the entire show. There was some amazing and unexpected moments, like the when the audience got sprayed with water on the super-soaker. I wasn`t also prepared for some of the, more geared, adult jokes or references, such as the Game of Thrones Reference or Narnia Reference.  The acting was spot-on. Their references to each character was unique and a breath of fresh air. I can`t believe they were able to cover the entire series in 70 minutes! My daughter and I really enjoyed this show."<13<12<2019<3<59<38

First off, bakery items (two of them) didn`t taste fresh, said it was this mornings but the chocolate croissant tasted at least a day old. It`s probably because it wasn`t a chocolate croissant but instead was a regular one which was cut in half and had chocolate spread inside. This is like an amateur version of chocolate croissant so disappointing.   The cheese soufflé was sub standard and the last time over a year ago that I had it, it was pretty good. Generally poor baked goods which is not great for a bakery.   Of course service is great, so at least that. There are other bakery options.<25<8<2019<17<36<1

The weekend-only braised beef and tendon has the perfect chewiness and QQ-ness. The flavors are a perfect mix of fresh and light with spicy and earthy. I don`t know how they do it, but they do!  The hand-pulled noodles are to die for. They are magically thin and springy. I ate mine like I hadn`t eaten in weeks.   My favorite meal yet in Toronto.<28<5<2018<2<36<20

We asked for a sample and this place requires that the employee provide you the sample, totally fine except she gave us one sample the disappeared into the back for 5 minutes leaving us waiting.  I loudly said '"excuse me'" and got no response, my wife opened the door to the back and said the same which got the girl back up front and rolling her eyes at my wife.  There were probably 8-10 people in the store waiting for her to help get samples to the various groups.  For the rest of the checkout process she was super short and really just didn`t care about anything going on around her.   The yogurt itself was pretty baseline for frozen yogurt.

Our friends had a good experience and their gate looks beautiful (as pictured with black framing and red composite wood).   I appreciated Gary taking time with us when he came out to give us a quote. He spent time helping us visualize what it would look like and helped us see what makes their gates better than the competition.   My favorite part of their gates is the privacy factor. They put metal privacy strips on the sides and then they cut the wood with a shiplap technique that makes it not have any gaps. When the kids are in our backyard, my husband and I are confident that the kids are safe.   We really love the gates and if we ever move to a new home and need gates, we will definitely use Action Gate.<31<7<2018<19<5<14

We got the first bad snow storm of the year today and my friend and I trekked from the office wasteland of Rockside Rd. This is one of the best lunch specials in town. You can get a soup or salad, curry, pad thai or basil fried rice plus a dessert for $10. I don`t have a sweet tooth so I opted for a soup and sald plus the entree instead. What a steal! They also offer this deal carryout until 5 or 6 PM. I only could finish half the curry dish so now I had lunch and dinner for the low. The owner was a warm and gracious host. I prefer this place to Charm Thai or whatever the one in the Rockside Commons plaza is. If you work in Independence or the surrounding area this lunch option is top notch. Lotus Thai House is up there with Gentile`s as my favorite.<12<11<2019<18<14<26

I was tame and ordered the chicken and beef fajitas. I would give it a 7/10. The guac and beans were delish but there was something amiss about the fajitas themselves. My hubby had different tacos and he enjoyed them all. I gave them 4 stars because I found it pricey for what we got. With tip, it cost me 80$.

fsHSFyVWVf-irwi9wI9n9w<65yB0ydGXOZ_-T6J_GbKfw<O4tQSOZIfuJLgyXNd8vN-Q<3<23<4<7<I`m neutral about this place.  If you were selected to be a part of the justice system albeit temporarily you are expected to be neutral, fair and to follow the law.  That`s what was expected of me when I came here to 361 University when I was mailed a summons to appear for jury pool selection.  This building is located behind Osgood Hall at Queen and University and behind this building is Toronto`s City Hall.  It is one of the courthouses for the Superior Court of Justice.  There is another office for the Superior Court of Justice located just up the street a bit at 393 University.  This is the more attractive and artsy looking building, not just a box.  The main public entrance faces University Avenue and requires individuals to pass through metal detectors and have their belongings scanned through a machine much like the way airport security is set up.    So from what I gathered in my short time there, this courthouse gathers prospective jurors on  Monday to appear at 8:30 am to be potential jurors.  The room on the ground floor which is the jury pool room seats hundreds of people, seemingly somewhere between 3 to 4 hundred.  Upon checking in the first time my summons was inspected by an officer to determine which of the 4 groups I`d be assigned to.  Each group had a color which were green, purple, red and blue.  Each group looked to be relatively the same in size with their own section for seating as well as tables at the front of each seating group.  The tables were reserved for individuals who needed to explain why they wouldn`t be able to participate and be given the opportunity to explain why.  Basically if your`e there on a Monday, you want to be able to get to explain why asap so you can be excused, if you are in fact excused.  For the remainder of those that do not have a reason they cannot participate it`s now a big waiting game.  Phil, who is an employee of the courts was there to explain in detail during first day orientation and give answers to common questions like how many days are you expected to be here, will you be paid, how is attendance taken etc.  Phil was a good speaker although his microphone needs to be either fixed or replaced.  He seemed to cut out a lot during the announcements he was making.    The waiting area seems rather cramped.  I`m over 6 feet tall and I found it at times difficult to sit in the rows of regular seating because the chairs weren`t spaced apart in such a way that you could get through easily enough to open chairs beyond where people were sitting in the rows.  I was in the blue section which is the most eastern part of the room.  This IMO was the best area because it`s close to the lockers, cafe door (it`s a cafe that accessible from the jury room) as well as closer to the rest rooms.  The blue section also had about 5 cubicles some of which has power outlets so naturally people with notebooks gravitated there for some personal space.  The tables at the front on the first day were reserved but after that they were no longer needed for individuals that need to explain their inability to participate so the tables became free game.    The tables was were I spent my second day.  I ended up playing euchre with 3 other individuals for almost 3 hours before we were eventually dismissed for the rest of the week.  Phil explained that there were 8 potential cases that would need jurors but for reasons he didn`t need to get into none of the cases required any of the jurors so essentially we were not only dismissed for the day but for the entire week we didn`t need to return either.    A couple takeaways for anybody that will have to go through this experience here:  - You will be needed for potentially up to 5 business days even if you are not selected to be in a jury assigned to a trial  - The first day you will need to appear for 8:30 am.  The following days (if necessary) require you to be there for 9:30 am.  - Lunch is for an hour and you are dismissed at 1:00 pm, expected back at 2:00 pm.  You must also check in for the afternoon session the same as when you arrive in the morning for attendance.  - Food and drink are allowed in the main jury room however not in the courtrooms.    - Wifi is provided however it doesn`t seem very reliable.    - You must be ready to be called at any time.  If you need to take a 10 to 15 minute break (smoke?) you must leave your summons with an officer so that they know you are there.    - You can exit from several other doors but only enter through the University Ave entrance where the security scans take place.  - If you require a statement of attendance (to prove to work you were there) when being dismissed and you are NOT selected to a trial, you must leave your summons with the court officers upon leaving the jury room. The court will mail your attendance record.  - Whether selected to a trial or not you will not have to be summoned back for 3 years.  You should keep your summons as prove that you attended jury pool previously.<15<2<2017<21<3<14

It seems to me that Scott is selling over priced insoles rather than fitting riders and bikes the way they should be.    I was not approaching this as a someone who had never been on a bike.  Having completed a dozen full distance Ironman events, I am quite familiar with what works for me and what doesn`t.  The fit that Scott left me with was absurd to say the least.  I ended up going home and starting from scratch, mounting my bike back on to the trainer and adjusting myself based on power and comfort.  Needless to say, I ended my season with a PB which was due to my 1/2 hour PB on the bike.  This was after taking apart Scott`s fit.  An over priced bad fit, I actually can handle.  My mistake was falling for it.  Putting items on me and telling me at the end how much they cost and that they are mine, that is terrible.  Save your money.  You want to go faster on the bike and be more comfortable?  Start with your bike shop.  Most of Toronto`s shops have more than competent fitters.  Scott was not even able to cut my stem to fit the bars in the right position.  He told me to take the bike back to my shop, have them do it, then bring it back to him.  Like that would ever happen.  You have been warned.<6<1<2019<16<54<38

We got our dishwasher checked because the water was clogged. The technician came and he literally just poked the dishwasher air gap and cleaned the dishwasher filter that I told him that I already cleaned. They charged us $120 for it. I had nothing replaced. I don`t think it`s a fair price. They could`ve just told me what was wrong with it and I could`ve done it myself and just pay for their trip charge which is $50-$80. The owner called me and offered us he could give us $50 off for the service next time. I appreciate the offer, but we will never use this company again after getting treated like this.<3<10<2019<16<13<15

DsjQhcaa4WzEJBpKvWi0vw<ToxCRiiL2hkDjx23cjNKFQ<iEXDmH5rp0TcRCmsASXtjw<1<6<0<0<"***BUYERS BEWARE***  I went to this store on Dec 29 to build my custom computer.  All my parts were handpicked and all I needed them to do is to source the parts and assemble the computer.  At the point of sale, the sales rep assured me that the build would be complete within one week despite the fact that the CPU I wanted was on back order.  One week passes and I called them to go pick up my computer and they told me that the CPU still hasn`t come in and I can expect to pick up the computer next week.  So I waited a week and called them back and they fed me the same story and told me that I can pick up the computer the following week.  Now three weeks later when I call them they told me that all the parts have arrived but I didn`t pay for the case so they didn`t do anything with the parts.  I am willing to take part blame for not inspecting the bill of sale to ensure that a case was on there.  But the worst part was that they didn`t even bother to call me to clarify.  They just sat around waiting for me to call them.  I informed them that I will pay for the case upon picking up my system.  They informed me that it would take a few days to assemble and test.  So I finally go to the store to pick up my system more than a month after purchase.  I was cautiously optimistic due to the lack of competence and professionalism.  While I was inspecting the system I discovered that the video card, motherboard and memory were not the same model I paid for.  In fact I was downgraded for the most part.  Earlier during this process the sales rep called me to inform me that due to availability they were going to provide me a different (but equally matched) model for my hard drive.  I found it odd that no such communication was delivered about the switching of my video card, motherboard and memory.    This was definitely shady business practices in my opinion.  My bill read '"Final Sale'" and I wasn`t about to let all my efforts in the past month go to waste so I did everything in my power to rectify this situation.  They tried to sell me a story about how my parts got mixed up with another build.  After a lot of back and forth they finally got my system built correctly for pick up on Feb 5th.  Just want to reiterate that I paid for my system on Dec 29th.  After reading this review if you still choose to do business with this establishment there are a few things you should know about the CONSUMERS PROTECTION ACT (https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/02c30):  ================================================================== 1.

I`ve had it for 2 birthdays and it`s just as good each time. Not too sweet and very fluffy. They have an assortment of cookies which are good, but I think the cake is where their strong point is. Be sure to order at least a week in advance for cakes as they can get really busy. Price is moderate depending on what you get. You can talk to a cake designer if you really need a specialty cake done like for weddings, themed birthdays, etc. Cakes by the slice is available too if you just want to treat yourself or you can just get the whole cake and eat it too.lol.

We decided to dine here for lunch on a Thursday morning. We came a bit after they opened. Surprisingly, there are already a lot of people seated! The seating weren`t as comfortable and really close together. We were seated next to another couple and basically watched them eat their burgers.   The menu offers a bunch of different items such as appetizers, soups, salads, and list of burgers to pick from. We ordered   *Farmhouse Burger 15 dublinar cheese, mangalitsa bacon, fried egg - My husband loves fried egg in burgers. This was juicy and really delicious.   *Crown Burger 15 aged mimolette cheese, arugula, fine herb aïoli, dried tomatoes - I ordered this as I love arugula and aioli. I cut in half but it was so good that I finished the half in three bites.  True Parmesan Fries 11 - Enough for sharing. I would not order individual fries. We finished about 4/5 of our fries. The aioli sauce that came with it was bomb. Definitely the fries to get if you are dining here.   Overall, the experience was very good. One of the better burgers we`ve had.<25<2<2018<23<17<9

The staff is super friendly, the flavors are always delicious, and you can taste the homemade ingredients.   I love the location in South End...but was so happy they opened up a second location closer to our home. It`s dangerous because I now crave it all the time, but I`d say it`s not a bad vice to have!   The dunkaroo ice cream it brings me back to my childhood and all things wholesome. Tasting like you just dipped vanilla cookies into the vanilla frosting and sprinkles, it`s a unique flavor that captures the hearts of all 90s kids.  I decided to go out on a limb and get the banana pudding and horchata flavors. Both were so creamy and delicious, while offering ample flavor. You can taste the freshness of each scoop.  My husband could live off the salted Oreo flavor. It`s not my personal favorite (I know, don`t judge), but he swears by it.<21<5<2019<14<53<52

_IkMd5e7Sm9aENSwpLOoiw<on1H_ts4hwSDBhJlZKvmgg<utIA0LyQmwP-9DRyxUe6qQ<4<0<0<0<I bookmarked this place previously based on the great reviews. I couldn`t wait to try it out since breakfast/brunch is my absolute favorite meal of the day! I understood that there would be a long wait since I went on a Sunday afternoon but I chose a beautiful day and immediately lucked up on a great parking spot...(don`t count on this however... parking lot was FULL)  I was told there would be a wait time of 1.5 hrs but the bar seating is up for grabs on a first come first serve basis. I felt like a stalker but I snagged a bar seat easily being solo on this occasion. The bar seating was cool as I was able to chat with the bartender and ask about menu item recommendations and their interesting assortment of brunch cocktails. The menu is seasonal so some selections are subject to change. I ordered the Egg white frittata which was very satisfying and healthy. Many menu selections are decadent and resemble desserts, so you can take your pick. I have since visited Snooze in Austin and Snooze @ Town & Country, Houston. All had great service but were inconsistent in the kitchen. So far Snooze, Montrose is still my favorite.  There is very good tasting free coffee while you wait.<10<1<2018<3<33<12
eNVlmj6E9OPIOtAVCm41hg<7wTmQIQh_5Wg6fhklAhdwQ<utIA0LyQmwP-9DRyxUe6qQ<3<3<0<0<I was very excited to try to place, but in all honesty was slightly disappointed. I attempted to come here 3 times, but the wait time was always over an hour long. Finally one day we got there around 9:30 am and was estimated a 30-45 minute wait and decided this was our time to tough it out. My absolute favorite brunch item is eggs Benedict and I get it at every restaurant and sadly this place wasn`t the best. It was good, but not worth a 45+ min wait to eat in a cramped space (at least a 2 top). My boyfriend got the pot pie breakfast and was underwhelmed, although flavorful. Definitely needed something else.  This place was good, but not really worth the hype in my opinion. Service was fine, but parking is sooooo inconvenient. I probably will not return here anytime soon, but will be at baby barnabys.<25<2<2017<19<59<47

We went on a saturday about 10am and there were tons of people waiting and there was an hour and a half wait.  The place was super cute and I could drink free coffee while I waited so that helped.   The pancakes were amazing and the eggs benedict was good.  It was worth the wait but I doubt I would go again if I have to wait an hour and half again<4<6<2017<15<33<55

Come into the store the 1/3 full store at 3 pm in the day.  Go find your own seat.  Want a menu?  Go back to the front to get it yourself.  Tea and cup gets slapped onto onto the table without any eye contact.  Order gets grabbed from my hand without a word or eye contact.    Owner deceitfully adds additional charge for debit card usage without informing the customer.  Card machine gets slapped down in front of me.  Both the owner and waitresses can`t be bothered to interact or even speak.   The result?  No tip.  It`s only then the lady owner has the audicity to speak with a heavy dose of attitude about why there is no tip.  All the issues were explained to her and she refuses to accept it and continues to be belligerent.  Sorry, lady, I don`t accept BS and strong arming, especially from people who don`t deserve it.  You want tips for your waitresses?  Tell them to stop emulating your terrible behaviour so they can earn it.  I`ve giving plenty of tips but they all earn it by a simple smile and and eye contact, you and your people managed to do even to do that.  I`m not the only reviewer here who has noticed that the owner has revolting behaviour and think they can bully customers.  Beware of this restaurant.<2<4<2016<23<27<36

I also enjoyed the fact they had several radios on display that you could actually get your hands on! Many of their handhelds were on display in a display case and it was easy to get a close look at those as well. I took advantage of the coupons sales visiting the store twice. Everything I needed was in stock and a few things I was unaware had been on sale as well.  Staff was very helpful and friendly and they answered all of my questions. The store was busy at times but they kept the flow going so there were no long wait times to purchase what I needed. I don`t live in this state, so the only bummer with purchasing from the store is the Arizona 8.6% tax! I thought my state was bad! Glad they take credit cards so at least I got some airline miles out of that add-on.   I`ve spent lots of money with HRO over the years and I`ve never had a bad experience, period. From crank-up towers to coaxial parts, it`s all been good. This was yet another positive experience and the reason I keep going to HRO first. It`s always fun to visit the stores and this one did not disappoint.<14<1<2019<23<24<18

Admissions are free during weekdays and even though they are closed on Mondays, some of the shops remain open and you can still hangout there, check out the decorations etc.The decorations are pretty nice, I loved the big Christmas tree.   It can get pretty crowded even during weekdays and be prepared to stand in line and wait at least an hour in most restaurants here.  There were plenty of little shops for gifts, food and games, although I felt that they could have more shops with Christmasy stuff.

I came to this rubios the first time and they gave me the wrong tacos and I ended up throwing them out because I didn`t want to drive back.I would normally try not to waste food but my girlfriend and I are lactose intolerant so we would have gotten sick eating them.  I decided to give them a second chance when we came back and my girlfriend and I ordered bowls. We asked for no chipotle sauce because it has milk in it. We asked when we got it and the receipt even said no chipotle. We couldn`t see the sauce when we looked In the bowl but when we got home we found the chipotle sauce under the fish. We decided to head back to rubios and the manager offered us a free meal next time we come in. She told us if she wasn`t there whoever was would honor it for us.  Today we came back in to rubios and the manager wasn`t there. We asked a supervisor and then she told us she could not do what the manager promised us. We left and decided to eat somewhere else.

Food is amazing (I normally order the spicy shanghai noodles along with the jai doo chicken wings) The noodles are just the right spiciness for me but can be looked at as being a bit on the hotter side for the average person. However, they do ask you what level of spiciness you want it at. The chicken wings are just your run of the mill fried wings and a bit on the smaller side but I think the price is worth it. Pricing is on the lower end for a decent amount of food which is always nice! I`ve never dined in but other than the furniture being a bit tacky and the plaza in which the restaurant is located being a bit old, nothing seems off about it. I`m VERY surprised at the fact that this place isn`t more of a hot spot. Try it out, you won`t be disappointed!<19<8<2016<14<16<6

When we got inside the menu had been changed which I certainly understand to keep it fresh and innovative.   I went ordered a Mexican salad as my entrée. My partner had a vegetarian platter. My salad was pretty to look at, but as I did again I found that many of the lettuce leaves are totally molding and the ingredients were Skimpy. The menu said my salad came with pepitas (I left the chorizo off). I practically had to dig to find them. There were a few cucumber slices and few halved cherry tomatoes, along with pickled onions. The dressing was flavorful to. However when I began to dig down into my salad there was literally dirt and grit on my teeth. The owner did not charge me, but my Tommy paid for the meal instead.   My partners dish was a variety of sweet potato and roasted vegetables in a scrumptious coconut sauce. She shared some. Very good but it became too sweet after a few bites for both of us. The kicker for me to you is do you have to pay nine dollars for a plate of chips, two salsas, and a small bowl of guacamole. Don`t get me wrong, all the salsas and guacamole were fresh and quite flavorful, But don`t most Mexican restaurants give you at least salsa and chips on the table... Just like other restaurants give you a basket of bread. Just saying...<10<11<2019<17<14<33

Spent alot of money and it was really disappointing.  I can`t think of 1 good comment on any dish besides the cajun alligator which I didn`t try. I ordered the special. Chilean sea bass. Tried to go healthy.  Its expensive fish that you almost can`t screw up. And they did. 40 bux a plate,  we had 2. Each piece was a different look shape and size. Small. Fine, I know its expensive.  We ordered 2 grilled. And they did 1 blackened,  fine we can try both.  They were both so dry. Amd tasteless. Which is hard to do with the oiliest fish you can buy. Another said their seafood fried combo wasnt good. I tried the calamari.  Average.  Tried my moms etouffee.  Average. I would not suggest this place to anyone. No excuse, they weren`t even busy.

cC0hK4r7U8KdNOy-dISGhg<EyYVD9n7PlYYLTSEQ5t14w<taSRrjQs0O7pnzd5oiQx7Q<4<7<3<5<Ramen Isshin opened up their newest location on Queen Street less than a month ago. It located on the south side of Queen Street, between Bathurst and Portland streets.  Our party of 3 came around 5:30pm on a Friday evening and we were seated right away. The restaurant has a long narrow layout with a couple of tables on either end of the restaurant but mainly bar type seating on the wall opposite the open kitchen. The washrooms are gender neutral and mouthwash and little plastic cups are provided. While it is less spacious at this location than the College/Bathurst restaurant, this venue is more modern. The front window is actually one of those garage type doors that can be opened up fully during nicer weather for an alfresco dining feel, but would be a colder place to sit during the winter due to little insulation.  The extensive ramen options include: red miso (spicy, mildly spicy and regular available), shoyu (available in kotteri (rich), assari (light), with roasted garlic oil, or tsukemen style), miso white sesame shio (option for regular or spicy), or black tan tan. Vegetarian versions are also available with options to replace noodles with vegan friendly rice noodles or kale noodles. They also offer rice based options such as chashu or karaage don. Prices range between $12 to $17 for ramen. Ice cream and mochi are available for dessert.  We started with the gyoza (deep fried and tasty) and karaage. The chicken was crispy and juicy. I ordered the Shoyu Tsukemen. Ramen Isshin is one of the few ramen places in the city that offers this style of dipping ramen. I enjoyed the thick chewy noodles it was served with as they stayed chewy despite dipping in the boiling hot soup. While not overtly salty initially, the saltiness of my soup became more evident towards the bottom of my bowl. Hubby ordered Spicy Red Miso. The miso broth was good and had a subtle sweetness that balanced out the mild heat of the spicy oil. Our friend ordered the Red Dragon Miso which was even spicier due to the bird`s eye chilies and spicy paste that accompanied the ramen.  The service was very attentive. We never had to ask for refills of water as the staff were quietly waiting nearby to pick up plates or refill water. There seemed to be several people opting to do takeout.  I will definitely return to try some of the other types of comforting ramen that Ramen Isshin offers.<2<11<2019<11<21<51

I can now tell you that TapeFace is one of the most creative, original and side-splitting full of laughter to the point of crying non-stop shows you MUST see.  TapeFace doesn`t speak, he has completely reinvented what a clown mixed with a mime would be with added coolness, bravado, and style the likes of which I haven`t seen in Vegas.  His show is largely, and I`m guessing 60%, audience participation.  He will pull people on stage and you just aren`t sure what you will see.

It was the second time in a month we have been there after not eating there for several years. No reason we haven`t, just have not gone. We had Excellent food. My reservation requested to sit by the fireplace and the overhead heaters in the enclosed patio. When we arrived, there was someone in that table and we were seated in a cold corner of the patio. A few minutes into our visit, the hostess offered to put some tables together in a better, warmer, spot and we moved. I appreciate what she did for us. It made our visit much nicer. The only thing that stops me from giving a five star rating is the parking. You`d think with the size of the lot that they have that parking would not be an issue on a Wednesday at 6:00, but we had to drive around twice and ended up finding a spot pretty far away in a lot behind the restaurant. Not much they can do about that. I recommend eating here.<12<12<2019<15<36<57

I had specifically asked for no housekeeping.  In my laptop bag was a bank envelope with $2200 cash in it. (Yeah I know it should have been in the safe)  At the airport, just before my flight, I noticed that the $2200 was gone!  From the airport, I called the Linq`s security and told them that my room had been entered and I was ripped off.  They REFUSED to even open a report on it and said that the only way they would even talk about it was if I came back in person... which I could not do. I said that they have a thief on staff and they should look at the surveillance/ hallway video`s at least and again they refused. I filed a police report online when I landed... but that will go no where.  The ironic thing is that a week or so later, my wife was talking to her Casino host at Harrah`s and told her the story of what happened to me... her exact words were...

Also, visiting is over a black and white monitor and phone, no more in person visits.  The ideal candidate for a job with the jail is highly insecure.  The MSCO remedies this insecurity by giving them a badge on their uniform and control over a small population of people who have already been stripped of any rights or privileges- basically powerless.  When you give sad people like that any kind of power, they automatically abuse it because they don`t get any respect in their pathetic real lives.  Unfortunately, when you visit someone in jail, you have to interact with these mental midgets.  I`ve been here to visit someone and they didn`t know if they could accept a passport as acceptable identification.  A group of them had to huddle together and weigh in on it before they decided a government issued identification was acceptable.  Another time I came, they said they couldn`t let me in because they couldn`t find me in their '"system'" which I thought was a good thing.  Most recently though, the Chaplin made a special arrangement for me to see my brother in person when our father passed away.  I didn`t ask, he offered.  On my way to the jail I prepared myself for some type of hullabaloo with the dum dums running the visitors station.  Sure enough, as soon as I told them the Chaplin sent me they informed me that the Chaplin doesn`t run the Maricopa county sheriffs office.  I reminded him that I never suggested anything as ridiculous as the Chaplin running the sheriffs office but merely that he called me and told me to come see my brother.  After about 20 minutes of talking as slow as possible to 5 different detention officers, I gave up and walked out.

Although there was only one other customer being seen I was told (once I got into the back room) that my wait would be over an hour. Interesting. Why wouldn`t y`all tell me that before I went back so I could make the decision on if I wanted to stay or not?   So I wait for a bit over an hour. And the doctor literally spent less than 3 minutes with me. He acted as though my pain was too minor for his attention. He was condescending and overall just unpleasant. He said he would prescribe ear drops but they were to expensive. I`m kinda thrown off because who is he to tell me what`s too expensive? Ya know? So I ask him how much is it and he pauses* rolls his eyes* than says '"I guess I can go look it up*...   Come on man. For real? Then he leaves the room and has me sitting there again. Comes back in 10 minutes and says it`s over $400 but if I`m going to be persistent he can just prescribe that rather than the eye drops he was going to prescribe. I tell him no it`s ok I`ll just take the cheaper prescription.  As I`m paying my $150 visit fee I ask them what protocol is if this treatment doesn`t work. They say with a straight face I`ll have to pay the $150 again to be re evaluated. Funny I didn`t get evaluated in the first place. I had a doctor walk in the room. Glance at me, make a smart remark and walk out.   And guess what. It`s been 2 weeks and I`m in even more pain than I was before.

So then I order a normal pizza for my daughter, he tells me the total, and I pull out a credit card. He says we don`t accept credit cards, I said oh ok.

This would have brought at least $50 at A Second Look before they closed down. You may as well take in a bunch of Forever 21 and Target, it doesn`t seem to matter.)"<6<12<2019<0<1<53

h9x3haEWF5uK4sO5zUpxmQ<k1MDSedmjtp7n889SHgU0g<NVIaU1w3e8KSeaGihSWicg<5<4<2<3<I only had a cheese burger and a beer, so hardly seems like I have enough to write a review with, but this seems to be a simple no-nonsense kind of place with a small menu board (on the wall above the window next to the bar and front entrance), so maybe I did get the gist of it.   One gentleman was bartending, nearly all of the bar stools were full, but none of the tables. The bartender was busy enough, yet I did not wait long to be greeted, and he was ready to take my order. I placed my order at the bar (as a sign on the wall directed) and went to a table.  The entire place looked clean and well-kept. I grabbed a table near the window and was amused by the collection of Pez dispensers under the glass. Each table had it`s own theme. The table to my left had baseballs and baseball bats under the glass.   The bartender brought my cheeseburger out after a few minutes and complimented my beer choice, Schlitz. It seemed like this was the kind of bar and bar crowd where I`d fit in better with a Schlitz. I read the room right, apparently.  The cheeseburger (with American cheese, as I requested) was served on small Styrofoam plate with a few pickle slices. It was simplicity at it`s best. The burger patty was somewhat thin but stuck out around the soft, yet toasted, burger bun. I loved every bite! My bill was $8.75 for a cheeseburger and a bottle of beer. This is my kind of place.  I can see myself coming back here again, and I recommend it.<19<2<2019<18<19<34

This was taken on 11/7 after I had received a complimentary guest card for this order (which was only because they royally messed the order before this one). As nice as it was for them to fix that last order, and they were, THIS is somehow even more insulting.  I finish my entree (spaghetti boglonase but in a lukewarm, watery sauce) and find this shortly into eating my salad. I ATE FROM THIS DISH. I can only assume it was intentional just because they couldn`t handle giving a complimentary meal, which again, only happened because THEY messed up, but this is honestly disgusting, inexcusable and laughable.  Don`t EVER waste your business with this joke of a restaurant, because their '"service'" looks like this.

We came in through the ER, seen fast, treated by a PA with an arm sling and ice pack. In and out in 30 minutes. We paid our ER copay & my insurance paid the Dr $900. Dr John R Green never even saw my husband but he billed $1500 for the treatment, which included a PA assessment. NO Xray or MRI. Dr Green is considered out of network for my insurance, but my insurance still paid $900. He won`t accept that as paid in full and balance billed us $600. Scottsdale Shea knows they have ER doctors that are deemed out of network but they wash their hands of the issue by saying our doctors bill separately.

Not only because we were spoiled like Xmas came early with delicious cocktails, wine, apps, entrees, desserts, and service, but because this place and its story are so special!  I have such a special place in my heart for Ireland! I went for the first time last year and it was incredible! The beauty, the history, the culture were all made especially prevalent by the amazing people! It`s no wonder the Emerald Isle aka Hibernia aka Éireann is known for its hospitality!  What made this experience and meal so fantastic was the genuineness behind the concept, the menu, and the space. I love so much that Murph shared the heritage of the namesake and that he has such talent behind it to make it spectacular with Chef on the food/menu & Greg on the wine & cocktails!  And, speaking of...the Synge Pear cocktail was so refreshing and delicious, it was dangerous because you could have 3 of them without even realizing! The apps were all spectacular! While I did LOVE the PEI Mussels & Cajun Prawns (those cauliflower grits were just wow!!), the Reuben egg rolls stole the show for me, but that`s just because I`m a Reuben fanatic! The WA Cab was superb! It was so smooth with all the right cab notes and paired exquisitely with the equally exquisite Coq au vin. Everything thing about this dish was done so well, I don`t even know where to start! The tenderness of the chicken, the sauce, the mushrooms and asparagus having the perfect texture, the whipped mashed potatoes were like velvet...and segueing into dessert with the absolute best Irish Coffee I`ve ever had accompanying creme brulee and chess pie that were just sublime, I could barely breathe I was so happily satiated in culinary bliss!  Tonight was like a trans-Atlantic trip to Ireland. The ambiance, Murph`s accent, the stories, the food, the merriment, and the coziness of it all has me aching for tiny pubs off one lane Irish country roads...  Thank you, as always to Nikki for always reminding us Queen City Yelpers why it`s so neat to be Elite! Thank you to the incredible staff (especially the gal who helped out table, her recs were spot on!).

Staying here will make an ardent atheist pray that this is true. You can even see it in the eyes of the employees. As friendly as they are, you can tell that nobody wants to be here.  The Rio is like being in 1986. By that I mean it`s like you were still driving your 1986 Ford Tempo 33 years later, held together with gaffer`s tape and surgical mesh, riding on the rusted rims. Vegas isn`t what it used to be, anyone who`s come here over the last two or three decades can attest. The Rio isn`t even what it was when they last updated their Expedia page.  You have more than too many options when it comes to finding a hotel in Vegas. What finally sold me on the Rio, aside from having regular decent stays here in the past, was this from Expedia.  '"Dining options include a seafood buffet, a Japanese restaurant and sushi bar, a wine cellar and tasting room, a New England-style seafood restaurant, an American grill, a South American café, an Indian restaurant, and room service.'"  There is no seafood buffet. It has long since been discontinued. As has the South American cafe. You find all this out piecemeal by asking everyone and anyone who has worked here long enough to remember. There used to be a Japanese restaurant. The folks at the American grille told me that it didn`t exist. It had in fact closed eons ago. Yet I kept passing signs across the casino floor saying Sushi at Club 172. When I would call the front desk, they were unaware of this place. After eating there, I kept asking any employee in any department where sushi could be found. Turns out this was a new sushi place and they rent the spot no differently than a nail salon in a strip mall. The property itself doesn`t know or care who may be in or out of business. They just gaze into an unknown future, waiting for the wrecking ball to swing.  There is a poster in the elevator for a celebrity host on a limited run at Chippendales`s. It was from last year. I wouldn`t doubt that they didn`t put it up until after he was long gone. The casino floor is littered with barkers outside of every shop or passageway, hustling everything from haircuts to time-share, like beggars who ask for investments rather than pocket change. The ATM fee is 9.99 to take out a twenty, onerous even by Las Vegas standards. Thankful, and rightfully, my hometown bank treated this charge as an illegal transaction and declined it.  On the first of my six days here, I called down with a litany of these complaints from the 1986 phone in the room. But I could barely hear the front desk because the phone was so old. That simply added one more complaint.  On the second night at midnight, my manager showed up drunk at my door like Oscar Madison from the Odd Couple after having a tiff with his galpal. I didn`t wake to his repeated calls and banging at my door (Thanks, Xanax!) so he simply slept like a homeless person outside of my suite in the hallway for almost six hours. Like so many piles of garbage or room service trays during my stay here, he wasn`t noticed or removed.  In defense of the Rio, the suite I stayed in was a full 1600 square feet that averaged less than 200 dollars a night, with a full view of the Strip. Despite the colors of beige-on-brown-on-cream - the vibrant spectrum that brings to mind Rio de Janeiro - and the highway salvage living room furniture that is currently spitting feathers from every tear and crack, it`s still a pretty decent price. So long as you avoid gambling. Go to a Station casino for that.  I won`t say how much I lost gambling here but I`d estimate that my Rewards/Players Club card paid me about one penny for every twenty bucks. I`ve gambled less at other casinos and been offered free rooms, my own private concierge and amenities too numerous to count. Here I got half-off a buffet.  The hallway reeks of cigarettes and now-legalized recreational weed. This is a positive. Penn & Teller, as well as The Comedy Cellar with Mark Cohen and Guests are also a bonus. Pet-friendly another plus.  Still, I give it one-star. Because who reads a two-star review? It`s just business."<12<2<2019<3<14<20

I tend to avoid looking at all the negative reviews as most times it turns out it is someone that had one bad experience then start to tick tack all the little things later. Most bad reviews here were based on moving out fees and carpet issues. Every apt I have ever moved out of charges carpet fees no matter what they look like and is a standard in the industry to replace after move out so I disregarded pretty much and kept it in my five   So back to my hunting...after a few emails and phone calls trying to set up a visit I never did get any return calls or emails responses which was pretty disappointing. Every other complex I contacted was pushing hard for me to come by so I actually did discard here as an option. During a March visit with other Apts (that contacted me back) I actually drove by here (I was down the street at another complex) and said what the hell so I just walked in. If they told me I needed an appointment I would of just walked. So I walked in and explained my situation and the lack of response. Miguel told me to wait and finished what he needed and took me on a immediate tour of the complex. I was impressed with the grounds and was glad Miguel treated me as important so that was a plus right there with me! Anyway after visiting the the other complexes that same day I came back and Miguel was still there. I wanted in and he explained to me what I needed to do and offered me the PC on site and started my reservation. My weekend was now free to explore as I was done hunting  Moving in was a breeze. As long as you pay full attention to all the details they need which I had it ready when I arrived (along with my paid fees and first months rent) my move in day took no more than 30 minutes  So after six months here I love it so far. Had three maintenance calls non emergency. Put the request in the morning by the time I got home it was done. I find the place quiet even with the many kids which was a worry for me as I like it quiet. Plenty of places for them to play on grounds and off so noise is a non issue and they are respectful. Something you AZ parents do right here...so congrats! At my old CA complex kids were horrible and no respect at all for other tenants which I blame parents in raising them with no respect to others  Only issue I have is with the Valet Garbage ($25 addition to rent). While nice feature you cant opt out. I get it because I`m sure you cannot monitor who is or who is not paying for the service. To easy to still just drop it out front and it get picked up which I`m sure non trusting people would take advantage of. They need look into lowering rates for the smaller apts though. I am in a 1 bed and just me and little trash and only use once a week. Little over $6 every time they pick up. That kind of sucks. Should drop it between $10-$12 as there is a size limit what you can put out so there is no way I can abuse it  Anyway after 6 months here a am liking it a lot here. 6 Months down the road I will do another update as it will be time to renew my lease. Will see what happens there  4 Stars is because of the Valet Garbage and the lack of response to my first initial contact. Other than that no real issues or concerns right now<23<8<2019<2<40<50

When we arrived in a Tuesday night it was busy which was nice to see. They currently don`t have any Happy Hour specials and something I hope they do add soon as it`s walkable and would be nice to stop and get a drink and app at the bar. I ordered the Cuban sandwich. It was good and I really liked their fries. My friend ordered the buffalo cauliflower appetizer and it was delicious. I know some people in the area still feel the price point is too high. I think for sandwiches they are on spot with other restaurants. Not sure though if it`s the price of entrees that have people discouraged or the fact they miss Dunnings which I never went to. I do however like the redesigned interior and will be going back!<10<12<2019<19<12<36

First thing, I read the prior reviews so made a reservation. Was late to said reservation but they were accommodating and had our table ready in minutes (note: it was packed! Make a reservation especially on a Friday or Saturday night if you want a table).  Second, the delicious aroma of their food hit us and made us even more excited to try this place, if that was even possible...  We ordered the family dinner for two - more than enough for two people and excellent. They brought out the panchan immediately and when requested later in our meal, they brought more.  Super friendly staff and the food came out quickly.  Reasonably priced for this high quality food.  I will definitely be back!  Extra bonus side note: there`s a Korean market attached to the building. Wished we`d gotten there early enough to check that out too.<19<1<2019<2<9<34
1_L_HsZredGxLu_TR5QyDw<cVrM2BvOvPV0Vi_rC8kepQ<uT1aIIhpRs4ivFGCC63-mw<2<16<5<5<"I see the pine cones that fall by the highway (The Talking Heads)  Didn`t see any pine cones, bit we did see a lot of trees and fallen trees, a river, a few canoeists, a few towns, a few Princesses, an eagles`s nest, and occasional patches of flowers and corn.  If you like riding on a train, I mean REALLY like riding on a train, you will love this three and a half hour train ride.  But if you pay your hard earned money to see the scenery of the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, you will be as severely disappointed as we were. Especially since their website says, and I quote, '"The train travels north-south through Cuyahoga Valley National Park'".    Trees, trees, trees, fallen trees, water, trees, trees, fallen trees, a town, trees, trees, water, trees. That`s about what we saw.  The train has three ticketing options -a luxury car with just 18 seats (with coffee and a muffin included), a mid priced section with tables for four, and a coach section. All seats are reserved.  You should know that no outside food or drink are allowed on the train, but they do have a snack bar. You can bring in a bottle of water, but that`s about all.  The CVSR has some nice promotions for the kids (Princess Parties and Superhero Excursions so you can get a double usage from those Halloween costumes, and they also have a cool Ale on the Rails beer tasting ride for the adults.  But if you think this train ride is like taking a monorail through a zoo or amusement park to see the sights, well, the CVSR will disappoint you too.   It`s a relaxing ride, which combined with the lackluster scenery will put you to sleep, like it did to me. Literally."<15<7<2019<11<24<39

I have never before had anyone care so much about my cat (Buffy) and me.  They have shown so much kindness and compassion to both of us.  A little history - Buffy is almost 18 years old and has Kidney Disease.  I used to see Dr. Rosado at a different clinic but when she left there, the clinic told me they did not know where she went.  Well, Buffy was not doing well this past March and I didn`t trust her care to that clinic now that Dr. Rosado had left.  With a little bit of searching, I was able to find Dr. Rosado at Market Street Pet Hospital.  I called her and she saw Buffy the same day and I swear she saved Buffy`s life.  It`s now December and Buffy is thriving under Dr. Rosado`s and Cierra`s care.  Trust me when I say that if you want the best care for your animal, you should go to Market Street Pet Hospital.  I honestly don`t believe that Buffy would be alive today had I not gone there.  The entire staff is incredibly nice and helpful.  You won`t regret entrusting your pet`s care to them!!<13<12<2019<3<0<58

Of course, we are the typical consumers. We wanted a cheap, decent bed for a good deal. Gary was knowledgable and we ended up NOT getting a cheap, decent bed. We bought a bed we DESERVED. We invested in a plush king mattress, mattress cover and upgraded to the adjustable top/bottom frame with wireless remote. Gary was right. Beds are an investment but if you look at it as investing in YOURSELVES, and promoting overall well being, it will be easier to make a big purchase.

V9Gu0aSR7BJHHpjmXGMOSg<0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w<ctTvGR0IujZknvD3ERvdSA<4<17<8<15<"Mystic Falls Park is a special place where imagination puts on a stellar performance. The headliners of this spectacular are a menagerie of robotic animals and water.      If Sam`s Town is the Wild West, Mystic Falls Park is the bucolic pioneer West. Under a ten story conservatory of natural light, Mystic Falls Park is a Disneyesque parkscape of trickling streams, cascading waterfalls, windy walking paths bordered by Pioneer style lamp posts, live foilage, chirping birds, a howling wolf, and imagination creating an escape from the wild west of today`s Las Vegas. Essentially Mystic Falls Park makes the property a Sam`s & Disney Town.      It doesn`t take much imagination to realize that first-rate public places attract people into the property. It is the Disneyesque Mystic Falls Park that leads me into Sam`s Town. I regard it as one of my top casino public areas that also include the Silverton and Bellagio Conservatory.       I enjoy picking up a cup of coffee from the Sam`s Town Dunkin Donuts then drinking it while appreciating this indoor nature wonderland. On my walk through the indoor forest I benefit from the soratorium that the sun produces from the skylights 10 floors above. At night time the pioneer themed street lamps create a nighttime walk in the woods feel. On my walk along the lush bordered walking path, I take in an imaginative display of nature. In the trickling stream, a beaver is chopping away. Deeper into the forest a deer lives below a mountain of two big horn sheep under the American flag. As I round the corner, I see that the two bighorn sheep are standing over the bar that is caved into the man made mountain. Across from the bighorn  sheep, the walk leads to a towering waterfall splashing from a colossal man made mountain. The summit of this mountain is full of life. There is an eagle, wolf, and bear.      The automatic animals above the waterfall are also entertainers when they headline the complimentary Sunset Stampede Laser Light Show at 2 pm, 4 pm, 6 pm, 8 pm, and 10 pm. This is a state-of-the-art laser light show where towering water dances to the cinematography of a wolf, bear, and eagle in an Old West storyline. From my experience, the prime viewing spot is the tables at the bar facing the plants that prevent tall spectators from blocking the view.     It is during the Christmas and Holidays season, where imagination deserves a standing ovation. From November 27 into the New Year, Mystic Falls Park turns into an indoor Winter Wonderland. This is a must see during December. Thousands of Christmas lights adorn the Christmas Wonderland parkscape. There is even snow falling intermittently from the skylights. The trickling stream is bordered by realistic snow. Joining the menagerie of robotic animals are polar bears. The zenith of the Winter Wonderland experience is the Christmas and Holidays edition of the laser light show. This 15 minute spectacular is lightning in a jar that shines the Joy of the season. My favorite scene is the bear singing along to Elvis Presley`s '"Blue Christmas.'"        Finally, Mystic Falls Park is a gateway to Sam`s Town`s dining. Within earshot of the howling wolf and roaring bear, there are a handful of restaurants. Bordering the park is Fireside Buffet, a Steak house and Mexican restaurant with tables overlooking the scenery. If the wolf and bear were real, they probably wouldn`t eat humans because on the far side of their man made mountain is a food court featuring Panda Express and McDonald`s. If they didn`t like those two, nearby is Subway, T. G. I Fridays, Dunkin Donuts, and so on.       In conclusion, I wish there were more attractions of this caliber in Las Vegas. Mystic Falls Park is up there with my favorite top casino public areas. This is a stage where Imagination puts on a stellar show that I rate 4 Stars."<4<2<2016<7<53<55

We belatedly saw that the price was $37, which seems crazy high for the service provided. But we`d already signed up. Then, at the end of the manicure, we were told it was $52. Because the price was actually    '"$37+'".  Which apparently means $37 for someone just out of cosmetology school, and higher for the staff that we got. This was never explained at the front desk, and we were clearly not regulars. We did not get any kind of superior service for the extra money--basic filing, trimming and polish.

While festivals like Great Vegas  Beer Festival, Brews Best, and Downtown Beer Festival pull premium vendors, breweries, and entertainment----Rockstar Beer Festival prides itself on mediocrity.  It`s a overpriced frat party or Vegas Pool Club party. It`s more of a party to be '"seen'" rather than drink craft beer at.   While they may pull a few local craft brewers, they really don`t strive to pull anything else spectacular. Majority of the beers are your macro micros. The beer vendors in town such as Johnson Brothers, Southern, Nevada Beverage, and Bonanza tend to bring out the bottom of their portfolios. When you go to other festivals in Las Vegas, these vendors bring out beers you haven`t heard of nor tasted. When you go to Rockstar Beer Festival (or any of the similar beer tastings the promoter does), you get Shocktop and Blue Moon!!!  The venue also is pretty bad as its too small. You would think with as few beer tents that they have that there would be plenty of room but there really isn`t."<20<10<2013<23<19<39

We ordered 4 dim sum items in total, and I think they kept forgetting about our order. We waited at least 30 mins and asked the servers 3 times to finally have 3 of the dishes served.

So..The first time I went I showed them pictures of the style of haircut I wanted for my baby pom which was a lion shape and when I came to pick Bear up he was Literally shaved like a naked rat and had cut marks in his skin under his arm and had a bloody nail. I was HORRIFIED! Nobody even called or texted me to let me know they had done that to my dog..wtf Anyone that knows anything about pomeranians knows they get extremely puffy and it`s very unhealthy for them to be that bare. I was so pissed so I asked them why they went that short, especially without even asking me? They said he had a matt in his fur...Like are you serious??? Of course he does, he`s a pomeranian!! They`re so lazy and incompetent they can`t even take the time to brush the mattes out..That is your job right? So I was already furious and went to check out and then they start telling me all these extra charges that I owe which they NEVER once communicated with me before as we had already agreed on a set price.  At this point I was just over it and wanted to leave with my poor puppy whimpering in pain. Apparently you can only pay using a card, so I did and then they literally have the computer rigged because it doesn`t even show the price of tip.. it just asks how well the service was and you click a box, so you don`t even know how much you`re tipping which I assure you is WAY more then the average person would ever tip, and I am a Very good tipper. I`m the kind of person that tips $100 if you do a good job, follow instructions, and most importantly do Not Ever Fuc$%ing harm my animal or do anything to him without my consent.

ESGGMhMymdvhCMKMqL7qqA<HSBD-DVZuybsENgfyB4COg<3tt-ZYVK1lRrHaFx40VsMA<2<0<0<0<Your Sunday outside bartenders around 4pm looked super hung over. I sat down by myself at the bar and it took someone several min to even come up and take a drink order. Then I had to flag them down to take a food order. For the record, the first girl in red with long dark hair and glasses was actually nice. She even told me her name (which I forget now). But she must have been leaving for the day because I never saw her again. Then I had to flag someone down to get a drink refill. No one asked how my food was and no one ever cleared the empty water cups next to me or washed the bar top off when I sat down. That said, they had no problem serving your other servers and bartenders who sat down next to me after they got off their shifts. I looked around the bar and there were several customers with empty drinks. You need better bartenders. There is no reason on a day this slow people should be sitting here with empty drinks. I was sitting near the SE corner of the outside bar in a mesh black and grey hoodie. Feel free to check your cameras and see what I am talking about. I was in the industry for 20 years. These girls are not making you money!!! The one in the white shirt was MUCH better than the one in red. (This was a new girl in red, long dark hair and no glasses). She was clearly hung over and looked disgusted to be at work. Constantly texting and kept pounding water. For the record, the food was good. But disappointed in the lack of service. I realize I am just one person but I am a excellent tipper. I know how hard service staff works....I always tip 30% for good service. If the experience ends better I will update this post. But the last hour and 1/2 has been not good.   Continued: a guy came up from his patio table and stood next to the service well for several min as the girl in red stood there and talked to staff who was off-duty sitting on the NE corner of the bar. The guy waiting for service looked at me and shrugged his shoulders and laughed at the hilarious ness of the situation. I told him this has been my night too. Being ignored.   Finally after another hour it started to get a little more busy in the bar. And clearly girl in red must have felt less hung over...she finally started to crack a smile and be more attentive. She actually asked me if I wanted another drink before having to flag her down.   I have been to your chandler location. The staff has always been attentive and friendly. I realize Sunday`s are rough - a lot of staff goes out on Saturday and parties. We did it al the time when I was in the industry. But we also came in, put on a happy face and busted our butts.   I hope the staff can get it together. Like I said, I feel bad for the bar managers and owners. Customers drinks should be full and no one (on a slow night like this) should have to get up and ask for refills.   I will come back again and give it a second chance. But chandler might be my home location.<11<11<2019<0<4<20

At Cibo, the art of Italian cuisine is not measured by the nuances of cooking, but by the love of food and the immaculate bond of family and heritage.  This place is owned and operated by an Italian-American family who adhere to high standards of quality and culinary integrity, making everything from the cavatelli to the bread from scratch and baking their pizzas in a old world brick oven that fires up to a temperature in the 800-900 degree range!  I`ve been coming here for quite some time, so this review is long overdue.  Typically, I order the wheat cavatelli with broccoli and a side of bread, which is artisan style and crispy around the edges, while warm and soft in the middle. The portion sizes are moderate and just enough to satisfy you, without leaving you stuffed.  The pizza, which I get occasionally, is Neapolitan style and is simply delicious on every level!   Everything is prepared in full view of the dining area, while the pizza oven is in the back.  I have never encountered any problems whatsoever with the service as they have always been pleasant and cordial.  So, for those who have made absurd claims as to their bad experiences with the service, I can affirmatively refute such unfounded delusions as they are likely the result of insatiable demands from people with obvious entitlement issues.  Cibo is about as good as you`ll get in terms of Italian cuisine - no gimmicks, just excellent food!<1<10<2018<17<59<30

Our servers were fantastic with the service and checking back on us.  This turned into a 2+ hour session of drinking, eating, catching up and celebrating.  The Kyara staff were great.  I sampled so many dishes through the night, here`s what I remember.... Takoyaki - prepped perfectly and flavorful. Very good Mini-Udon - fresh noodles, great broth and the perfect size to keep sampling other dishes. Cheese Corn - my go to Izakaya side dish and I enjoyed Kyara`s Tempura - Shrimp and veggie tempura were on point Salmon bowl - Fresh and served with rice Kurobata Sausage - served on onions and this was the first time I`ve had this dish.  Savory and a great dish to pair with sake and beers Chicken & Beef Skewers and dishes - We ordered so many that I lost track of the names, but all were lovely and delish.  Can`t go wrong here. Mackerel - Yummy, fresh and tasty.  The Izakaya menu here is extensive.  There`s so many great dishes to sample and the sake and drink specials after 10 PM are fantastic.

I had to go in on a weekly basis to re-sign my contract. Over the weekend my drivers licences was unfortunately misplaced and I was not able to go to the DMV yet to replace it as i work another full time job. Today i returned to hertz to re-sign my contract and at the very end the guy asked for my ID, when i explained what happend and how I was planning on getting it replaced tomorrow, they terminated my contract.   Here is where is gets bad.. I didnt use the rental for anything but giving rides with lyft. So today i got a ride to the rental company. Once i told that to the man working there he told me i have to bring the car back today. So i said '"ok, i grabbed the keys and left to go get the car. Shortly after they called me to tell me that if don`t come back with the car in 30 minutes they will be filing police charges for stealing. After explaing that i live in Henderson and there was no way for me to drive across town and back in 30 minutes, i was told to bring back the keys and they would pick it up with an extra $50 tacked on to what Im already being charged.   Never ONCE did these employees review the strict rules and poilicies with me for the lyft program. I was totally unperpaired and blinded sided when this company turned on me and started treating me like i was a criminal. The mamanger Mike was being completely unreasonable and only cared about his property and i am left carless and now jobless with no remorse. And being double charged, for nothing!  To add insult to injury. He told me that when they come pick up the vehicle, they will not bother to let me know so that i may get my belongings out. If i am not outside waiting for them to show up (no guaranteed time of arrival was given) they will take the car with my personal belongings.   Possibly  the worst professional exeprience i have ever had the mispleasure of going through. If you use the lyft rental program , watch your back. They will turn on you instantly.

During the time I was here the door constantly was open with patrons coming in and out.  The staff is incredibly friendly, and accommodating. The owner, a Baltimore native that moved here about six years ago, personally touched every table and insured guest satisfaction with the food.

There is something royally wrong with their laser machines and company culture. The machines regularly break down resulting in appointment cancellations.  After two years and barely any reduction in hair, I think they are repaired just enough to make a familiar noise. I experienced better results after just one treatment at another place than two years of treatments at Simplicity. Low grade, poorly trained  in customer service staff, can be openly rude, same attitude comes from the location management.<29<8<2019<2<24<16
h6axsscn2N_ASdnqIz5AIA<P5Xmi0JUMSorpi1S1TM0qQ<ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA<4<4<0<1<"I probably did it wrong because I visited Copper before Passage to India. It`s hard to compare the two when it comes to atmosphere and general feel. That said, Passage has solid, delicious Indian food that definitely satisfies a craving.   I came here on a Saturday evening around 4pm for a very late '"lunch'". Boyfriend and I were seated quickly and service was friendly and welcoming. The atmosphere is...bland. Its a small restaurant with only a handful of tables, and the decor is limited. Luckily, we weren`t there for the environmental aesthetic - we were there for some garam masala and curry!  I ordered the chicken tikka masala because I know what I like and not much else. The boyfriend is always more adventurous and got some type of goat dish. Our food came out quickly and looked fantastic. My meal was delicious and I heard that the goat was, as well.  I didn`t eat any of the naan, but I could tell from a glance that it was probably not on the same caliber as what we got at Copper. It looked like frozen naan that you could buy at the grocery store. My boyfriend said that it was fine and did the job, but certainly did not taste homemade.   Overall, I`m thrilled to have another solid Indian option in a neighborhood that I frequent. Passage to India is no-frills, inexpensive, hot, fresh Indian cuisine, and that`s all we were looking for!"<17<7<2019<15<48<16

The empanadas were probably one of the BEST empanadas I`ve ever had. I do have some negative feedback and that was that our waiter, unfortunately, was not very attentive and we wound of waiting for a really long time for him to come back and check in on us. My sister and cousin were waiting for water refills and did not get them until after we had already finished our meal. We asked for our check and waited a while for the waiter to come back and he had forgotten it. Each time we had to get his attention. I will definitely eat the food again but not really sure if I would dine in again.<10<12<2019<22<16<36

This year same ordeal but I`m not sure if he was the same guy this time. Scored some really good items for the low and definitely look forward to hitting this place up again to find some awesome items. If you love the 90s this is a great place to come and reminisce.

I found Kelly through yelp and his 5 star ratings. Located at the very end of small strip mall next to an indian restaurant, don`t be deterred by the location!  My friend and I walked in for piercings in the evening and Kelly was able to accommodate us as walk-ins. We each got one earlobe piercing and we couldn`t be happier with the outcome! I was very picky about the location and Kelly was kind and patient even when I switched the piercing spot multiple times. His prices are very reasonable, cheaper than most of the piercing artists around town.  Overall, quick and easy process! At the end he gave us after care instructions. He even gave us some tips to care for for our other piercing that had developed a keloid!   Be sure to bring cash! I think they have charge extra for card. Thanks again Kelly!<11<12<2019<4<26<32

For example equality for all people, divorce,  addictions and much more. It`s important as a community to be able to relate and talk about issues that are common in the world. He speaks from his heart, is educated and doesn`t discriminate or push the church to have views about certain things. As a church the focus is about family,  real life and topics that we can actually take home and utilize the skills they teach us about. It`s really nice to call this church my home and I love to invite people because I`m not only a proud believer of Jesus but I believe in my church as well.<22<5<2014<12<0<17

We decided we`d try NBN and it was great! I had the Pad Thai and while it wasn`t spicy it was still really good! The chicken tasted good and the portion sizes are huge. We liked it so much we went here twice in a week. If the pad Thai isn`t spicy enough just throw some hot sauce on it and it`s perfect.

Service was friendly but I was confused as to how servers were assigned tables. There were five tables on the patio and each of us had different servers. Also it is difficult to see out on the patio from the inside. I believe this may have led to my server forgetting about me a couple of times.   Server recommended the cinnamon roll pancakes.

I got to try 4 because a friend and I tried the Benny Duo. The most traditional was the Ham version and that was quite good. The more Mexican inspired versions- Chilaquiles and Ranchero- were good, but I wasn`t a fan of the soggy tortilla layers. Perhaps it just wasn`t what I expected. The Bella Bella really didn`t need the balsamic glaze. I ate all of them and enjoyed them, but I cannot say I`ll be running back for more. The HASH BROWNS, now that is a different story.

OJDsfVPOBfxubitWr81VMg<t2-wvybevFcdX7WuoIz8PA<utIA0LyQmwP-9DRyxUe6qQ<4<1<0<0<"I`m bestowing the honor and prestige of my 100th review to my favorite meal, brunch.  Ha.  But seriously.  Summary: I think Houston is lacking in brunch places that have unique brunch foods, so I`m so glad Snooze has been added to the mix.  They have lots of unique pancake and French toast flavors and several different versions of Eggs Benedict.  And they have a pancake of the day as well as seasonal flavors, so there is always a chance of trying something new.  PLUS, you can even get a pancake sampler platter (3 pancakes) or an eggs Benedict sampler (2 different types), which is perfect for '"I want to try everything on this menu'" people like me!  The pancakes on the sampler platter were described as 4 inches, but they looked a lot bigger to me (tons of food)!  Our service was great (thanks Carolitos!), especially considering that we were a group of 11.  Do be prepared for a wait, at least on a Saturday morning.  Groups of 2-4 who were putting their names down around 11am on Saturday had a 1.5-hour wait time (but nobody seemed to care)!  You cannot make reservations via phone; you can only get your name on the list in person.  The details:  I came with a group of about a dozen people for the first part of a progressive bridal shower, and our server Carlitos was attentive, described the entire menu to us because none of us had ever been there before, offered to split our check - that alone would have impressed me because I usually expect it either (1) not to be possible or (2) to involve obvious reluctance on the part of the staff BUT that definitely was not the case - and even brought out complimentary pumpkin pancake since we were celebrating a bridal shower.  It`s possible to come here in a larger group, but I wouldn`t recommend it.  This is in part because I received some mixed messages about whether making reservations was possible when I called a month in advance (when they told me I just needed to call closer to the date) and then later, two weeks in advance (when I was told I could only make an in-person reservation).  However, Snooze does text you when your table is ready, so that is helpful if you want to run an errand and come back instead of standing around.  Because of the mixed messaging, I thought going into brunch that this would be a 3 star review or less, but the friendliness of the staff and the service we received while we were there pretty much redeemed them.  Food was good, and I intend to check out that pancake sampler when I come back to try some new flavors!"<16<10<2016<16<50<29

After an hour wait (I`m starving at this point), I open the bag & I received everything but the noodles! Called the delivery guy back & he was kind enough to bring the noodles back which took an additional 30 minutes. The noodle portion was the smallest I`ve ever seen & the quality of the beef was poor. Save your money don`t bother with this place!    Update** Decided to give this place another shot & dine in. I`m really glad I did, the place is small, quiet & has an intimate setting. My boyfriend & I started with Tom Kah with tofu, it was very flavorful we loved it! My boyfriend ordered the Sea Curry with brown rice, it so freaking good!!!

GP_sW40X2XZ3WSqXGAbiGQ<6Rkg-RdO9-EhDP9bbBiKZA<zHNk2BnANwkvHvaXD7yYsg<5<3<0<0<Solid 4.5! Great service. Great prices! Good portions! Great selection of food for different eaters and diets. Totally something new from what we are used to. Service was impeccable!  Te means tea. From the outside, the sign almost made the name of this restaurant seemed like it was Tie, instead. This restaurant gives off a modern fusion Korean-Canadian tea house vibe or at least that is what they are trying to accomplish.  Plans kept changing for today and somehow we ended choosing to go to Funhouse for something `romantic` and Halloween themed, but without leaving the city or breaking the bank either.  I asked my beau to pick a place and he did justice of a fine pick if I have to say! Very impressed with everything to be honest.  Location: 4/5   Pretty West for me, but West Queen West is super hip and trendy. There are plenty of street and paid G parking lots nearby. There are a lot of little shops and the Trinity Bell Park to stroll through as well.  Decor/Ambience: 5/5  We hit the jackpot! Groovy music playing in the background Sunday evening and we pretty much had the entire place to ourselves! Retro incandescent lights on the walls and they pretty much play Sailor Moon on repeat on 2 screens on either side of the bar! My beau and I love Sailor Moon, so when we were not talking or eating, we were busy reminiscing our childhood and getting excited over Sailor Moon and her friends transformation sequence!!  Food quality: 5/5  The menu is so shareable, dietary-friendly, two page selections of Korean-Canadian fusion food!!  The veggie dumplings came in 6 and just hit the spot as a starter.  The unadulterated ssam (lettuce wraps) with shiitake mushroom had some kick to it and it was refreshingly light and springy.  My fish and taro chips with kimchi on the side was AMAZING! Very light batter, not fattening or drenched in oil. Fish was not deeply fried, but still tasted surprisingly fresh! Never thought of using taro chips! Seem like a much healthier options than the usual fries!  My beau thought that the bulgogi sliders were done well. Nice starter for meat eaters. The quail eggs added creatively new dimension.  The bibimbap had purple rice and nothing was sticking to the bottom of the pot, so no waste at all! They gave us different sauces to add more flavours on the side.  Service: 5/5  One of the best service, I have had in the longest time, main reason why I am writing this review right after we paid for our dinner service. The server welcomed us with a big smile and warmth, read my special needs or notes on OpenTable, promptly seated us, and immediately asked which one of us was the one with dietary restrictions. Then she proceeded to recommend all these wonderful options just I had asked for in my notes and she went into detail about ingredients and possible alterations if needed. She engaged in conversation with us throughout our dinner and always had first if she can enter `our` space or wait to ask if she could interrupt and clear our table instead of just assuming. We both felt well attended to.  Value: 4.5/5  Dinner date here for 2 with 5 items came out to only $80 after tips and tax, so it is one of our more affordable monthly anniversary locations. We were both relatively full at the end; just the perfectly amount of fullness in our tummies.  Overall: solid 4.5!  I thought that this place would be more popular or busier on a Sunday evening, but it worked out in our favour of having a tranquil dinner service. Gave us this extra intimate setting being practically alone except for the staff members here. Would definitely come back when I am in the neighbourhood again, but knowing me, I mostly would try new places first before coming back anytime soon. So happy that my beau paid for the bill, too, this time. Definitely one of his better choices for restaurants!!<27<10<2019<23<50<32

I was overwhelmed by her midriff at the level of my straw.  I don`t know her name, but she looks like an Alley, and I found that she wanted to nickel and dime me over some simple vegetables. The policy is that you can substitute the pita for cucumber, on a hummus entree. She insisted on a $2 charge. I told her I have been visiting a pita jungle longer than you have been working there, and I said it in a nice way, and she insisted on the upcharge. Little did she know her tip would be shorted by $2 for her rude ttitude and random policies that she pulled out of her barely cover ass.  I also took off an extra dollar offnher tip because her midriff was glaring in my face the whole meal.   Don`t get me wrong I enjoy an occasion evening at the skin club, but I don`t need a midriff showing when I`m eating hummus with family. Please least tell this lady how the policy works.

It is also clean and has a decent selection.  Overall, it is an pretty average grocery store.  The biggest problem with Dave`s is that basically everything is overpriced.  Shopping here seems to add 10% on top of what I would expect to pay for my groceries, which isn`t ok with me.  The produce in particular is a bit out of control.  I`m not paying 5x more than I`m used to for peppers and limes in particular.  Also, if you come here during a busy time, be prepared to stand in line for the rest of your life.  If this place wasn`t close, I wouldn`t go here.  It reminds me of Safeway, which I never went to when I lived in Denver for the same reasons.<1<9<2012<18<47<51
qSVgyhH-1Tbh7gxE9DUuTg<dPpEYTNvTVg7YhkDlUVglw<hRK876bEBdPYAJKbg6pCEw<1<0<0<0<We`ve stayed at the Princess for five years as our staycation destination. We even had a tennis membership when the courts were there. Tried to stay the weekend of Fathers day. We paid $389 for our room. When we arrived we found that there were no towels at the pools (all were dirty), no where to sit (they had offered an $89 Groupon without informing us when we paid our $389), restaurants were all reserved, cabanas were all reserved, servers were hiding in the shade not serving drinks, gates were all zip tied because they did not have the staff to man the gates, valet was a 20 min wait. Not the service you expect when paying a higher price for a resort.  We left after only 3 hours of staying as there was no room to move! Front desk said we could have stayed that night for free when checking out. Not offering a future day when service would resume as normal. However, why would we want to stay that night when there was not one seat, at any of the 5 pools! Or any night they offer a Groupon for the masses. I sent two emails informing them of our exhausting experience with NO response. We were not asking for a free room, but acknowledgment would have been appreciated.    We have found another high end resort where we stay at all future staycations. Make sure to ask if they have a Groupon out before booking here!<6<8<2016<18<19<20

It is a HUGE waste of money and they will continually charge you for every little thing. Then wait until you try and use it. My cousin passed away and I decided to try again to stay for the weekend and they said I owe money, but I am paid I full and I told them we owe nothing. So now including maintenance fees and the money you pay to roll over your points each year we are into this for over $13,000 and I cannot get a room for 3 days. Their accounting department is awful.   DO NOT BUY!!  Where I do appreciate the reply, I want you to know i have paid over 13,000 and have never been able to use this. My cousin died and I have rented an airBnB in Vegas to attend his funeral next Saturday. When I asked to speak to a supervisor I was sent to a voicemail. No compassion.

The chlorophyll water is impressive in how much energy you can feel, literally within a few minutes of imbibing. And the Date-Almond Milk drink will have you smacking your lips for more. The other, less fabulous, more healthy drinks, such as beet, green veggies, carrot, etc are also pure, bright, and fresh. You can order a set of juices for a 1-day, 3-day, or 5- or 7-day juice cleanse or fast. These are quite expensive, amounting to around $25-45 a day.  The store offers a membership that reduces the cost.  The reason for docking stars is the service. I have never been treated with exemplary customer service here. The clerk one time ignored me, and asking questions about things was like pulling teeth. Another time, different clerk, I had to practically beg for one of the juice fast groupings, for some reason. He kept avoiding bringing out what I wanted and asked for. Weird. Eventually it got sorted. But 3 out of 3 times here there has been some lack in communication or courtesy.

Don`t mind me; I`m just listing parks and trails that have one thing Cholla Trail does not have -- bathrooms.  I get dehydrated easily, so I always have a water bottle on hand, wherever I may be. Results are predictably regular with trips to the restroom. This morning, though, I planned carefully and relieved my bladder before we made the drive to the residential neighborhood outside Cholla Trail. Unfortunately, my efforts were insufficient. By the time we hit the trailhead, my kidneys decided it was time to route more product for disposal.   What a shame! Had there been an outhouse, port-o-potty, or collection of trees that needed watering, I would have absolutely been equipped and ready to gain good ground. It was, of all things, my bladder that prevented the full realization of this marvelous hike. A pathetic 2,400 steps in, and we had to turn around.   Naturally I will not blame my own physiology and condemn Paradise Valley for not creating luxurious bathrooms for hikers and bourgie visitors alike. I mean, come on. Some of us are traveling from a good distance -- I suppose you`d best get creative on mapping out some public establishments nearby before parking.  That being said, here are some positives:   It`s obviously a beautiful trail. I love the uphill climb. This isn`t some easy, paved road; you do need some preparation to take on Cholla Trail. The surrounding area is speckled with beautiful homes, some of which are still being constructed. For every vantage point, you are guaranteed exquisite, panoramic views of the Valley. Also, you might be lucky to see some wildlife; we saw (and heard) some quails scurrying about.   There is much to enjoy about this trail, and I`m glad to have at least gotten a preview of its challenges and rewards. However, until I am fitted for a catheter, I won`t be back!<30<11<2019<17<52<55

They did so but they were price wise a little higher than some other companies. They sold us on their availability and customer service. Granted we have to pay a yearly renewal fee, but that includes service anytime we have issues. Anytime I call to let them know we have issues and need help, they tell me at least a 3 week wait. Its been like this for 4 years, and they always tell me '"its termite season'". But it doesn`t matter what time of year I call. This last call I made it was 3 weeks out from the time I called. They came and treated the area and a week later we had another issue in another area, and I called and it`s more than a month out until they can come out. Clearly they have a resourcing issue and DO NOT care about their customers.   I would not recommend this place if you want things taken care of in a timely manner. They are truly Awful   *****UPDATE *****  After my review on yelp, someone reached out to me quite quickly from Burn`s. I will say I felt That they genuinely cared about my concerns and wanted to address them quickly. They had an inspector come out assess the property and give us a treatment plan so that way hopefully we can take care of the issue. In addition they were able to move my appointment up so we didn`t have to wait the 4 weeks for a service appointment.   This is why I changed my rating from 1 to 4 stars.   I hope that they can continue down this route and provide this level of service going forward.   My only feedback is to have them train the staff who answers the appointment calls what to recommend for services. As I was talking with the inspector, he advised me that if I had many issues I could have inspector come out before the service appointments to make sure we have a more I depth treatment plan.

I`ll be sure to avoid it and order Dominoes (or others similar) instead in the future.   Buffet: food items were cold, not refilled regularly and unappetizing, it wasn`t too expensive for a weekday lunch though so at least there`s that.   Ordering pick up. Yeesh. Really don`t do this. I hate using websites and whatnot to order my food I still prefer calling the restaurant and speaking to someone directly, unfortunately this is a really bad idea here. When you call to order you are exempt from all combo deals for some reason.   We ordered 1 medium stuffed crust pizza (half cheese, half pepperoni) and 14 chicken bites with ranch sauce and honey garlic sauce this cost a whopping 38$$$ specifically because since I wasn`t ordering online I wasn`t eligible for the deals. I call bullsh*t, that`s just stupid. Anyways fine. So we order pick up 20 minutes before arriving in store to pick it up, there`s a line up at the pick up counter and it`s not a clear line so you hafta constantly tell others you arrived before them so it`s your turn, then when I finally got to state my order she hands me a luke warm box that i can feel the soggy through the cardboard, great. (Sarcasm)  Then once at home the tiny medium pizza is so not hot by that point the stuffed crust is just congealed mozarella and bread. Yum. Not.   The chicken bites were freaking delicious though so definitely order those. The Ranch dipping sauce was great, I wasn`t a fan of the honey garlic sauce here.   Overall must avoid in the future. No point in wasting hard earned cash here.<2<11<2019<15<23<34

I made my appointment back in June and she was so helpful. I called the call center and spoke with christen. She was held a whole conversation about me while I was supposed to be on hold. I informed her I wanted to schedule with Dr. Woodson for a full body Christen told me that was fine and schedule me with Erika Kimble. Beautiful women. She has patience. Upon my arrival to the office I was meet very very rudely by Shannon. After explaining to her that I was here for Dr. Woodson she told she was not here and I could reschedule it took literally two months to get an appointment and now I have to make another appointment. Told her no that`s unfair. She looks at me and says very rudely well I don`t know what to tell you. Delicia must have been that girls saving grace because just as I was about to ask her what is going she asked the other girl if everything was okay. Shannon pulls her to the side and tells her not realizing the whole Damn office can hear her. Delicia comes back from around the corner to a door and opens the door she asked me if I could step into a room with. In my mind they send this black girl to do the clean up work. She says ma`am before we get started please allow me to express my deepest apologies for what took place up front and please allow me to apologize for the miss communication. My office did schedule you with the work provider. I roll my eyes. Delicia smile said I have a couple of options that may be able to correct this problem. Delicia said I`m sure you had to wait one to two months just for this appointment so here is option 1 we can step outside and I can get you scheduled with Dr. Woodson. Please keep in that her schedule fills up pretty quickly and you may have to wait a couple of weeks. So I reply what`s options two. Delicia smiles and say I`m glad you ask I can put you in this one time with Erika Kimble and your next follow up visit will be with Dr. Woodson. It was so much that she gave these super awesome choices it was the fact that she didn`t put blame on anyone else, she stayed smiling, respectful and helpful. I don`t know what her actual job was at the time but she calmed me down in cool, respectful way. I had nothing but respect. She got me to stay and meet Erika Kimble who was amazing. When you get pass the call center and front the other staff are amazing. I was saddened when I went back one  or two weeks ago just for a check up and Delicia wasn`t there. So new Spanish girl was there. I asked  rude one at the front desk Shannon said she took a medical leave no body really knows if she doing okay or not. I was surprised that she just flat out told me everything. Out of respect for her I won`t say everything but, it has be a month she has been out and I will say I do hope everything is okay and I hope to see her soon. As for call center and the rude front desk they are a force and and out of pocket for telling employees business and needs to be removed. I would have told the doctor but she seems like she doesn`t care. Dr. Woodson is a sweet lady but you can tell she doesn`t really know her employees or care. I just hope this will be back soon. Delicia went above and beyond for me I hope the company knows she was the only reason I am still with Linda Woodson Dermatology on Pecos Rd in Henderson.<24<10<2019<6<26<40

zmr8GGkVji5fx-79dhKPEA<e81WVcojELA5DIUd3tkNew<jahXPL5FWiiDdylJmXx5yw<3<1<0<0<Although Dr.Lamb is a very knowledgeable surgeon and seems like a nice gentleman, I am dissatisfied with his business practices.   I was recommended to Dr.Lamb through a family friend and my dentist. My first consult was successful and I had nothing but faith in my decision to choose his practice. Then it all began to change.   Firstly, they broke the verbal payment plan agreement without immediately telling me. I was quoted a payment plan during my consult for the out of pocket cost which would be due day of the wisdom tooth surgery. When I called 3 days prior to discuss another matter, the accountant then informed me that I would owe 75% of the cost up front, not 50%. She admitted that what we verbally agreed to on consult day, Dr.Lamb did not approve. I asked to speak to the doctor (as a college student paying out of pocket does not have an extra money laying around) but I was not allowed to speak to the doctor.   Secondly, the price estimate for procedures does NOT show the out of pocket cost. If you are using insurance, the estimate only shows the contracted rate for the service. Once you max out your insurance, you owe more than the cost quoted on the estimate (I`m not talking about patient responsibility or insurance responsibility estimate, literally the `cost` of the service).  Weeks after my surgery, the accountant called me back to say I owe more because Dr.Lamb does not honor contracted rates for out of pocket cost. Instead of paying $388 for one wisdom tooth extraction, I was required to pay $518, etc...  Thirdly, dealing with the accountant was like pulling teeth. She would interrupt me, speak over me, and talk down to me. I have dealt with many different billing departments and I have never been treated that way by a professional.   If I had known what I knew today about Dr.Lamb`s business, I would have shopped around for someone else.<6<11<2019<15<18<1

As a subset of Mandalay Bay, this hotel nestled on the Southern end of the Strip offered my friends and I a great stay during her recent birthday celebration.  We were upgraded to a wonderful suite that featured a large, open bedroom, ample seating areas and a dining room table. The interior was clean, crisp, and very modern. TV screens were placed in mirrors and the beds/sofas we all nestled on after going out were comfortable. Only the master bedroom had a shower which was big but definitely all see-through. We made use of the king-sized sheets to cover up this for some modesty.  Only major gripe was that there was no actual fridge located inside of the rooms. We had a small mini fridge which you know is not enough for a bunch of adults looking to get a little buzzed.  Delano was a great stay and one I`d consider again.

lGQGShz-88H4_SIEpjamQQ<-2FX4aYflB60Zab1evigHQ<CLc2KOl-O0p5AesNGEUHaw<1<19<4<0<"I feel like me and my son are being personally targeted and retaliated against because I attempted to hold my son`s daycare accountable. Because I refused to accept subpar care for my child. Because I held his daycare to a standard level of care that is outlined in the AZDHS rules and in their own policies. Because I feel like he deserves to be in a SAFE environment. Because I expect to get what I am paying for. Because THEY don`t feel I DESERVE to get what I paid for. Because they thought they were doing me a favor by watching my son. Because I am a young, black, (EDUCATED) single mother.  I enrolled my son at Elite Preschool and Learning Center in Tolleson, AZ and I have never experienced such discriminant, negligent, and -considering it is also a church- unChristian-like behavior. I moved from the East Valley to the Westside in October, and after checking the daycare out I thought it would be a great place to put my son so I placed my name on the waiting list. It was at church so my son could receive a Christian-based foundation, it was close to home, it had a seemingly loving, family atmosphere and it was a decent price. Little did I know I was sadly mistaken. On his first day at the daycare, one of the classroom teachers gave my son milk, to which he is extremely allergic. IT COULD HAVE KILLED HIM. Not only did she give it to him but the teacher NEVER EVEN KNEW HE WAS ALLERGIC. I outlined this in ALL of his paperwork and told the Director, Karon Smith directly. There is no excuse for the incompetence of the staff other than the fact that the director did not do her job of making sure everyone was educated and aware to ensure my son`s safety. This is CHILD ENDANGERMENT. Additionally, when Karon called me she completely minimized the incident. She mentioned that it was unacceptable but said my son only had a little bit and they had responded to it quickly by giving him Benadryl and his emergency inhaler immediately and that he was fine. She did not sound urgent or make it seem as if he was doing or responding badly to his treatment.  When I arrived at the daycare I spoke to the director, Karon. She informed me she didn`t know that his allergies were really so severe (even though I wrote it down and spoke with her about it. Apparently she needed my son to almost die to believe me or understand the true meaning of the terms severe and life-threatening).  When I went to the classroom my son was sitting on the classroom floor at the feet of a teacher crying. She tells me he has been '"crying all day.'" What?! At what point is it okay for a child to be crying all day? Why wouldn`t you call me? That is not normal or okay. And, if that is the case, why wouldn`t you be attempting to soothe him? We make it to the car and I realize that he`s not crying because he missed me, he`s crying because HE CAN`T BREATHE. No one cared enough to notice and to tend to this issue by giving his rescue inhaler or contacting me. I felt as a parent I was not given all of the facts or accurate information to make the best decision possible for the health and safety of my son. It is obvious that he was not just given '"a little bit'" and if he had already broken out in hives it meant that it was not immediately treated and if his breathing was that arrested it meant that the milk had been in his system long enough for his respiratory system to be compromised. Additionally, they did not provide me an incident report, which is required by law, that outlined the actual event and they still to this day claim not to really know what exactly happened. And when they did provide the report 3 days later it had no details about the event and Karon attempted to backdate it as if it had been completed the day of the incident. All night I was up giving him breathing treatments and comforting him due to the negligent act of the daycare. By the next morning I had finally gotten him to a stable condition for school. And the next day I still had to leave work early because his breathing had worsened again. I completed my enrollment packet, filled it out with all the required information, included multiple documents detailing my sons life-threatening asthma, food allergies to milk/dairy and peanuts, and medications he needs. I paid my tuition. Provided a change of clothes as outlined. AND I went over all of these things with the daycare director when I submitted my documentation. They accepted it, stating that his allergies and asthma would not be a problem. As a mother I did everything to ensure the daycare was in the best position to take care of my son. BUT STILL ON THE FIRST DAY ONE OF THE STAFF ALMOST KILLED MY SON. Then when I asked for some sort of compensation for the events that occurred throughout the week (this wasn`t my only concern) the director had the audacity to tell me that they watched my son for 7 hours that day and she didn`t feel like I warranted a refund. As if my son being there for 7 hours makes up for the fact that he almost died."<3<3<2016<18<25<37

I know, I know, it`s the weekend, there is a metric crap ton of people in downtown Gilbert, but it`s still kinda ridiculous. I`m sure if you did, you would get someone on the other side saying the same thing. Oh well. You can`t make everyone happy, but it wouldn`t hurt to try it out. I`m sure just about any other day than Saturday or Sunday this isn`t a problem.   Just gonna find a proper coffee house/cafe.<13<10<2018<16<24<9

However, there were quite a few negatives...   The chicken we tried was bland and the pork was nothing to write home about. The chicken, pork, and even the cornbread was dry. We asked for a side of potatoes and didn`t realize they were missing until it was too late. The pulled pork sandwich was made with a cheap/soggy bun so we had to eat it with a fork as it was falling apart. The BBQ sauce--which we used to try and make everything not taste so dry--tasted like vinegar. Maybe I`m missing something here, but it just was not good.<18<11<2019<20<43<25

8XFP01PT9KP7H66p3gXBNA<8UymnRX7b7XwJ2s7vhNCew<utIA0LyQmwP-9DRyxUe6qQ<3<10<5<5<"I wanted to love this place, I really did. But, I am not a sheep and not going with the masses. The food is absolutely 5 stars - no doubt! The manager, Leah did rectify the problems we had and was EXTREMELY acomodating (love her), But here is my review, take it or leave it.  The first hit I will own. We came here on a Sunday at 1pm. We walked straight to the counter and put our name in. They said it would be an hour and 15 wait.  I sucked it up because I have been wanting to try this place. Plus there is a bar, so why not wait. Wrong answer.   Annoyance 1 - Head to the left of the bar, this is where you can order drinks. However, there is no distinct line (there is a very small sign that says '"order drinks here'". People cut in front of you and pretty much walk into the bar back area to flag down a bar tender. The bar tenders are so busy they don`t care and will serve whoever aggressively gets their attention first. So those who thought we were in line - wrong! People cut, no one cares. It`s mass chaos. However, me being a loud mouth spoke up when I saw a woman weaseling her way past me into the  the bar back area, then giving her order. I got the bartenders attention and she quickly took my order.   Annoyance 2 - It`s December and it cold outside, however add some heating lamps outside and BOOM, you`ve just added customers to your 12 or so tables OUTSIDE which oleviates the overcrowding! I would have been more than happy to take a table outside if there were heaters. All tables were empty outside which caused mass crowding inside and longer waits.  Annoyance 3 - They have complimentary coffee at the front for those who are waiting. Super nice right? Well not when there is NO COFFEE and NO SUGAR and no STIRRERS! Just gobs of cups and some cream. I had to ask several times about the coffee and they said it was being made. Okay, by now they should know how popular this place is and have a distinct job for a coffee maker. The hostess did grab a cup for me and when behind the bar and to get me a some coffee. Super nice, but what about everyone else that doesn`t ask?   Make the customers happy if we are waiting so stinking long. Finally coffee was brought out, but still no sugar or stirrers. Just cracked me up.   Annoyance 4 - It was actually 1 1/2 to get a table not 1 and  fifteen. Trust me, when you have been waiting that long, an extra 15 mins is a heck of a long time!   Final Annoyance 5 - I am a HUGE people watcher. I was watching customers at the bar. One girl gets a text that her table is ready, but she has already ordered food at the bar. She shows the text to a patron she has been talking to at the bar. She tells her to just take her name and go up to the hostess stand. So the girl does. I watch this all go down mind you and I am livid because I know the second girl came in long after me and i am dying to eat at this point (it`s almost my time to be called and I am angry hungry). I watch the conversation between the hostess and the girl. The hostess realizes that it`s not the original girl who put her name in, BUT STILL GIVES HER THE TABLE! All the while I hear her telling the other hostess that, '"sometimes we do this.'" Now, it would be EXTREMELY coincedental that this girl`s name was actually the next name on the list, but I know what I saw. So,  at this point I am beyond LIVID and walk up to her and tell her I saw exactly what went down and I want to see her manager.   Life at Snooze gets a better now. In walks the manager, Leah. I explain what happened and she is beyond apologetic. I had seen her through what seemed like `my day experience at Snooze` and she has been roughing it being the bar. All wet from cleaning, running around everywhere. Super hard worker. Anyway, she says that she has just come back from vacation and there are things they working on and will be meeting with the staff soon, which made me feel relieved. She immediately got us seated at the next available table. Brought us a complimentary cinnamon roll pancake (the bomb) and made sure we were well taken care of. After that things were so much better all thanks to Leah. It`s the small stuff and a smile on someone`s face that can change your mood in a split second.   My friend ordered the breakfast pot pie, I got the pancake flight (you chose which three you want). I had pumpkin, chocolate chip and the drunkenmunky french toast). I do have to admit that some of the pancakes are a little to sweet for my liking but delicious non the less. I am in love with the french toast!  I also ordered the hash browns (ask for them extra crispy).   Service was slow and by this point there was hardly anyone dining. It was an all afternoon affair snooze. We get there at 1 and we didn`t leave until 4. I can think of a million other wonderful ways to spend my Sunday afternoon. Was the food worth it? YES, but NOT for the amount of time we spent there. I would absolutely suggest you going on a week day. Thank you Leah for saving the day."<19<12<2016<14<46<42

Although recovery lasted about 7-14 days, I wasn`t in any pain throughout the process and I would describe it as extremely mild.  Dr Hobgood`s pre and post op paperwork was clear and the surgery center was perfect. Even on days when I was early to Dr Hobgood`s office, I never had a wait.

Got there 15 minutes after order was supposed to be finished and waited for another 10 minutes to get our pizza and calzone. The food was good, but service really sucked! There was no apology about either forgetting to make our order or for messing it up and having to remake it.  We Decided to try them out again, giving them the benefit of the doubt for our first visit. Second time around, a Tuesday night, and our order wasn`t ready again!

My mom was worried about parking bcs it`s on the strip but I assured her that there`s parking.  It`s in a small strip mall right after Encore and before Ross right on Las Vegas Blvd.   We arrived around noon and we were the first customers.    We ordered our usual: Seafood salad with creamy sauce Hamachi Kama  Agedashi tofu  Baked mussels  Uni Sweet shrimp  Tempura udon Double dragon roll Misc sushi   I really liked how they separated the tempura items from the soup bcs it always get soggy so bravo for the chef for having some common sense.  The hamachi Kamas were really meaty so that was a delight.  The baked mussels were huge and pretty tasty.  The uni and sweet shrimp was super fresh and tasty.  The whole time we were there there was only 3 other ppl that dined.  So service was speedy and the server was attentive.  She also reminded us about dessert bcs we had totally forgotten.    This location has become our favorite!  Its not as big as the Spring Mountain location and I sort of hope it doesn`t get too too packed for lunch bcs that`s usually when we go.  The really cool thing is that they kept the same pricing as the other locations even though it`s on the strip - yay for them!   Oh and we love how they offer the '"special'" items (uni, sweet shrimp, surf clams) for lunch bcs all the other places only offer them for dinner bcs they want to charge extra for it.  So big kudos to Yama Sushi for not doing that.    All in all, it was a great lunch, everything was just so fresh and tasty.  I`m already planning on when to return!  Oh and one last thing, I was super happy they had Kama bcs the spring mountain hasn`t had it for months and the flamingo location is just sooo far and it feels crammed in there."<17<7<2019<6<46<11

Qualifications mattered to me, and upon inquiry, I found out that Dr. Roberts earned her doctorate in Physical Therapy from Cleveland State University. Awesome!  As an athlete, I am extremely thankful to Dr. Roberts, as her efforts not only helped me recuperate quickly, but improve as an athlete.  I worked with Dr. Roberts twice a week at ReFORM Physical Therapy and Pilates. The location was ideal for me (downtown Cleveland), and everyone, from the receptionist to the owners, were both kind and courteous.   I truly saw Dr. Roberts not just as my Physical Therapist, but my athletic trainer, as she was always:  1. energized for each PT session. 2. well-versed on my most-recent doctor`s notes and X-rays. 3. reviewing our prior PT session work in order to set good metrics for measuring my recuperative progress. 4. listening to my feedback (ie. my acceptable pain/soreness tolerances during PT) 5. pushing me to become better (i.e. resulted in improved balance and agility). 6. sending a follow-up email after each session reviewing the exercises we completed during a given PT session.  I highly recommend Dr. Roberts as a Physical Therapist, as she is the consummate professional, and will continue to accomplish great things in this field.<30<7<2019<18<5<18

You definitely feel bit slugglish after eating it. The portion is big though and it`s really filling.  The hainanese chicken rice was okay. Good, but not awesome. The chicken was a bit too oily and a little bit rubbery? But still recent. The rice was nothing special. Sauces were okay as well.

_bZg5bDEeuWy77hqyX6GEA<KiXkvugLXYtWyGHJRU8-Og<k-tg18rWRibZ4jKpoqhb0Q<3<2<1<1<Honestly, I`d give a full five stars to this place if it weren`t for their ridiculous prices. The food was top notch, the service was helpful and friendly, the restaurant was clean and had nice ambiance and there is stuff here that you won`t find in other places. I`m docking two full stars for how overpriced this is. I came for the wings after reading some articles about this place but I will rarely be able to eat here becuase I can not justify paying $36 for a large order of wings. That`s nuts. they aren`t really big wings either like you might find at Buffalo Wild Wings. I don`t think I would even get completely filled up for that price. I`m bummed because I would eat here all the time if their prices were reasonable or if they had a weekly discount or happy hour deal.<30<10<2019<20<18<50

ZEgFjxevkzKffRKLac-pUQ<gERe-EPQPDsEkWu2fKeRYA<8Z2GBnuOEXbnzzapWSo9tg<5<0<0<0<"'"Upscale Irish Food'" those are the words that are my take away from Murph`s presentation last night.  You know, I never thought about it, but he`s right. Every other Irish Bar I`ve ever been to had '"bar food'" quality with an Irish twist. This place is definately a step above. Add in the passion he feels for his place, and you have a recipe for success. That Irish passion I had to stop and think about too, as he explained his goals to be with ya thru the celebrations and help to navigate thru the lows.  Yep, that`s the Irish folk there for ya. Add some drinks and a story and there ya go. My family is Irish on both sides (hence my red hair) and that`s what I see.   I`ve been here once before, and appreciated the food... but the story brings in so much more. My fiance and I came in previously to scout this place out for our rehearsal dinner while planning our wedding in Spring 2020 at St. Patrick`s Cathedral nearby (see a theme here ?) We tried the shepard`s pie, fish and chips, beers, and chess pie.  I was so excited to be able to join this YEE event to try so much more food on the menu ! It was like a great, big tasting for my rehearsal dinner !   To start, the Synge drink was A-MAZ-ING. I don`t even like gin, but it was so perfectly blended with the pear puree and simple syrup with an infusion of rosemary, I could have had 3 of these. Yummy ! Hats off to the bartender and, again, I learned something new from his presentation that you`re not supposed to taste the alcohol in a properly blended drink. I`m getting an education here !   The appetizers were really nice, but the star was the bbq Cajun shrimp over cauliflower grits (that were JUST califlower). Wow, just wow !  The flavor was fabulous.   I got the veggie soup and that was really interesting. I`ve never had a veggie soup without chunks. I could see this being excellent if you`re feeling under the weather and want to send a friend/spouse out to get ya some soup.  Yes... so comforting. I got the coq au vin to be different, since I`ve had the fish and shepard`s pie here before. Yes, oh yes. This isn`t your typical chicken option on a menu. This chicken has some Flav-A. Marinated in red wine, delicately moist, and with a yummy mushroom sauce served over mashed potatoes with asparagus.  Now, for the omg.... chocolate chess pie. The pudding-like center was heaven. I got this the last time I was here, but this version was COMPLETELY different. Whatever recipe you all used this time PLEASE keep it. I would order this every time. The Irish Creme Brule was really yummy too. Actually, it was perfect.   Finished off the meal with an Irish peppermint coffee drink. I don`t even like the taste of coffee, yet I found myself finishing this off thru to the last sip. This bartender is a magician, I tell ya.   Thank you so much Inishmore and Nikki for such a fabulous evening with fantastic food and meeting fellow Yelp elites !  Murph and I are surely going to be in touch to discuss the next steps on my wedding rehearsal dinner plans to bring that Irish flare to our nuptials.  See ya soon !"<10<12<2019<21<51<56

Treat this company like the one week old, rotting, disease-ridden carcass of that opossum you passed on the road to work this morning.   I`ve spent five (5) months trying to get a simple change of ownership completed.  Five. Months.  We sold the location that had TDS service to someone else.  Did I mention that it`s been five months?  Five.  Hopefully it`s done now, but I don`t know for sure yet.  In the last five months we`ve had to constantly forward bills to the new service owner, and deal with any issues they`ve had with the service since they can`t call in, because the service hasn`t been transferred to their name yet...  Five. Months.<7<1<2019<15<34<20

I was recommended by Lisa (currently the owner with her sister stephy) to try out Stephy`s Russian volume and wouldn`t be disappointed. I went to my first appointment with her to do a complete new set, she took her time explaining the tips and care and the process. My fill lasted about 2-3 weeks full and I`m the person who typically likes to maintain the fullness look but after my lash retention being really good, I pushed it to 4 weeks now. Typically I don`t experience any other technicians who would follow up and  text you, how are the lashes doing and are my eyes okay. I do feel they both genuinely do care about their clients, the products they use and the service they provide. The environment of flirtyflutter is super chic and it`s just my zen place that  gives me an hour to my self just to nap while doing my eyelashes! I highly recommend their work and service!<10<1<2018<2<51<45

If you are a visitor you do have to check in at the North Campus first. Three Square Food Bank is AWESOME! I just recently started volunteering more this year with my job, and Three Square has been one of the consistent places that we partner with to come out and help.   Being a volunteer and apart of such a great movement just really feels good. One of the great things that I learned on my first visit here is that they don`t just feed families in Clark County but also Nye, Lincoln and Esmeralda! The food that they receive comes from multiple resources such as local retail and grocery stores  The actual volunteer work is really fun and rewarding! It works just like a buffet.. Essentially they line up all these different canned foods and snacks so that you can just go down the line and put whatever quantity of items are needed for each bag and once you reach 3,000 bags for that day your humble volunteer work is done! I will be back many more times throughout the year.<23<3<2018<20<24<54

DCfo5zFmdYpilk984PjYDw<y77GGCw8wEyLK9gHrjOjTA<Ak08F6RqjHYmVCzweBbTrQ<2<1<0<1<It was not in our cards to try one of the bookmarked thai restaurant. To our dismay the other thai restaurant was closed until Thanksgiving. Anyways, we decided to try to wild thaiger since it had so many yelp and Google reviews.   Parking: Don`t get mistaken thinking parking is next to the restaurant in the empty lot. Unless you park at your own risk. For the parking, it`s located at the back of the restaurant.   Service: in my opinion, the service sucked and the waitress were unfriendly. Although the restaurant was empty, they didn`t care to ask if we need additional water or anything else.   Menu: different than other thai restaurant. I wanted to order thai fried rice. The waitress asked me what is that. Ha ha. We`re at the thai restaurant, right? And they don`t have thai fried rice.   Inside: it was nicely decorated. Don`t be fooled by how the outside of the building or bumpy parking lot looks.  She told us order directly from the menu. We did exactly as the madame told us to do. We ordered pad sie ew with shrimp. Two small shrimp cost is $3. In  California,we are spoilt. We would have got more for that much money. And they charge $0.50 for thai chillies. Again in California, it`s free. . The noodles were super sweet. I believe tons of sugar was added.<29<11<2019<15<7<50

dk2eRBuQoX6tAjGBlYFDtw<x4meYN2CH5zN2xy-GQPHWg<Ax2JxfCUjfBkRxcqfA4QLw<2<2<0<0<High prices and mediocre produce, lots of items that are near or past their code dates (apparently due to staff being too poorly trained to remove them when the code date is near) and lots of pre-made salads and deli items that look good and yet taste like they came from Safeway but carry Whole Foods very high prices!  Their bakery section items are very much `mixed`.  Some are truly great. Others, not so much. If you use their online delivery service, your order may be really badly butchered. Old or past-sell-by-date produce and/or dairy items. Cracked or broken eggs, etc. Their online shoppers seem to grab the first item they see of a given group without regard to age, firmness, etc. This is a major problem when you`re paying their high prices.   I do not object to gourmet prices for high quality food. But I hate being ripped off which is what has happened to me almost every time I`ve ordered from Whole Foods. When it`s 104 degrees outside, I prefer to have my food order delivered to avoid the heat. Why they cannot train their shoppers and delivery people to do this task correctly and with care, I`ll never know. But apparently they do not.    Las Vegas is a strange town to live in. You can dial a pro who can provide whatever kinky things you can imagine. But finding truly great produce, groceries and service has been, to date, extremely elusive and we live in one of the most `upscale` areas of this city - a suburb called Summerlin - which seems to be LV`s answer to Beverly Hills or Pacific Heights... but without the service and quality both of those areas offer.   like I said, I do not mind paying higher prices for great quality. But I really resent being ripped off with a big ad budget and little else to recommend Whole Foods in Las Vegas.<2<8<2019<3<58<46

This facilty is one of the few near the State Capitol that can accomodate a large crowd and provide excellent food and service. The other benefit is that the proceeds help fund the Phoenix  Rescue Mission.   The restaurant is in the neighborhood that I grew up in just northeast of the Capitol. I used to go to the restaurant many years ago when it was called Bill`s Drive In and the house specialty was '"chicken in the rough'" but that is another story.

This event was such a blast and I could tell how much thought, creativity, and energy was put into making this a special event for everyone who attended. Old Sugar Distillery was closed for this private event, and we were greeted, welcomed in, and challenged with a fun guess-the-pun activity. I tried the Gringo cocktail, which was an Horchata and Honey Liquer drink - super tasty, and the bartenders were so friendly and personable. The room was 100% decorated in true Yelp style with themed plates, balloons, tablecloths - you name it. Awesome aesthetic and felt like a cozy environment to get to chat with other Yelpers! There was a food buffet featuring dishes from Hot N Spicy, which I`ve never tried before and I was totally blown away by. The pho and chicken egg rolls were so flavorful and delicious!   We were also lucky enough to hear from the awesome staff at Old Sugar Distillery, Hot N Spicy, and hear about their origins and ideas. I loved learning about the process that goes behind making an idea come to life, and learning lots about the apples that get chosen to make cider. There was also a traditional Vietnamese fan dance performance featuring a local organization from UW-Madison, which was lovely to see. Overall, such a wonderful event and I can`t wait to see the amazing things TD will do for the Madison Yelp Community!<21<11<2019<3<26<56

Aimant beaucoup le concept j`ai décidé d`essayer. Le décor est agréable, belles couleurs et décoration. La serveuse fut attentive à nos besoin. J`ai voulu essayer un plat que j`affectionne tout particulièrement à base d`aubergine, j`ai voulu essayer ce plat en tant que base de comparaison. Il était bon mais sans plus, je n`ai pas trouvé le mariage épicé/aubergine aussi bon que d`habitude. De plus nous étions assis à une table collé au chauffage mural et même si j`aime la chaleur j`avoue que ce n`était pas très agréable. J`ai le sentiment que cette expérience est parti sur un mauvais pied et je voudrais y retourner, essayer un plat différent et être assis à un autre endroit pour voir si ce restaurant a un potentiel pour 4 étoiles.

I`m a sucker for baked goods, so the cheese biscuits and the chocolate chip cookie (both made in-house) were the highlights for me.

Restaurant choices are also great with a steakhouse and Mexican option among the list . These are all pros! Some cons: you have to pay for parking ($55) and WiFi ($14 a day). There are cobblestone walkways and anytime a cart such as room service or the room cleaning carts come by you can hear it throughout your whole room.

There was a 2 hour wait, which wasn`t as bad as expected since Snooze has an assortment of games for people to play with while waiting, such as Connect 4 and Jenga, and a plethora of nearby stores to cool down in. Apparently they also send texts to let you know when your table is ready, but we never received one so I`m not sure how reliable that whole process is.   In all honesty, the food, decoration, and music of Snooze really deserve 5 stars, but i`m docking one due to their host. She was incredibly rude throughout our interaction with her and was very adamant about her estimated waittime. We checked with her ONCE after almost two hours of wait, and she insisted that we TECHNICALLY had one more minute on the quoted time!!! After making us wait that ONE EXTRA MINUTE, she put all nine of us in a medium-sized booth in the very back of the restaurant, that would have more comfortably fit 4 to 6 people.   Determined to have a good time, my friends and I ordered the CHILAQUILES BENEDICT, BENNY GOODMAN, BELLA! BELLA! BENNY, CAPRESE BENEDICT (ala the Benny Duo! a fantastic deal if you can`t decide on just one), OMG! FRENCH TOAST, SANDWICH I AM, and the PANCAKE OF THE DAY (strawberry cheesecake, I think?). Everyone was extremely pleased and were basically raving about the food all day. (Pro tip: ask for your hashbrowns to be flat and crispy). Additionally, the incredibly sweet waitress brought us PANCAKE FLIGHT of PINEAPPLE UPSIDE DOWN, PEANUT BUTTER CUP, and BLUEBERRY pancakes for my friend`s birthday.   Would I come back? Yeah, I would, but maybe in a couple more weeks after the hype dies down a little or they get a better host.<11<8<2016<20<44<43

For those wondering if the hype and the (almost guaranteed) wait at the door are worth it: Yes! The wait is because the entire process from being seated to getting your check is slow. This is a '"sit-down and enjoy your meal'" kind of place, not a '"grab a bite to eat and go'" kind of place. You come to Snooze for the experience first, food second. Not to say the food is forgettable (it`s not), but your experience at Snooze is slow and methodical. Enjoy your company (if you brought someone; if not, your morning paper), then enjoy your food."<20<7<2018<23<53<57
gIz_uX0QZpXXHOa3JwEwUw<MRahxF0UlFpY2t5d9AvhSA<utIA0LyQmwP-9DRyxUe6qQ<3<7<2<3<This place is a complete mixed bag for me. We waited 30 minutes at 8 a.m. on a Sunday, which wasn`t awful, but the space is cramped. The person at the counter takes your number so they text you when the table is ready, which is a great feature, but she messed up 3/3 numbers she took that I listened to. That`s impressively bad.  When we were seated, we took first available which was outside. It wasn`t too hot, so it was okay, but it was a 90 minute dining experience which made it progressively hotter and sunnier as the meal went on. Definitely wouldn`t do that almost any other time of year.  Our waitress was nice and friendly. My fiancé liked his hot chocolate, but the coffee was too strong for me. I tried 4 Stevias before I just gave up. He ordered the Chile Verde Benny and I ordered the pancake flight with the sweet potato, bourbon pumpkin, and special which was a donut type pancake. I also got a side of chicken sausage.   The coffee came out fairly timely, but the hot chocolate lagged by a while. Then it took over 30 minutes to get our dishes, which is odd given that the place isn`t that big and the menu isn`t that vast.   The menu variety gets a 5 from both of us. There`s a lot of interesting items that you can`t find elsewhere. The execution of the Chile Verde Benny was a 4. It was very tasty and unique, although a bit heavy. The waitress suggested the barbacoa, and my fiancé liked the dish.  The pancake flight wasn`t what I imagined. While I should`ve guessed from the photos, it was a complete sugar bomb. I like sweet, but not THAT sweet. The syrup was everywhere combined with candied nuts and sweetened cream. It was just a lot. The pancakes themselves were good, my favorite being the sweet potato, but that is a one-time experience for me. It`s just not something you would really want again IMO. The chicken sausage was solid. I hesitate to rate the pancakes, because I know some people are really into them. I`m a definite dessert person, but I don`t like pure sugar, so take that for what it`s worth.  For us, this is not a place we will rush back to, but we see the appeal and appreciate the menu. Waiting any more time than we waited though would be completely out of the question.<7<1<2018<0<21<48

I am very impressed with the variety of food and how they put everything together! The food was delicious!   Service was a little on the slower side, meaning we had to ask for our first glass of water twice as our waiter was super busy. I was a little confused when we first came in, there is a counter that says please enjoy coffee while you wait, but only water was present. There were a lot of other servers/helpers around that were also very helpful to us.   Parking is limited (what else is new in Houston)!

After looking through Yelp, I contacted a couple of places.  Matt arranged a time with the tenant to see the property, then called me immediately.  He said he could fix the door, but said it would be a patch only.  He then quoted a price for the new door, including installation, which was far better than his competitors.  He was even sensitive to the fact that there was  a homeowners` association that needed to be pleased.  The work was done quite quickly and my tenant was pleased with the result.  I can definitely r3commend this business.<16<9<2019<19<38<23

After seeing commercials for years and considering making some minor corrections to my teeth, I made an appointment online with the nearest location to see if this was a good decision. Everyone involved with smile direct club literally makes me smile. The moment I walked in I could tell everyone likes their job. I called to inform them I was running late to my 3:30pm appointment but they put me at ease by letting me know as long as I made it before 3:40-3:45pm I wouldn`t have to reschedule. Jeannie B. was the person that took the time to explain how the process works and she was very to-the-point and thorough. She`s so easy to communicate with. There was no pressure to make a decision right then either. I had more questions that Kai D. helped me solve. Everyone involved with this company is pleasant.

There was no reason, just that '"the dentist can`t do the filling and the hygienist can`t do the cleaning.'" No other explanation.

That package is a great value, plus it allows me to bring guests.  Straight men, DO NOT go on Friday nights. I just found this out last night. The place was a gay bath house. I`m not homophobic, I just don`t go to the gym to be stalked. It started in the locker room. This guy sat staring at me, at first I thought he was just waiting to get to his locker, then I realized all the lockers near me were empty. I even asked if I was in his way, he huffed and headed to the shower area. Then while on the floor, two guys were making out in the stretching area. While I was working out on a machine, locker room guy appear again. He sat at the machine across from me, not working out, just occasionally giving me a glance. The final straw for me was when he walked into the black card member area and sat there while I was on the hydro massage bed.

You can enter either the bar side inside the Union Trust Building or the main entrance on William Penn way. Since I arrived shortly after opening I had my pick of where I wanted to sit. The dining area is small but certain booths can accommodate a group of about 5 people.  WiFi is free. Passcode available upon request. I had a very nice and attentive waitress who took care of all my needs. I had heard that they are known for their potato bread. It normally sells for $6.00 as a 1st course so I looked for a way to save money and still sample it. The lunch menu gave me that opportunity to try the potato bread on a sandwich so I opted for the fried trout sandwich accompanied by a grain and vegetable salad as my side. I got my food fairly quickly. The sandwich was a big! It came with tartar sauce as well as cucumbers and romaine lettuce gracing it. I found it enjoyable since it wasn`t too greasy.  The grain salad was okay. Nothing to write home about. The menu does give vegetarian options but there are no vegan choices. There are gluten free options as well. This place is good for the working if you have a businessman`s lunch. Expect to pay otherwise. Reservations are recommended if you come during peak operating times. Brunch is served on weekends.

They gave me chicken but I ordered beef for the Khao Soi, and they`re willing to switch the whole plate for me, which I very much appreciate it. The flavour was great, better if there could be more broth, it felt more like a paste than a broth.

He apologized quickly, left and returned momentarily with a trash bag and a rubber glove. He then handed me the glove and said '"I can`t reach it'". Really?!

My go to place for breakfast and dinners to go, the only place I have found, where on two days of the week, they roast full turkeys for dinners. Both white and dark meat, (no processed white breast of sliced turkey), and with all the sides that go with it, I had gone there many times. Once I saw a waitress pour a pot of soup into the warming pot of soup at the counter, so sloppily she had poured it, that it had spilled all over the pot and warming plate, the counter, soup was everywhere.

I was shocked, didn`t know what to say, still stunned, like a zombie, I took my order to the register to pay, the cashier ask if everything was ok, I replied, '"yes, except the cockroach'" she replied, that`s great, (she didn`t even hear my reply), when I got home, I threw my dinner out. I haven`t been back, I understand a lot of restaurants may have problems with pest, but they must try to control the problem, but at 2:00 in the afternoon, on a busy day, a cockroach attempts to come home with me and my dinner to go,  what does it look like in the wee hours of the morning when workers arrive at 5 am? What is crawling all over the plates and silverware at 3 am in the dark hours of the early mornings?

I have yet to try their curry pan though which is something I love from everyone in Japan. Their curry spice levels require a nominal fee and the overall price for your entree of curry will be a pretty penny. But quality and taste is what gives its worth! It can get crowded and the parking can be a nightmare. There is another smaller location in Southwest if you want to not worry about these two factors. And apparently a newly opened location in North LV as well. So you have options.  I have been curious about their kastudon but always get sucked into the deliciousness of curry instead. Someone let me know about their bowls please!  To be honest, the katsu chicken and pork are nearly identical in taste. So I`ve started to opt for chicken instead (the original white meat). I`d highly recommend. My partner has ordered more toppings but I like my curry simplistic.<27<11<2019<20<10<12

hxzOMY4GVORmvSaSImjogg<OKX-V5j_qfuOebeHeWGrHg<L-Yj3Y1bYKTSg4uE9KTVBw<3<10<2<4<For a bit of background, I lived in Texas for four years, and since moving back to Los Angeles I`ve scowered California and the broader continent alike for brisket in particular that comes even close to what I routinely had across Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, and Lockhart. Nothing has come close, and maybe it`s the expectation driven by the hype around Adamson up here in Toronto that lead to a bit of disappointment. Make no mistake this is good barbecue and I love how successful Adamson is, but if you`re looking for something to compare to Franklin`s or Black`s or Pecan Lodge you`re not going to find something identical here at Adamson.   Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  Well they`ve certainly got the atmosphere down. Visible smoker aside this was as if I was walking into any BBQ joint in Texas from the menu to the setup to the meats and sides offered. The people behind the counter couldn`t have been friendlier, and I found myself laughing out loud as my assigned brisket cutter was talking to the cut of meat as though it was his significant other. Star.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  You can get meats by the pound at Adamson that are comparably priced to what you might find in any other slightly expensive city (Los Angeles, SFO, etc.), but as I was really only here for the brisket I went with a $15.00 lunch plate that included two sides, which was a good deal. Star.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  While the optics and attitude were all there, the product simply wasn`t the same, and I`ll start with the brisket. You can google Franklin`s Barbecue brisket or Pecan Lodge brisket and what you`ll find is genuinely at times a quarter inch of `crust`, that is, the flavorful smoked salt and pepper casing around the cut of brisket. That`s where brisket is made or broken, and my first little tinge of disappointment here was that the crust around my cut of brisket, and the associated flavor, didn`t quite compare. Additionally, the brisket didn`t really have that distinct smokey flavor that you`ll find elsewhere.   Regarding the sides - they were fine, but I was a bit surprised to not see a hot mac and cheese option, and the pinto beans were slightly undercooked and also without that smokey flavor that comes with mixing a bit of brisket into the beans as is common elsewhere. At the end of the day a lot of this is just personal preference, but my experience didn`t quite align with what was sky high hype. Single Star.   Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?  Adamson Barbecue is doing great business here in Toronto, but my quest for brisket comparable to Texas outside of Texas continues. No Star.<16<8<2019<20<44<25

-hhYpkj91XxCVttO0UFiYA<MMd1cU2A9M74I473G3sYlw<XYIPXJ9parr9FtvvcGI1SA<5<6<5<4<"This is the most authentic hand pulled noodles I`ve had in North America. I`ve had my fair share of noodles and this is the best place I`ve been to.  When I walked in, I was reminded of when I was in China and enjoyed some authentic hand pulled noodles in beef broth that my grandma made for me.  When the chef started making the noodles, the slaps of the dough on the counter allowed me to understand the skill and love the chef puts into making his noodles.   When the server came out with our orders in less than 3 minutes, I was extremely impressed with the speed of service. It was almost immediate after we ordered, and we had a group of 7, most of whom ordered the flat noodles, which I feel like are probably less popular in the West.   The presentation of the noodles was very aesthetic. I usually don`t take pictures of my food because my friend has a better camera but I wanted to send a picture to my parents for when they come to Toronto. The noodles were hidden below the beef slices which were arrayed below the surface of the broth, with the radish, cilantro, and onions stacked in the middle.   The food itself was very delicious - the noodles were supple and boiled to perfection, the broth was delicious and hot, but not too hot, and the chili oil was both spicy and fragrant.  After finishing, our server asked how the food was, and I felt embarrassed that my Chinese isn`t good enough to fully express how much I enjoyed the experience, so I just told him '"See you tomorrow'".  Overall, I am extremely satisfied. I only regret that I wasn`t super hungry before eating, so I couldn`t drink all the soup and only got the Large instead of the MEGA size. I was so satisfied that I downloaded Yelp and made an account just to write this review, even though I have limited roaming data.  Thanks for reading, and if you didn`t, just do yourself a favor and come enjoy a bowl of noodles!"<11<10<2019<0<45<23
Q-uRHA6yMH3p2Bf0u7gW_w<UzwJDDl0P2t5WjI8z-itvQ<ZbQC5MCxZPg2HhrQ2VV4lw<1<1<0<0<Was there for spring break. The line was short but still took forever and once we got to the counter we figured out why. They ask you a ton of irrelevant questions and ask you if you want like 5 different kinds of insurance. I told her I didn`t want the insurance and she asked if I wanted to waive it and I said yes, which apparently meant charge me $158. I tried to ask her about the amount when it came on the screen but she was coughing and had to go in the back for a few minutes and it was all over after that. She took us for the $158.   The car was stained inside and she never explained that we had to do an inspection on the vehicle by ourselves. Budget has refused to refund me the waiver money.   Our flight was cancelled so we rented a car from Enterprise. Staff was friendly, no high pressure insurance sales, and they had someone with us through ever step of the process. I would definitely recommend Enterprise.   As for Budget, I will never use them again.<27<4<2017<2<7<55
9_zo3lJIO4AUXO1wu4pIqw<D8b45xLl1LN5M-6M_emEoQ<ZbQC5MCxZPg2HhrQ2VV4lw<1<3<0<0<I had a reservation made prior to arriving to pick up my vehicle at McCarran airport in Las Vegas. I was told that the Suburban that I reserved wasn`t available and I could get a Tahoe or Mini Van (Toyota Sienna). Both of those vehicles wouldn`t fit the 7 adults plus luggage and carry on`s. I didn`t have much choice but to get the mini van and asked when the Suburban would be available. The rep said that they should have one available in 4 hours or so.  So we all squeezed into the mini van and drove to the hotel to drop off the baggage, then shopping. I was called and notified that Budget has the Suburban that I reserved available and I would have to return the mini van and go to the Fastbreak stand and they would have my vehicle ready. So after getting the van from the Fashion Show Mall parking and driving back to Budget and returning the van, we (my 91 year old mother and my disabled wife) went to the Fastbreak stand and waited to get the suburban. They (Budget) couldn`t find the vehicle. We had to wait in the cold for 15+ minutes. After locating the vehicle, they gave me the paperwork and with no apologies said it was located in one of the A row stalls. That was the farthest location it could be parked. So we all had to walk all the way over in the cold to the vehicle.  Bottom line, bad customer service all the way around. If someone reserves something and it`s not available, upgrade them. Also have your reps learn some customer service and have the vehicle parked closer for a customer that`s wasting their time coming back for a proper size vehicle that they originally reserved.<13<12<2018<21<52<18

The employee told me the food is usually prepared quickly so I decided to stay for lunch. The line up to pay and order was 20 minutes. It took another 15 minutes of standing there with the receipt in my hand until I got my takeout. There was only 2 employees working inside.   If you`re thinking to come here for lunch, keep in mind that it will take minimum 30-35 minutes before you can get your food.   Probably won`t come back again.

No one greeted us and I didn`t know if we order at the counter or its a sit and order The employees were just standing behind the counter not caring about who walks in. We ordered pork dumpling and it was okay. The sauce were salty , but maybe that`s how its suppose to be served. I ordered the Tonkotsu and my bf ordered Azusa. They are cheap with the portions and the broth is not that flavorful. They need to work on the broth more and the portions. They also do not have sesame oil, which I find it upsetting. Alley was kind enough to check on my table and ask how we were doing. She also gave us a gift card as to thank us for being new customers. I will be returning and see how it goes.<12<9<2019<3<33<47

I forgot my date ordered the same sauce, so when he said tomato sauce I thought it was hers.  It was on mine, then she reminded me we got the same thing. After a long search I found our waitress.  She argued that it was the arrabiatta sauce because she could see a pepper that neither my date or I could see.  She brought out the correct sauce for me to put on top of the wrong sauce. She left and as I got angry, I got up to find her again.  I asked her can I just get what I ordered, that`s why I come here, she had a big attitude but did it.  They F-d with it because it was much hotter then usual.  Another long search for her to get the check, she`s outside talking to a friend.

I tried to meet with The sales rep, I called several times a week , notified their supervisor and I never had a call back to discuss my concerns. I recently bought my son a new car and we went to the Bell Toyota. They were wonderful. They literally scammed me. They refused to look through the paperwork to show the original document I signed.

They like to walk away and come back like there lost but this is so you spend so much time there that you just take their new more expensive deal. They change the price of the car to over $2,000. plus dollars. Then proceeded to say the car was sold. Also they said the person who made the deal was new. But the finance man insured me that he had been doing this with them for years. Lie after lie. Just don`t go there it`s not worth your time disrespect or their pompous attitude.

I was surprised it would take so long so she said 15 days she could do instead which still seemed like a long time but I agreed. I went in today to pick up the dress, 2 days after it was supposed to ready and the lady could not find the dress. After 5-10 mins of looking she finally found the dress in a bag on a table, unaltered where it had been sitting for over 2 weeks. The lady asked me if I could come back later and promised to have it done but I decided not to waste anymore time with this business and took the dress home, pulled out my sewing machine and made the alteration myself in 10 mins for free.

eAoiJwPTR4MScq12xNQAPg<wTfb2nfzPIyFcYQArdPtuQ<wrhPNdPh0FfSv3DMS0obhw<3<82<43<74<When I was checking out the Butterfly Wonderland, the ticket office offered a dual package deal if I wanted to also see OdySea as well.   Although I didn`t have time then, I got the information, and it sounded worth a visit. So, I finally got a chance to check it out.   ODYSEA AQUARIUM   Located in Scottsdale, Arizona, OdySea Aquarium is the largest marine aquarium in the Southwestern portion of the United States.   Containing more than 2,000,000 U.S. gallons of water, spanning over 200,000 square feet, the OdySea is an all-day attraction you`re going to need some time to explore.  Home to 30,000 animals and 500 different species, at any given time, the aquarium plays host to 50 different exhibits, with educational, interactive, and entertaining experiences awaiting visitors of all ages.  To create such a magnificent facility, over 2 million pounds of steel, 1,198 beams, and 12,300 cubic yards of concrete were used to get it moving.  Today, it contains 5,455 linear feet of acrylic observation windows, contains 2 million gallons of water, and features a life support system with 300 pumps and 42,000 linear feet of piping.   There are many unique touches I noticed, including the river walkways, birds in flight architectural accents, cattails, and generational footprints that have been incorporated into its physical presentation.  THE EXPERIENCE  Some of the most notable experiences included: the OdySea Voyager, the newest and largest exhibit to the aquarium, the Aqua Lobby, which was one of my favorite parts, the Rivers of the World, the Penguin Point, Touch Pools, Otter Banks, Reef Jewels, Bizarre & Beautiful Pop ups, Shapes of the Deep on the underwater escalator, Ocean Art, and seasonal movies.   There is also the Penguin Interaction Program, and a Behind the Scenes Tour for those wishing to learn more about the facility.   Designed and developed by Martin Pollack, he is the present operator and manager of the aquarium.  OdySea offers a 3D movie experience, called SeaTREK underwater ocean walking.  It`s uncomfortable bench seating with funky 3D glasses, in an open room. Filled with families, it`s an interesting and informative show, but it`s definitely more geared toward children.  As a big fan of lighting and architecture, the 9 massive globe-shaped aquariums suspended from the lobby ceiling, a giant martini glass shaped aquarium, a submerged escalator that enables guests to descend deep into the ocean, were definitely some of my favorite architectural features of OdySea.  The main event is the Living Sea Carousel that takes viewers through the Open Ocean, Sea Turtle, Sea Lion/Seal, and Shark exhibits.   I saw all of the exhibits, and my favorite was the sea turtles. Although there actually weren`t a lot of sea turtles to see at the time, as some were at the bottom resting, most of the sea turtles had been rescued and would have otherwise perished; I saw some missing a limb, some with damage to their shells, but swimming around quite happily.  Interestingly, a lot of turtles, specifically the turtle`s shells, can get damaged, and without a fully functioning shell, the turtle is unable plunge to get food, and subsequently dies unnecessarily.   OdySea is committed to supporting a variety of programs, including the sea turtles, as well as other local, regional, and global level programs, including educational programs to inspire guests about aquatic life conservation, and what they`re doing to make the world a better place today.   Right now, they are hosting a Save the Sharks conservation and educational exhibit where they go over the killing of sharks every year and what is done with the fins.   They look at the depletion of sharks and how it impacts the ocean, while educating guests about the harsh realities to make advocates out of the attendees.   For those wishing to get involved, they feature sign up portals on their website platform.  I`ve seen many naysayers make negative comments about having sea creatures in the desert. That`s hogwash. The people at OdySea are extremely committed to the preservation of the sea creatures currently there and are EXTREMELY passionate about making a difference.  I met several members of the staff who care desperately and work tirelessly to make sure of their survival and to rescue others. OdySea is clearly a refuge for sea creatures that would otherwise perish.   I didn`t expect that aspect of OdySea, and perhaps others are not aware of that either.  I liked the attention to detail throughout OdySea. Even the restroom has viewing windows of the shark habitat.  CONCLUSION  I like OdySea and I`m glad I went, but it`s clearly more for families and children.  The front window staff is a bit unfriendly/aloof, but the rest of the staff bent over backwards to make my visit enjoyable.  3/5 RECOMMEND  OF NOTE  *Plenty of parking out front.  *OdySea is in the back of the complex.  *Package deals available.  *For more information: odyseaaquarium.com<27<5<2018<22<55<24

From Jones to Durango along the 215 I watched them nearly cause four accidents.   Complete morons, especially in a van wrapped with the company logo.   When I called to report it, they talked back to me, tried to convince me it was a different company (the van is fully wrapped in a branded exterior), and didn`t seem to make any note or otherwise care at all.   Seems to be a callous disregard to the safety of others.   First I`d heard of the brand, the only thing I know of them, and - to my mind - a reason to take your business elsewhere.<18<9<2019<1<37<36

This cozy little restaurant bar didnt look like much outside but inside felt just like home. My girlfriend and I ordered a total of 4 things, a baked potato chip poutine dish, two alcoholic drinks and a nice rich chocolate dessert. Total was around $35 bucks.   I have to say that the quality of the food dish was top notch. I`m not a fan of cheese but I think tonight, I might have changed my mind. The baked potato poutine dish came in very hot and the potatoes were nice and crispy covered with cheese, bacon, tomato and other garnishes. The best part was the amount of cold sour cream on the side to balance the temperature heat. 10/10 for this dish. Great size for 2 to share!  The chocolate dessert was also very good quality as well. It came in a dish with a nice slab of rich very pure and heavy chocolate. It was accompanied with two perfectly balanced biscuits which tasted perfect with the slab of yummy rich chocolate. The portion for this was perfect for the two of us as well.   I have to say that the service from this place was top notch. I used to be a waiter and I don`t think I could have done as good as a job as the gentleman that served me tonight. He took his time to explain the dishes to us and was very accommodating and had a lot of positive energy coming out of him. If I could, I would give him 6 stars for his work. Keep up the good work!  This is a great place to go for a date and comfortable conversation. I would definitely be back again soon since my girlfriend seemed to really like this place as well.<4<2<2015<6<50<7

Surprisingly enough there wasn`t much of a wait for a table and we were seated within about 10mins of arrival. Our waitress was right over for our drink order and back in no time for food order. The location always has a decent selection of local brews and I enjoyed a sycamore mountain candy(yum!). Our food order was out about 10 mins later, which was good because the kids don`t typically enjoy waiting too long to eat! They both got the kids ribs, which they devoured with the help of some of the Queen City bbq sauce. Our meals came out with decent temps and were ready to eat upon arrival. The entire staff was great, from the GM who interacted with our kids and came and checked on our food, along with the waitress as well who checked on us a few times. All in all we had a decent experience here. We have visited about 3-4 times now and the food and service is good enough to have us back again. The only reason I didn`t give 5 stars here was the pricing. It is a bit expensive for meals and sides for a family 5.<23<9<2019<17<31<24

I`ve shopping at Sprouts and Trader Joe`s, but today I needed marshmallow cream for a recipe, so there you go.   I wandered a bit and picked up a few more things I needed for a staff breakfast on Monday, then I remembered I needed something to put the fruit on. In the summer seasonal aisle, I found some oval plastic platters marked down from $3.99 to $1.20, so I scooped up four of those, very pleased.   I went to check out, and the platters rang up at regular price. I said, '"Oh, those are on sale,'" and she completely ignored me and gave me my total. I said again, '"Those platters are marked down in the seasonal aisle.'" She lazily picks one up, flips it over, and says, '"There`s no sale tag,'" and repeats my total.   I say to her, '"Can you please have someone check?'" I`m paranoid about sales tags and always check the description and the item number to avoid embarrassing moments like this. She says, '"We`re really busy.'" I said, '"There`s one person in line behind me and he`s still unloading. Can you please call and have someone go check?'"   She then says, '"Oh, honey, no, they`re not on sale.'" I said, '"Then just take them off, please'", which she did. I SHOULD have hollered for a manager or gone back and checked myself, but it was ultimately my fault for even being IN a Fry`s, so at that point I just wanted out of there.   As I was walking away, the cashier says to the bagger, '"People try that ALL THE TIME,'" and I kept walking and thinking '"Try WHAT?'" when it occurred to me that she just effectively accused me of trying to steal from the store by getting a deal I didn`t deserve. I hate this store. I hate their customer service. I hate their grumpy faces. I am never stepping foot in this Fry`s again.  Edited for a typo"<29<7<2017<18<29<32

I was staring at a pizza box wondering if it was mine but thought '"surely they would call my name if it was my order, right?'"

We asked her if she could Change the the other big screen to the game she said no! Literally one other booth in the ENTIRE restaurant and no one was watching girls volleyball. She then proceeded to ACTUALLY SIT IN THE BOOTH WE ASKED FOR! while Shooting the shit with her friend drinking coffee. I`m sorry but for someone who`s been in the industry for a long time a '"Hostess'" is suppose to greet guests not sip on coffee and play on their phone in a booth. Also, she then sits 4-teenagers in the other booth we asked for!

We had to show IDs before entering, which I thought was kinda odd and unnecessary but so be it. There were maybe five hostesses at the front, and they told us it was going to be a 30 min wait. We waited near the stand and when over 30 minutes had passed, we went up to double check, and they seated us absentmindedly but immediately. I was also confused because the indoor dining area was pretty empty.  We got flights ($1.75 per = $7 for the flight). Our faves were the kilt lifter and peach ale. However, there was beer sloshed all over the beer slate, and the glasses were 3/4 full at best. Our waiter said the bartender spilled when he was filling then, but that didn`t add up in my head?? We also got burgers, which were alright but nothing special.  I really wanted to like this place because I had heard good things, but it  really wasn`t all that great. If I do want Four Peaks beer, I`ll opt to get it away from the source.<28<7<2019<0<30<58
SnPeY8xjBRpQJlHmSjFBoQ<O-_hDLPC4dWi-VJZAlTs2g<LjwVx0P37xXSNZaVUQkqxQ<1<3<3<0<"We came here yesterday (8/25/19) Never thought I would have to write a review about a movie theatre but the experience was SO bad I had to write about it.   There was only ONE person working the ticket booth and to make it worse, he was the slowest employee I`ve ever seen in my life. We waited 20 minutes in line when it should`ve been less than 3 minutes tops. He was not even trying to hurry despite all the people lined up. We had yellow tickets (tickets you can trade in to see any movie, kinda like a gift card). So we wondered if we could use them at the ticket machine instead of having to wait in line.  So I went inside to ask someone if this was possible, there was a female employee who saw me and instead of politely asking me what I needed help with, she BARKED at me, '"OUR COMPUTERS ARE DOWN. YOU HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE'" I then informed her that that was not what I was here for and asked her if I could turn in the yellow tickets at the machine. Then she said no.  I understand that they can`t help that the computers were down at the moment, but for the love of common sense, don`t bark at a customer assuming what they`re going to ask you.  Went back in line and waited forever. Finally when we got inside, no greeting or any sort of communication from the employee who checks the ticket. Boredom on her face and you could tell she didn`t want to be there.  Never had bad service at a movie theatre before.  And of course, the popcorn was cold, and the  bathrooms were DISGUSTING."<27<8<2019<1<54<20
Feo475vueIL6TdSnwSuiPA<5VA6pfDEDDMYG0IeGk8OMQ<xfWdUmrz2ha3rcigyITV0g<3<2<2<5<During this Vegas trip, I wanted to try one of the celebrity chef restaurants.  Since we were seeing a show at Planet Hollywood, we decided to wait in line at Gordon Ramsay Burger.  The first thing you`ll see is this large glass case that has a line of fire in it.  That is the side of the restaurant that you need to line up against.  As we were waiting in line, a staff member asked us how many people were in our party but never asked us for our name.  When we asked her how long the wait would be, she responded 35 minutes.  Wrong.  It was over an hour that we were waiting in line.  The line took so long that we technically didn`t even have enough time to place our order once our server came to the table.  He said the kitchen was backed up and that it would take at least 30 minutes for the burgers to be made.  Ugh.  So as a compromise for waiting in line for so long, we ordered a bunch of appetizers-hummus, poutine, and duck poppers.   After our order was put through, our server came back and told us the kitchen caught up and that he could put in our burger order if we wanted it still.  We decided to split one burger since we had already ordered the rest of the food.  The food itself was just okay. We ordered the blue cheese burger, which wasn`t anything special. The patties were smaller than I expected and it wasn`t as flavorful as I would have hoped. The poutine has smoked meat which was good but was a very heavy dish and we couldn`t finish it.  The duck poppers were okay- not sure where the duck was... perhaps the dunking sauce? And you can`t really go wrong with hummus, pita and vegetables.  For the amount of time we had to wait, I wasn`t thrilled about the food or the hype.  The only reason this place is getting 3 stars is because we had a great server who did his best to get out our food ASAP so that we could make our 7pm show.<29<9<2019<22<5<47

The hotel cannot be missed as it is iconic and huge.  It was easy to find via GPS with lots of good signage including their self-parking garage (above ground). Their parking garage is huge and there are conveniently located escalators and elevators within reach from where you parked.  However, on this particular occasion/visit some of their elevators and escalators were not working. (-1)  From the parking garage to the hotel and the many different levels, it could be a little confusing especially for us as we were new in town.  Thankfully the facilities had convenient map layouts around the place.  The hotel was immaculate and spotless and well maintained.  Despite the large throngs of people in the casino, which we had to pass through to get to the show, it wasn`t difficult to find where the show was and where we were going.  Staff were friendly and helpful in helping to point us in the right direction when we got lost a couple of times.  On a future visit to Vegas, I would most definitely love to return here for a stay in one of their suites.<18<8<2018<23<27<44

If you come into the casino area through the parking garage it is to your left as soon as you enter the casino, right next to the poker room.   I had been out roaming around the Strip all day, checking out all the casinos and gambling. Let me tell you spending hours at a Blackjack table makes you hungry. It was getting late and I was going to meet my wife after her business meetings. I wanted something quick so I thought I`d just try something back at the hotel.  The aroma of this place hits you as soon as you enter the area from the garage and it kinda pulls you in. The location here was a great idea. The person who took my order was really nice. I ordered a burger, fries and a beer, Budweiser of course. I`m not a big light beer fan but they didn`t have regular Budweiser. By the way, there isn`t that much of a difference in calories between a light beer and a light beer so stick to the regular.   Here is a little tip on beer purchasing at a casino too, the beer here is cheaper than at a casino bar.   So my meal comes up with in a decent amount of time. It looks yummy and believe me it was. It`s call '"The original grass fed burger'" and maybe there is something to that because it was delicious. The fries were good too. The price was reasonable as well definitely get the combo meal. This is a great burger option."<31<8<2019<11<26<26

East Coast I think, maybe a little brash, which I always get along with BUT I can see where some people might interpret as rude.  Surely not a bundle of joy...but that`s alright.  I wasn`t in for a massage.  Nonetheless, I was reminded of that Brady Bunch episode with the car.  Where the father teaches the son '"Let the buyer beware'".  So my fellow Yelpers...be aware.  I wanted to send a purse to my mother for her birthday in Chicago.  I planned accordingly, and had plenty of time.  So the slowest ground route was fine.  I told them this.  I didn`t need it insured.  They knew this also.  Finally, out of the multiple options they claim to have, the '"most affordable'" was over A HUNDRED BUCKS!  Yes...about as much as the purse.    I felt slightly rushed.  In fact, Mike had already started taking it in back before I formally acknowledged that I was OK with this raping.  I asked the lady if that could really be the price?  She confirmed that this was as low as I could get it there with them.  I said '"Would it be anything close to this price at the Post Office?'".  She told me as if she was a seasoned politician,  '"It`ll be pretty close.'".    No numbers.  No percentage of difference.  Just a line of BS to get me to go along with this molestation.  Needless to say, I told Mike to bring my package back.  He did, without acknowledging me or even looking in my direction.  It was as though I beat him in a hand of poker and I was no longer of any use to him.  I went elsewhere and got it sent with tracking and insurance for considerably less.  Full service also.  NOT THE POST OFFICE.  So I didn`t get any less customer care at the other facility that didn`t try to violate me like this.  Its obviously literally the Wild West with these places.  You presume that they are competitive, but they are not.  And I can simply tell, that this place gets away with whatever they can.  I don`t treat my clients like that, and I sure as heck won`t tolerate it with the people that I share my good business with.  So often we want to support family owned places.  But not when they treat their clients like this.    Once again, over $100.00 to send a simple 2 pound purse to Chicago within 5 days.  These guys are full of ship.  My mom is worth it.

Simply want to talk to one of the reps who quoted me the price to understand the discrepancy. Very displeased with the lack of customer service at this store.<14<10<2019<17<33<45
Y8r0Paz5XhpQEvLgQxI5Dw<SPI7O1GKZTvJhiXNFj81Eg<uCi2ropZuhG4XVcMDaurAw<4<1<1<1<so ive been to other locations and this one was ok. the atmosphere was good and customer service. but when i received my food my sandwiches looked alot smaller than usual less meat and avocado. also the french  fries were very soggy not crispy at all and they were hot like if they were heated in the microwave. i told the server she let me switch jt to another side without any issue which was pleasant. the food was overall good other than the fries. the watermelon juice we had was very good! i would have gave it a 5 star if the fries were cooked fresh and the portion of food was a bit larger. especially paying $36 for two to eat lunch these two issues shouldnt happen at all. hope this improves. i really enjoy rachels kitchen when craving a gourmet cafe type sandwich! i recommend it :-)<14<4<2019<21<8<29

We went on a Friday evening at 7 and it was busy but there were tables available. Staff were friendly and service was very quick in terms of bringing us water, taking our order and bringing our food out.   1) lemongrass chicken wings - on the sweet side but wow the wings were TENDER, like falling apart. I wish it was a bit spicier and crispier but they were good nonetheless.  2) Penang curry - tasty, not very spicy and more than enough sauce. Service with a side of jasmine rice.  3) pad Thai with beef - pad Thai was a little ketchup-y and sweet, I prefer a more savoury pad Thai but it was still good. My only gripe is that the beef was extremely dry and chewy - maybe I`d try chicken or shrimp next time.   The bill came to about $41 before tip which is not bad considering we had a ton of leftovers for 2 people.<12<10<2019<17<46<18

Perfectly seasoned, just spicy enough, and fantastic mix of textures (crispy chicken, firm-white-gooey-yolk boiled egg, perfectly cooked noodles). I know ramen broth is sorta considered unhealthy, but I couldn`t stop myself from drinking every last drop.  Beer selection is highly curated; it`s not a large selection (maybe 10 different choices), but they`re all fantastic. Dogfish Head sour I got was one of the best I`ve had.  First visit was fantastic. Second visit, I found my ramen to be a little lacking in seasoning, and I had to add quite a bit of the MSG and ramen pepper provided on the table to bring the Unami factor up. This one was done perfectly and I didn`t add a drop of anything to it.  It`s a small selection compared to a couple of the other ramen shops in town, but what they have, they execute well. Hope they stick around for the long haul.<22<10<2017<4<30<4

4nLkJfZtmcs-P1Db1vVxNQ<wuys3NiY4sqyb1XbPOY8hw<eEo0PlZudD4MrOhxNJabVA<1<0<0<0<I signed a lease with the previous management, and the apartment was filthy. Found out from the neighbor that the previous tenant used the place as some sort of whore house and made drugs there. This didn`t bother me, I cleaned up and made it my home. Then Chamberlin and Associates took over and things were going really well. I love the girls in the office and always had a pleasant experience if I ever needed to go down there to talk to them. Had no complaints, minus some baby roaches here and there which wasn`t a big deal. Minor incidents here and there, but overall I was very happy. At the end of my lease, I had no choice but to not renew due to personal reasons which I won`t disclose. And this is where the problem happens. This why I`m leaving a one star review. Upon moving out, I was told that I would get my deposit back within 14 business days. Before I knew it, it had been over a month and I never received it. I called and spoke to Brandon who was less than helpful in every way. After finally getting him to tell me what happened with my deposit, he informed me that I wasn`t getting anything back. This made me furious. I wanted to know why and he told me that all of it was used to cover a cleaning bill, painting the apartment, and a very large water bill. I left that apartment sparkling clean, there was no damage to the paint, and as for the water bill. He claims that I didn`t pay it, when I have proof that I did. When I asked for the bill for these, he handed me a written statement that he wrote up with the information on it. I wanted to see the statements from the companies and he couldn`t give them to me. Not only was there no communication regarding my deposit until I contacted him, he was probably hoping I would forget about it. I would have been proud to give this place a four or five star review if it weren`t for the unprofessional asshole who clearly likes money too much.<21<10<2019<6<58<3

Making the reservation through Yelp helped too.   The food took quite a long time to come out (about 45 minutes) and the side dishes were lukewarm. We did order (to share) the 4 lb T-bone steak that was about three inches thick...so this may not be the norm.   One of the guys I was with is still kicking himself for not ordering the seafood bouillabaisse that looked and, was reported by one of the other groups, to have been phenomenal.   Service overall could be improved (2 stars); it seemed the servers were overwhelmed. The ambiance is very nice, but a little dark. They had a live piano and sax duet that might have been a bit loud if you were sitting near it.  The bar area looked very appealing but we did not try it.<23<10<2019<15<4<57

I went with a co-worker, who had ordered first and had already paid for her meal, otherwise I would have walked out.  The counter staff was unpleasant and seemed annoyed at being asked any questions.  When I asked for well-done fries, I was told that they can only do the fires one way, and one way only.  The manager came over and likewise, denied my request to have fries cooked 20-30 seconds longer in the fryer.  I then asked for the number to their corporate office and a pen so I could write it down on my receipt, and the manager said he didn`t know the number and he didn`t have a pen.  The service was lousy, which was unfortunate, because the burger was good.  Not the best I`ve ever had, but better than most fast food.  I would not recommend this place.  Go to The Habit, where they have better customer service.<21<1<2018<2<14<51

I put initials for the pets and smoking without haste but had an issue with the damage to rooms part. When I inquired, the check in person told me that this is a huge hotel with 1 maintenance guy the damages should be noted. So by putting my initials on it, I will be responsible for any damages to the room. So I will the room inspector checking for damage that was missed out by the maintenance guy? Absurd!  Anyway the stay was good, rooms were a bit tight, lampshade was stained, shower was ok. Tap pressure was high (water shoots out and splashed everywhere).   Breakfast was so so, the usual scrambled eggs, sausages, fruits, juices, coffee, breads & waffles. The ambience was very stark, cold, no carpeted flooring.

Prior to purchasing, she called and talked to Sudan`s brother who said she could stay at the camp to watch, as to not leave a 5 year old with strangers. She called a couple days before the camp and spoke to Susan to confirm one more time. Susan agreed and said that was perfectly fine. Upon arrival, Susan called my mom a liar, and said she was not allowed to stay at the camp as it was a liability, but she could come back 30 minutes before the camp was over. My mom reminded her of the conversation they shared days before and Susan denied it. My mom told her she did not feel comfortable leaving my 5 year old nephew because he did not know anyone and wouldn`t feel comfortable. Susan still would not let my mom stay. My mom and nephew left, disappointed and sobbing because they could not participate. This was a surprise for my nephew and he was SO excited. I have never been so disappointed with customer service in my life. Susan also said '"well, you leave him at school with strangers so what is the difference?'" The difference is that ALL teachers and staff at school are fingerprinted, licensed and have background checked. This statement is so ignorant. We have requested a full refund from Groupon and will be sharing this terrible experience with everyone we know as well as sharing online in an effort to prevent other people from dealing with the same thing.

After having visited nearly every BBQ place in Arizona, no place holds a candle to this Bobby Q. Chileen`s on 17 and Thee Pits again, are close, but not close enough.  However, we really aren`t that enamored with the Bobby Q`s location on 27th avenue. I have fond memories of this location when the restaurant was Bobby McGee`s. It was my daughters` favorite place to go when it was date night with their dad.  But, the area isn`t the best anymore, nor is the parking.  Therefore, when we were craving BBQ on Friday evening, we opted to travel to Mesa to sample their succulent offerings in much more accessible surroundings.  We definitely weren`t disappointed.   The restaurant has plenty of parking, even for a Friday night. It wasn`t because the restaurant wasn`t busy either. There was quite a crowd eating there that night. The only thing that might be improved is the rather extensive amount of wood smoke we could smell on the outside. Fortunately it didn`t make its way indoors. For those that are sensitive to smoke, it would be nice if they could solve that small problem.   The wood frame house structure of the restaurant is well appointed inside. We had great seats in the center of the room so we could see all the folks. The greeters in front were quite friendly and took us right to a table.    Another friendly person was our server Harrison. He created rapport right away with us. He was funny, and enthusiastic about his job. We felt well taken care of. Our food and drinks came out promptly, without any errors.   As for the food. My wife had the 8 ounce sirloin, and I had the smoasted chicken. For an appetizer, we had the q-rolls.  The q-rolls are basically mini chimichangas with tender brisket inside. We were given two sauces to dip the roll into. One was the amazingly sweet and tangy barbeque sauce, and the other was a zesty buffalo type sauce. We decided the dish was a great start.  Before we got those, we were given Bobby Q`s amazing cornbread cakes. They are round pieces of heaven. I have to admit that I`m a corn bread addict, and these little cakes are just the ticket to sooth the craving.  My smoasted chicken was amazing. It`s both smoked and roasted, then covered in Bobby Q`s amazing barbecue sauce. It would say it had a nice tough of originality.  My wife`s steak seemed a lot bigger than 8 ounces, and it was quite tender. She also had a generously sized baked potato and delicious roasted corn. I also had the roasted corn and have to say that it`s some of the sweetest and crunchiest I`ve tasted.   To top it all off, at the end they gave us a bag of warm cinnamon donuts. They reminded me of beignets, and they were delicious.  We definitely be back again and again.<29<1<2019<4<59<22

Then today, I`m asked if using an food card or paying cash. So I said okay, let me see how this plays out, so I answered, had me pay for the meal in advance before preparing my order. Then I deliberately sat, eating, watching as numerous other customers come in afterwards, just waiting for them to be asked the same question, at least 9 others were service, and not one time has any been asked food card or cash. Now because I`ve been pretty regular here, have noticed numerous times how different the blacks are treated from all others, and it`s not the best.

It`s unfortunate that while I expressed that the issue in my home has been ongoing since March/April (and I moved in June), the technician did not only NOT conduct a '"thorough'" investigation (unless you include a couple seconds cursory flashing of a flashlight at one corner of my daughter`s bed frame thorough) of my home, but summarily dismissed me when I reiterated that I felt it would be prudent to treat not only the perimeters of every room (which I moved all the furniture from as well as vacuumed per the instructions in the prep sheet) but EVERYWHERE HE COULD ACTUALLY SPRAY WHATEVER AMOUNT OF CROSSFIRE HE HAD AVAILABLE. His communication was not exact on whether he would do so (he seemed pretty set on doing whatever he deemed appropriate in his 6 years of experience) since I had to leave to go to work but yeah, not impressed, at all, for $426 and will not, absolutely, be paying any more for what I found today to be sub-par service for the price."<8<9<2018<20<34<19

As a tenant as opposed to being an owner, my direct interaction with the HOA is limited. In those interactions, I have experienced nothing but friendly, prompt and professional service. Katherine Greene has helped me a handful of times getting our key fobs updated and she has always been great. On my most recent visit, Faye (spelling?) greeted me at the front desk and chatted with me as I waited. I also cannot forget to mention Tony, the maintenance/grounds manager.

I don`t usually write negative reviews, because it`s unnecessary.  However, if it`s a public safety issue I would want to be informed.  My 2 year old got food poisoning twice from the ready to eat food in this store. And we were able to determine that it was the food here since the first and second time the only other thing he had eaten was toast at home.   Then after giving the store another try we bought lunchmeat sliced from the deli. The label read sell by 10/28 and it was purchased at 11am on 10/30.  Upon calling I was told that maybe their sticker machine wasn`t dating and nobody fixed it, or it '"should'" say something else, or that they simply didn`t know why that happened. I was told to come in for a refund. When I arrived the lady didn`t know what to do and after 15min of waiting was told the manager had gone home and I should come back the next day.   I called before going in the next day and was told the manager wasn`t there. Christina was extraordinarily rude and after telling me she was trying to help other customers as well put me on hold to find a manager. She came back twice saying she was unsuccessful and when I said I`d wait, she sarcastically commented '"what do you want me to do? Drag a manager to the phone?'"  Perhaps you should work at home in solitude Christine, where your customer service skills are useful. The health department should be made aware of their negligence.  Poor customer care, poor food safety practices. Save your money and your health and head to Trader Joe`s."<31<10<2019<19<15<8

They let us bring our pooch on their patio which was a major plus! They immediately brought him water and us chips & delicious fresh salsas (red & green). Their salsa is AMAZING. I wanted to drink it. ;) Next, of course we treated ourselves to a pitcher of margaritas! They were a little sweet for my liking but i`m a picky margarita drinker. The definitely cured the craving! And of course, we got an order of guacamole for the table to share --- and it was so YUM! You must get it.   For my meal, I ordered the taco & cheese enchilada combo plate with a side of sour cream. Their sour cream is magical! It has secret spices in it that almost taste like ranch! (won my heart right there!). Overall, I was SUPER satisfied with this meal and went home ready for a nap!

Luckily it wasn`t a super hot day, so the lack of shade did not bother us. In fact it was overcast, so it was nice and cool.   The climb up to the top was not easy, I was huffing and puffing for a while. I also ran into a snake who totally hissed at me, that was scary. There was alot of bugs and critters, so do be careful. The trail was not super busy, I only carried a small bottle of water and that was plenty, I would recommend carrying alot more on a hot day.

rP_0t4xHMUydpesOPJ6FdQ<z4OUVgpC99LbWAeb97oK8g<fYCRrN3sIQnioWMzF8miIA<3<2<0<0<"Stereotypical car '"stealership'" experience.  I had made an appointment to check out a car, but the sales associate that it was originally scheduled with was not available. However, I got lucky and ended up with Ashley. She was very helpful and friendly, which prevented me from giving this dealer a one star rating. I had my daughter with me and Ashley helped me put the car seat the car I test drove. Ashley also entertain my daughter.   The rest of the dealer experience is a different story. I didn`t even negotiate with the advertised price on the website, but I did try to have two things removed from the sale: one was a redundant item and the other useless.   The first item is a KARR security system for about $478. The sales associate and manager tried to sell me on this saying that it kept the car from starting if someone tried to steal it. Well, the car already comes with a great security system from the factory that includes an immobilizer, so this '"KARR'" system is totally unnecessary. The factory system is actually better. Depending on the subscription, the factory security system can be used to track your car. Shoppers--do your homework on KARR.  The other item the sales manager refused to remove was window etching for $189. I don`t remember exactly what it was called but it had '"DOT'" in the name. This is totally useless. The vehicle`s VIN is not actually etched on the window. I`ve asked my insurers in the past, both old and current insurance companies, and neither have discounts for window etching. Shoppers--please do research on this. If you want this feature, it`s better to buy a kit online for $25 and etch the actual VIN yourself.  The manager asked if those two things were the only thing preventing me from buying the vehicle tonight and I told him yes. The manager refused to remove the two items and further argued for the items saying that the dealership worked hard to inspect the car and doesn`t want their car stolen. This is more rubbish. The dealership takes extra precautions like barricading the entrance with vehicles to prevent theft, car keys locked away, the dealership is on a very busy street that is often patrolled by police, and I`m sure the building has a security system. I`ve never read or heard of a car being stolen from a new car dealership that Sahara CJDR is on.   The manager said that the price the dealership charges for the security system and window etching is the lowest in town. I told him that I`ve had that taken out of a deal and he tells me he`s worked at many places in town and those items are part of the deal. The manager has either worked at only car '"stealerships'" and is unaware that dealers can and do take that out of deals, or is lying. My wife`s SUV was bought without window etching and without a dealer installed security system. The leased vehicle that I turned in a couple months ago was acquired without window etching or dealer installed car security system. Same goes for my previous car that was bought in 2013.  I did mention to the manager that I didn`t negotiate the asking price and also added that the dealer probably got the car at a good price and marked it up with a healthy profit baked into the asking price. I was told not to focus on what the dealership got the car for but how nice the car is. What`s the basis I`m supposed to use then? I figure it`s like most things people buy: cost of goods plus perceived added value by seller equals reasonable selling price.  I didn`t negotiate further and left. I suspect the '"finance manager'" situation is typical car stealership. Shoppers--please ask about the finance manager`s past roles. I bet it was a sales associate/consultant. A long time ago when I bought my first car, I did my due diligence and did my homework before buying a car. I learned the finance manager, finance office, back office, or whatever the dealership calls it, is usually the best sales person offering all sorts of heavily marked up vehicle and/or loan protection.   This experience has further reinforced my like for how Tesla sells cars. They own all their '"dealerships'" and is known for excellent customer service. I believe if auto manufacturers owned dealerships, the vehicle acquisition experience would be much better overall.   I`m summary: Ashley is a star, one star is the lowest rating I can give the dealership, I didn`t experience the service department so another star for the benefit of the doubt, and that`s how I came to my three star rating. It`s a stereotypical car dealership."<7<9<2019<4<49<5

He said that he had a lot of good service and food there so I thought I would take some friends. Boy, was that a mistake.   This place got one extra star because we were seated very quickly. The Cactus Club across the street was packed and so we decided on trying this location.   1) The service was terrible. Throughout the night, we barely saw our waiter. I don`t know if it was because they were understaffed or if it was because it was after the mall closed and everyone was tired, but it was terrible.   2) Food was slow. We waited quite a long time for our food. we thought they had forgotten our order and asked. they said it was on its way out a couple of times.   3) We were sharing some meals as there were kids. Cutlery and sharing plates came out dirty. We had to ask for replacements and as our wait staff wasn`t coming around, it took some time.   The food was actually pretty good and we always go to the Keg up in Richmond Hill where we live or in Brantford, but the one at Sherway just isn`t up to par.

Initially they told us it might take 25 mins.. and it wasn`t to busy, at some point we were the only ones waiting.. My relative who had a recent surgery had to wait with me which I have also mentioned to the staff but they didn`t even care.. At the end they didn`t even say they were sorry for the wait. The only reason I am giving 1 star is there is no '"zero'" star option. I don`t recommend this pharmacy to anyone."<14<11<2019<21<42<53

I`ve been here for 5 times over the last couple of years and the food is always superb.    I always have an enchilada sometimes I`ll have a few tacos and I always have their amazing fresh chips salsa and guacamole. Their margueritas are unbelievable too.

mxZXewzwNI7hqZjy-_kG8Q<A3OQYz_RFov5SHvKyuiCng<Fq3awDRLUB4SZMQyrRjj5A<1<1<0<0<"This place is an unorganized mess. I was going to use Sweet Dees as a baker for an upcoming party. My friend and I placed our order and put a deposit, however as soon as we put the deposit down, Sweet Dees stopped responding. Initially the owner told me she would deliver the cake to my house in Scottsdale for free. Then a week later they gave us a pick up time for us to get the cake from their shop. We emailed them asking for clarification, and received no response. I emailed again and still received no response. We also wanted to discuss the color of the flowers on the cake and a topper and asked clear questions in our emails. We were worried as we were purchasing a $150 cake, and Sweet Dees would not even respond to an email.  I called today and the owner`s daughter told me they would deliver the cake to my house free of charge the day of the party.  She also clarified that they could put the topper (that I would provide and drop off a few weeks prior) on the cake. I felt relieved and thought we may have cleared things up. However, the owner called me a few minutes later to let me know that they would not deliver. When I said that her daughter told me she would deliver the owner said '"yeah, we will deliver for $25'". It appears that not only does this mother daughter duo lack communication skills with their customers, but also with each other.   The only reason I gave this place one star is because they did refund my deposit (and because Yelp does not allow zero stars)."<5<11<2019<21<37<44

That is where our 5 star experience started. We were scheduled with another '"Large & Popular'" Las Vegas Plumbing Company; after 5 hours and several calls, we were no closer to getting our water leak between floors fixed. Found Precision Plumbing online and contacted them. Within One Hour they were assessing the project. Chris and his colleague were very professional. With the limited logistical information we could provide, they found the leak, developed a strategy to bypass the existing line, reroute a new line, cap off the old line and do all of this working with a concrete slab and concrete wall separating the floors and there is to be NO pipe showing upon competition. The price they quoted us after an extensive amount of diagnosis time was very fair. The repair took a couple days and is complete.  Our faith in Precision Plumbing was well placed. We are not grateful for this Burst-Pipe event, however; the good from it is we know who to call when we have plumbing problems."<19<8<2018<2<32<25

Here is the deal - 5 stars for the food!!!   1 star for the customer service.  You are lucky if they even acknowledge you - let alone be friendly to you.  Unfortunately I doubt this place will last because who wants good food being treated like you are unimportant to their livelihood.  It seems like a family ran joint but they could care less about their customers.  The walk up to a counter with nobody present and wonder what you are supposed to do will catch up to them.  Phat Phrank - If you are reading this the 2 ladies working both times we visited are failing you.

Pretty simple, I call there and ask for something and they say they are calling me back and never do. My guess is thus - what I`m asking about are not big ticket items - such as retro-fitting a shaft so I can use it along with another shaft in a TS-3 driver. And so on. Looks like they`re really only interested if you`re going to be one of the many suckers (hacks) that pays three grand for a set of clubs before they can even hit it on the course. Better players know better and that`s why I will continue to look - elsewhere - for a shop in Vegas that really cares about the needs of good players - Aloha Golf is not it.   I`ve actually had much better response from the big box - PGA Superstore in Summerlin - surprisingly. They could not be more helpful.    Oh well ...<21<11<2019<7<17<13

As expected, my laptop was in pristine condition upon return. When I walked in the staff was pleasant. I expressed my previously posted feelings and they were kind enough to match the estimated time pricing. I still feel it was a bit expensive but after using my laptop for the past week I think it was definitely worth it. My laptop ran like new. The fans were lightly blowing and the start-up was quick. I was able to render a ten minuter video in less than a minute, everything was back to 4 years ago.

We loved going to the place in Shadyside, and were ecstatic when we learned that they were opening this place up in Fox Chapel. My wife and I have been enjoying their pizza for quite some time, and this was a very welcome addition to our repertoire of pizza establishments we love.  The dough is super nice - has a little stretch to it, and definitely picks up all the yumminess of the wood fired oven. You really can`t go wrong with any of their options - I love their Pizza della casa with arugula and Pizza del Re the most.  It`s a little chaotic on weekends, but it`s nice to see a new business bustling - I want them to succeed. I haven`t tried their gelato yet but it looks amazing.

Is it the best pizza in the city? Nope! But do I come here at 1230am to satisfy a late night pizza craving with their walk-in small pizza & drink special as opposed to getting a frozen pizza at the supermarket? You bet I do!

It`s not big so it can get crowded inside. The patio is much roomier.   It has some pretty good happy hour deals. It includes several $5 craft beers from local breweries. There`s also $6 New Amsterdam gin and vodka. It`s not any more expensive and is cheaper in fact than many of the casinos. They have a few items on the food menu. It`s mainly lighter fare like grilled cheese. They didn`t have much food that appealed to me.   It was a difference atmosphere than on Fremont. It`s much more family friendly.

Snooze is probably still number 1 in my book for best brunch food in Houston.   However, service quality was a bit off today. When we came in the restaurant, we stood at the front for maybe 5-10 minutes just waiting before there was actually a server to put my friend and I on the waiting list. There was no worker to organize the line, so many of us were clustered at the front not knowing what to do. Not a deal breaker, but just something to point out.

We came on a weekday around lunchtime and there wasn`t a wait. The service was great, while the food did take awhile to be prepared. They were prepared for us to split our foods, and the way they allow you to pay is genius.   We got the pancake flight and tried the pancake of the day (white chocolate chip pancake), chocolate chip, pineapple, sweet potato, peanut butter, and blueberry. My least favorite were sweet potato and pineapple but the pineapple was probably because I saved it for the end and was so full. These are very sweet, so treat them as desserts! My favorite was peanut butter, chocolate chip, and pancake of the day. Honestly, all the pancakes were great, even the ones that were my least favorite!!  I also split the Chile verde eggs Benedict with a friend and it was DELICIOUS! My portion was quite substantial- I think when they divide it into two, they double the Pico de Gallo and hash brown you get so both of the portions get enough to eat which is amazing. I definitely recommend this. My friend got the taco and the portion was generous also.   Edit: I returned on a Saturday and got pancake flights, this time trying the cannoli and French toast. I didn`t particularly like these. I also got a half portion of the Snooze Spuds deluxe and while it was tasty, I recommend the Chile Verde eggs Benedict as it has more for the same price.   Overall, I definitely recommend this place during the weekday for brunch and am looking forward to coming back.<18<12<2018<21<15<18

(I`m not one for massive dinner parties...) fancy yet cosy with lots of food and yummy cocktails !   MajesThé is definitely a new go-to on my list. I`m so glad I discovered this trendy bar hidden on University.   Cocktails: princess peach was amazing. Tasted like a fancy peach ice tea with lychee jelly at the bottom. 5/5 I think this might be my favourite cocktail of the year!!  Then I had the Debbie, think Irish coffee but with bubble tea instead. It was sooooo goood. First sips were great, a little sweet for me after that. Still a 5/5 because it was just so unique!   Food: so let me just put it out there that I`m a huge fan of bars that also serve quality food ! Im always in a rush to head out for drinks with friends and usually don`t have time to eat before.  Immediate star right there since bars like these can cater to my needs.   Sweet potato fries with Asian mayonnaise : crispy in the outside, soft and sweet on the inside. 5/5  Karaage chicken: this is my benchmark dish for a good Asian (Japanese/Korean/Taiwanese/fusion) and actually only have 1 or 2 places in mind that make the cut. MajesThé just became one of them. Generous pieces of chicken fried golden to perfection.  8/5 legit.   Taiwanese fried chicken: more like chicken popcorn with an Asian twist. wish i had spotted the plates sooner  5/5  Chicken bbq skewers: Omg.  Generous portions again, cooked perfectly and seasoned well. 5/5  Octopus bbq : really delicious sweet tangy flavours. A little too saucy for me. But still great 4/5   Tofu sticks: in comparison to the rest, not as impressive. But still good ,  I`m just not a tofu lover 3/5  Big thank you to the MajesThé staff for having us. Special shout out to Justin for his magic tricks... & for taking care of us ladies at the hungry table !   Risa & Mariko, this was such a success. Congrats!<27<11<2019<12<3<59

Everyone, including the owners panicked like a herd of gazelles on the African plains. Highly unprofessional and ratchet and then proceeds to have conversations about said roaches.

And they claim it was the new HOA company`s responsibility. Yet I have a registered account through their online portal that manages the withdrawls. So when I found out about the switch quite suddenly I tried to login to Osselaer`s portal so I can make sure those withdrawls are put to a stop and I can get the new HOA company paid on a timely manner. Well, of course the online portal is no longer working for me. Without any notice from Osselaer. And in the meantime I`m receiving email notifications about the pending withdrawl, etc. Contact Osselaer directly - and as we all know, it`s difficult to get a hold of whomever is managing your condo`s account - and the receptionist says, '"Yes, I did hear, but am not positive, about us no longer handling your condominium..'" So they can`t confirm it... Transferred to the '"accountant'" who says, oh don`t worry, we won`t be withdrawing anything, since we don`t handle your account anymore. Only to find out a few days later, another email stating that the withdrawl is taking place. I email the accountant again, confused since he told me it was taken care of. And he replies with '"Oh, well since it was through the online portal, that was your responsibility.'" Well, thanks for nothing. I tried to handle that through the online portal, so that I wouldn`t have to involve anyone over there at the company, including the '"accountant,'" but since all portals were no longer working for us residents, it was impossible to address this.  I have no idea what`s going on over there or who is managing things. But if you`re going to remove people`s access to your online portal that handles sensitive financial material, I think an email notification about the matter would be in order. And whatever system you have implemented, where access to the online portal has been removed for residents yet email notifications in relation to that online portal are still going out, is pretty poorly designed."<2<12<2019<18<45<13

Tanya met us close to the park, gave us instructions, fitted us with helmets and gave us info about the park along with a map, both printed and texted to our phone. Each bike had 3 cold bottles of water and a granola bar packed in a small bag on the handle bar. This bag had a map pocket that was perfect to hold our phones. We rode 24 miles in a little over 2 hours and were back to our vehicle before the heat of the day.    Everything went perfectly. Our bikes performed flawlessly. The power assist made all the difference. My wife and I are in our early 60s and we were concerned how we would do, not having ridden bikes in years, even decades in the case of my wife.  Other than a bit of a sore butt, I was amazed at how good I felt afterwards.   I would highly recommend this adventure to anyone in at least fair physical condition.  Go early and enjoy cooler temps, better lighting and clearer air quality for better photos.<18<8<2018<14<53<25

The third floor was dedicated to soldiers throughout Canada`s history. The rest of the castle was huge with libraries, garden observatory, bedrooms, sitting rooms, dining rooms, and main lobby with pianos and fireplaces. The towers are also accessible for those not afraid of heights and slim enough to fit up the small spiral staircases. My wife says the views are beautiful. Outside, the gardens are phenomenal with fountains and sculptures... a great place to take photos.  They have also added a huge bar room for events and in the basement a cafeteria and gift shop. Interestingly,  the walls on the lower level are lined with posters of movies that have scenes filmed at Casa Loma.

Wait times for service are often long and the staff seems to be short handed for the workload, but I accepted this because the location was convenient - which is not a good reason to settle on a service provider. I called today to see if the shingles vaccine was available and when told that it was, I asked how much it would cost and offered to reconfirm/update my insurance info as needed in order to understand my out of pocket expense. The pharmacist told me the cost could not be provided over the phone because they had to enter all my info in the computer with me there in person. Well, that sounds like BS to me and I explained that I would not come in without knowing the cost, but he offered no flexibility in his position. Well I called the CVS just down the road at Hunter Crossing, they had the vaccine, took my insurance info, told me what my out of pocket cost would be, said they would hold a dose for me and I plan to stop by next Monday to get the first of two injections.  There are too many other pharmacies willing to be transparent with their pricing for Walgreens to hide behind their bureaucracy and expect consumers to simply take it the way they want to dish it out.

s2kSDUgA62ioiKr0Evco7A<i8VpORo1f7OLvaelCU02DQ<SeNOJ2zYHziptxLuiRINLg<3<1<1<1<"I came here for Sunday brunch a few weeks ago. I really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere here, and I would have given 5 stars for just the food and the ambience alone.  The good:  Sunday brunch is around $40 per person, and with that, you get pastries, two courses, and unlimited dessert from the dessert buffet at the front of the restaurant, near the casino. We made a reservation and asked to be seated by the window, and we had an amazing, unblocked view of the fountains. Our request was accommodated, which I thought was very lucky since Sunday brunch here is decently popular. It was beautiful, and we got some very nice pictures too. We ordered the ribs, prosciutto board, and the chicken and egg dish. All of these were wonderful and quite filling, despite their small size. The pastries were very nice too. Then, we went to get dessert, and we got a few plates of chocolate-dipped strawberries, fruit, nutella crepes, and small cakes. One of them was a glitter-topped fruit tart. It was almost too pretty to eat!   The bad:  There were two things that made the difference between a 3-star and a 5-star review for me. First of all: the smell. The casino smelled mildly like second hand smoke, which is normal, but about 10 feet in from the host stand, where the bar and the couches are, it smelled like middle school gym locker rooms. Seriously, it had to either have been stale piss or a lot of sweaty clothes somewhere. Luckily it didn`t smell like that throughout the whole restaurant.   Secondly, the service. If I am going to pay $40 per person for brunch in a high-end restaurant in Vegas, not even including tip, I expect the service to be at least on par with random restaurants in the suburbs of LA. When we ordered, I asked the waiter to describe what the menu meant by '"quail eggs and smoked salmon'". I was like, is that on a plate? Does it come with anything, like bread? Is the quail egg cooked? Is it poached? Is it boiled? How many? This is not a standard dish so it`s harder to visualize what this is. I asked the waitress, and she was like '"quail eggs and salmon'". I didn`t order that, and chalked it up to maybe a language barrier. Whatever, not a big deal. But then, at the end, when we wanted to pay, we had a hard time flagging down our waiter. It took almost 30 min to get her attention, and I know this because we were waiting through 2 water shows that came 15 min apart. We were about to walk up to her and straight up ask her for the check. She seemed to have disappeared for a while, not sure where she went. The restaurant was about 60% full at the time, so there should have been no excuse for such a long wait. At least we were able to enjoy the view of the fountain through many water shows.   Finally, the staff, including waiters, busboys, and hosts/hostesses just seem to walk wherever they want, even right in front of guests. At a restaurant like this, I don`t expect to be cut off or walked in front of all the time, yet this consistently happened to us, whenever we got up for dessert or to use the bathroom.   I wanted to try this for dinner next time I went to Vegas, but I think I can have a better experience at a different restaurant if I`m going to drop this much."<12<12<2019<2<36<28
-Fj5RRxT_eJnu9hzQZSgdA<JxrX6Y-w1nd91OGvHHM-DA<o7F60cOVOk9fOM3WN2QjvA<1<0<0<0<"My name is Judith Ballard and I have been a believer and follower of Jesus Christ since the age of 15, I am now 61. Through the years of walking with Christ, I have seen my own revolution, growing from religious to righteousness, from being judgmental to learning to love unconditionally. My concern today is how we as believers tend to be the worst at showing the unbeliever the true love of Christ, and accepting all as Christ did. God so loved the world, not just the religious, or those that deemed themselves righteous, but the whole world who was judged under sin, and yet Christ died. Being a Christian University I would hope that the standard for the school would be to represent the love of God to all those that are open to attending a Christian College, knowing it is Christian, coming in, as a non-Christian. Unfortunately this is not the case for Arizona Christian University, who knowingly accepted a young lady who admitted she was not a Christian, was accepted, and enrolled, who was so excited to attend only to receive a call from Jason the head of admissions, whom after careful consideration has pulled this young lady`s enrollment. I was stunned and speechless, it almost brought me to tears. I am very familiar with this young lady whom I consider my own daughter, who has a better attitude than most young Christian youth I know. I would agree with her Mother who stated to Jason '"Do you know how this will affect her opinion of Christians and Jesus,'" this is not the true representation that The Lord Jesus Christ would have us as believers represent His love to the non-believer. Something went very wrong in this situation. Putting all else aside, is this how our Lord would have handled this? There was no explanation given to this family other than he has reconsidered the decision, this is a child, not a garment you change your mind about and return the purchase. I would think you would want non-Christians to enroll in your school in order to point them to Jesus. Basically, it would appear all are not welcome in your school, all are not excepted. The funny thing about this whole story is, the gymnastics coach contacted my young friend and told her she saw videos of her and was very interested in her coming to the college, and being a part of their gymnastics team. This is an egregious act.   Thank you"<12<12<2019<1<58<17
gV3OIJrXyklRPpeaEQYeEw<janMsyYEYQV5iNohlEIBlg<RCdWzJI0acxponN70QDRcw<4<1<0<0<We chose this hotel because it`s pet friendly so we had to pay the extra fees to bring our furbaby. We stayed for four nights. This place is slightly expensive but compared to other pet friendly hotels on the strip it was the best one for us. The hotel was quite and family oriented so we didn`t have to run into the young party crowd. The room was so spacious and clean. The area to allow our dog to relieve herself was small and they used artificial grass but it was good enough for our dog. The only concern I had and the hotel had no control over is how people in Vegas are so relaxed and open to smoke marijuana in public. It wasnt pleasant experience having to walk by people getting high and people were of all different ages too. Just like what other response, avoid touching  their fridge and mini bar bc they will charge you regardless even if you used the items or not. There`s a sensor and the moment the items were moved they will automatically charge you. Oh another concern is their bedroom doors are heavy and it`s very loud when the doors closes so it would startle our dog. Customer service was pleasant and they were attentive to us. The guys who helps with the luggage were a bit pushy and wouldn`t allow us to take the luaggge ourselves and they prefer to help us and I think it`s because they hopes to earn the tips for their help. Overall we would stay here again.<12<12<2019<7<7<55

A client told me about this new restaurant so I decided to try it out with my daughter. When we entered the restaurant it smelled of old grease frying which was a bit of a turn off. The staff was friendly. The wait to order was about 15 minutes.   I paid for my order and was surprise that it was $59. Well I should have asked what the market price was on the crab cake. It was $16.95. If I had known the price I probably wouldn`t have gotten it but I am glad I did because it was the best item we ordered.   The food took about 45 minutes to come out. We both got the grilled salmon and shrimp (one fried, one grilled) and Mac and cheese and garlic mashed potatoes. The most flavor we had was from the sides of special sauce and  mambo sauce. The mashed potatoes had absolutely no garlic. The Mac and cheese was HORRIBLE. The rice that came with it had absolutely no flavor. The salmon was good when I poured the mango sauce on it, it was a little dry. Most places ask if you want it well or med well. They didn`t so it was well done. The grilled shrimp had no seasoning, the fried shrimp had a good tasting breading. The crab cake was good but didn`t really have seasoning either.    I don`t know that I would give it another try. I could have spent less and got a better tasting meal. I don`t mind spending more for food, the taste just has to match the price!!!!!<13<12<2019<12<52<37

I ordered the pad kee mow at a level five and was not disappointed. Their crab wontons were also delicious- you could tell these were made fresh and not frozen. The only sad thing was they used jalapeños instead of Thai chili but I`m willing to overlook that because the flavor profile was delicious.   Ambiance is super cute- you wouldn`t expect it from looking at the small plaza area from the outside.  It`s worth the obnoxious drive down independence! I`ll be back to explore more of their menu!<18<3<2019<2<5<44

Checking in was a bit more tedious than The Kierland Westin Resort. Desk clerks had a bit more dry personality, but that`s ok.  There was more variety in pools! The lazy river moved quicker along with some extra perks (sprinkler fountains and water waves), which is probably why they don`t allow drinks on their river :( They also have a wave pool and some pretty huge water slides for those of you interested.  Another downside, nobody bothered to wait on us when we were seated, so we had to order drinks at the bar and then go over and order food at the dining court. Virgin-Daiquiri`s were super yummy!  Nachos were decent, cheese is questionable, & a bit pricey ($20+)  Probably a one-time experience for us =/<4<6<2018<20<0<21

Spending most of the 90s there in a gigantic 2 BR, 2 bath, I returned 6 years ago after a divorce to a huge 1 BR, 1 bath. Upon my return I was still captivated by the elegance and grandeur of a building from days gone by. Built circa 1930, the architecture is classically Art Deco - from the facade of the building to the lobby to the elevator doors - truly spectacular for those who appreciate this time period and style! All apartments have exposed hard wood floors, crown moulding, and most have faux fireplaces. I love my 1 BR which has an amazing East view of the city, and being in a higher floor, it`s like being in what I call my '"NY Loft'" at night!  Valet parking is available, a dry cleaning service, laundry room (with new washers & dryers!), and exercise room are all on premises. And once the doorman knows you, they will remind you that you have a package to pick up! Always friendly and courteous.

I spoke to Reily about a month ago and he was super chill and no pressure help. I came back in today and he was busy closing with another customer, but he went I got my Tucson set up to test drive and then introduced me to Jerermy (another one of the internet sales guys).  Jerermy was great, he stuck to the facts and did not BS around when it came down to negotiating prices and possibilities. This is my 7th new car (and 4th Hyundai), so I`m no stranger to the game; I did my research and knew what I wanted to pay and what I was willing to take for my trade in (Veloster).  These guys are professional AF, they do not belittle you or insult your intelligence in anyway (as you may get at other dealerships). The no hassle price is pretty great as it is - I`ve haggled down 5k in the past (which I thought was great), but these guys already have that taken care of in the no hassle price (off MSRP).  The no BS price is legit; it`s below the national avg. and below even USAA car buying service (for us military folk).<28<4<2017<5<32<39

cXm_0UAH4xUGDgS83LmlQQ<Y3gC9MD6jRRPABKzdRe57g<qzPTUBluPVzpWTqqTLGwjQ<1<0<0<0<Rainy day in Phoenix, so I thought I would order some soup and Sammy`s. At checkout my jaw dropped. $55 for 2 soups and half Sammy`s, 6 bagels and cream cheese and 2 pastries. I got an email stating my order was out for delivery @ 2:58, so I looked at the app that popped up after I placed my order and watch the driver go in the opposite direction of my house. Clearly she was delivering another order, all the while my cold Sammys are laying on top of my hot soup. I check 15 mins later and there she is puttering the wrong way. I call the restaurant and choose the manage option only to be on hold for 10 mins then I get disconnected. By this time the driver is now headed towards my house. She arrives @ 3;45pm, a good 47 minutes for my soup to get cold and my cold Sammy`s to get warm and wilted.She does not offer an apology for being 33 mins late past the time I was given. So I open the bag and yep soup is cold, I take one bite of the warm Sammy and say screw this. They can come back and pick this crap up, because I am not paying for it. I called back, again Put on hold, this time I tried a different prompt. AGAIN was disconnected after 10 mins, called again, same results. WTF? Who ever manages this place clearly is failing, how can you have an open business and not answer your phone 3 different times? It was well after the lunch rush? I then wasted more time sending them an email. Next call is to stop payment on the CC. FYI THIS WAS PANERA DELIVERY NOT UBER OR DOOR DASH.<20<11<2019<23<37<36

(Although, my husband disagrees, so I`m bumping my review up one star from what I would otherwise have given).  The pre-meal bread tasted like the dough came out of a can.  It didn`t taste fresh, and the accompanying sauce was just ok.  It tasted like a sauce I would`ve made on my own, and while I`d love to think I`m an amazing cook, my sauces just don`t have the same depth of flavor that I expect from a good Italian restaurant.  I ordered the baked penne, as many reviewers had mentioned enjoying the dish.  It was plain and not very cheesy, and it had definitely just been heated for a few seconds under the salamander.  So the cheese was melted, but not how it should be for a '"baked'" dish (bubbly and slightly browned).  My husband had the spaghetti classico, which he REALLY enjoyed.  It had the same sauce base as the sauce that came with the bread.  However, the ambiance of the restaurant is top notch!  We loved the oldschool Italian vibe.  Service was friendly and the entertainment was good (singer/piano player).  The lobby area was beautiful, and the women`s bathroom had a classic glamorous feel to it.  I wish I could`ve written a 5-star review, because I was really hoping for fantastic food."<10<8<2019<16<35<12

Thanks to fellow Honolulu Elite, Nadine C, for taking my husband and I out of our comfort zone (The Strip) to meet with Arizona Elites Joyce and Mike W and first-dine at a Black Bear Diner.    This family-oriented restaurant is famous for its breakfast all-day as it also serves up lunch and dinner.  The ambiance is cute and full of black bear decorations.  Their motto is '"Feed Your Inner Bear'" and the food servings are indeed generous, delicious and food coma producing.  Located in the Tropicana Marketplace, you can`t miss this Black Bear Diner since it`s located right up front of this strip mall and has lots of free parking in their parking lot.  Plus, you`re welcomed by a family of carved wood black bears in front of the restaurant.  Our group of 7 was greeted warmly at the door and was seated immediately.  Luckily, the restaurant wasn`t really crowded as this was a weekday morning but I can imagine how locals or '"people in the know'" would flock here for full meals that will surely stick to your ribs.   Our server, sorry, I didn`t get her name, was gregarious and kept our coffee mugs filled with delicious Nicaraguan coffee and cheerfully took our requests. Before scrolling through the menu, I was looking around the restaurant at other diners` meals to get an idea of how big or small the portions are.  They all looked humongous and sumptuous.    Although I knew my husband had already had his mind set on the Classic 2-Egg Chicken Fried Steak Combo, I warned him about the humongous portions.  Hey, I guess that he was in the mindset of '"Go Big or Go Home'".  He was shocked to see such a huge platter of tender yet crisp crusted beef cutlet (cubed steak) and it was NOT a blasphemous hamburger patty or ground beef that we`ve received in Hawai`i.   Plus he received 2 huge fluffy biscuits covered, no, smothered under sawmill gravy.    He did his best to eat it all but tapped out after only eating 1/2 a biscuit, all of his hash browns and the chicken fried steak.    I chose the Tuna Melt with sweet potato fries from the Little Less Menu. Hmm, so much for Black Bear`s Little Menu....  the sandwich was a huge size, too.  Perfectly grilled marble rye with melted cheese and stuffed with a tuna salad which wasn`t overdosed with mayonnaise and flavorful.  The sweet potato fries were hot from the fryer and had a nice exterior crispness.  We really enjoyed our meals, the friendly service, cleanliness and value of this restaurant.   Now we`re wishing that this chain would be in Hawai`i as I think the locals would enjoy the Black Bear.   For sure, we`d return for another meal the next time we`re in Las Vegas."<14<11<2019<22<10<21
BKUxVWH0ZQlXI0IXdWwzvQ<jnk_iDHyfSn348opeI9iDg<XcBJJ7ZG8iHFrZw0ox0o8Q<1<4<0<1<I absolutely love Nespresso, however the customer service at the Scottsdale location is sub par, at best.   None of the staff walked around or assisted guests as they browsed. Aaron in particular was incredibly uninterested and unenthusiastic when dealing with customers. I watched Aaron speak in a short, condescending manner with a couple, just prior to him motioning me to come to the coffee counter. The look they gave one another as they left his register foreshadowed the experience I was about to have... (It wasn`t pleasant). I ordered my coffee and tried asking questions and was shut down. I was hoping to leave with more than just 2 boxes of pods, but I could not wait to grab my things and leave!  I drove all the way to Scottsdale to the only location that sells the Nespresso coffee pods, only to leave feeling uncomfortable, rushed and defeated. That should NEVER happen in a retail shop. I have been in corporate HR for 12 years, and quality Customer Service is the platform of a successful business. This staff is in dire need of training (Or a complete revamping. From scratch)  It is so nice dealing with people face to face; having personable interaction and getting feedback and advice on what new coffee pods to try! However I will be ordering my coffee pods using the Nespresso App from now on.<7<1<2019<5<47<27

Billed as '"The longest runnuing show in Vegas'" maybe 30-40 people were in attendance, after lining up for a half hour outside the theatre as instructed when I purchased the tickets.  The performance, if you could call it that, was held in a cramped little theatre. VIP tickets in the first few rows meant staring straight up into blinding lights to watch garish (such hideous makeup) showwomen who were simply not sexy.   The music was horrid, there was no humor or talent in the show, just constant calls by the hostest for the audience to cheer and '"get crazy'". Hard to do given the lack of entertainment.   Worst of all, they served no liquor, nor could you bring any in. We left disgusted after the third boring snooze number. Do not waste your money on this show. I have seen many other burlesque/topless shows in Vegas, and never felt cheated, but this time, I want a refund for this debacle."<21<3<2018<14<34<12

There were few patrons but we were seated at the very back of the restaurant next to two gentlemen wearing t-shirts and shorts.  My husband was also wearing a t-shirt and shorts.  We laughed that this must be the section for the under dressed.  Our waiter was polite and very efficient; however, the same could not be said of the maitre d`.  He walked by the guests 3 tables away from us and asked very warmly how they were enjoying their meals but walked swiftly by us and the other gentlemen in t-shirts without a word.  He did this a couple of times.  Needless to say it left a negative impression.  When our meal arrived the salad was nothing more than a bagged salad with a harsh vinegarette dressing.  The scallops were mediocre at best.  We were not impressed with The Capital Grille and won`t recommend to our friends.<22<8<2016<15<35<39

But I think the Vietnamese food from Hot N Spicy was my favorite. I can`t stop thinking about going to their spot in Monona!   The noodles, the soup... OOOOOOH, THE EGGROLLS!!!! Absolutely superb! I wish I hadn`t eaten beforehand -- I would`ve really enjoyed the perfectly balanced spice even more! Thank you to Dan and crew for the tasty (and varied!) buffet!  Thuy Dan did a great job with her first event -- I especially loved the pun cards we could take chances to win prizes with. The other Yelpers and I had fun trying to figure out all of the images, and the prizes were really awesome! (Sheesh, I would`ve loved to have won that bottle! Still, I went home with a growler full of hibiscus juniper cider -- YUM!!)  The owner of Old Sugar was kind enough to let me sample all of the ciders available before I chose the hibiscus juniper -- definitely worth gifting to those who like unique libations. It was dangerously tasty.  Listening to Walker (the cider-maker) talking about his craft was another highlight of the evening -- I absolutely love it when people nerd out on their passions in a way that engages and educates. He waxed poetic for probably 20 minutes, but we barely noticed, it was all so interesting! I can`t wait to try more flavors in the next few months.  Finally, the evening was made complete with a Vietnamese fan dance. I loved watching them dance in formation with the characteristic '"THWAP!'" of all the fans snapping open or closed in unison. Seeing something like this is what makes Yelp events truly special -- where else can you find all of these amazing things in one place?!  Thanks so much to Old Sugar, Hot N Spicy, those amazing dancers and Thuy Dan + Jonathan. What an amazing evening!"<24<11<2019<23<31<20

qZZZsmu52Ze-m1kiKqnKZg<eTQKj5YOx_NQWUokjJuhxQ<kafUXRNfQm3e_U14S2WbmA<5<0<0<0<"Review pizza place  Hey, I admit it when someone suggested we go to a '"pizzeria'" for Sunday brunch, I suggested counter offering with something... anything else. Lol. Trusting my company, I bit my tongue and went along.  It`s been said in this era of automation and too much noise; too much competition for your eyeballs, your ear holes, your mouth hole, and your wallet that the risk takers will stand out. Those who offer something authentic, personal and meaningful. In America we`ve come to think of '"Italian food'" is something that comes from the Olive Garden or dominoes and its easy to forget a rich heritage of food like stuffed lemon leaves, which I never would have ordered, and that would have been a mistake.  It is a pizzeria, and one of us ordered a '"breakfast pizza'", I went for the apricot, bacon and goat cheese pizza with pinenuts, another ordered the arugula salad, the classic pizza, something tasty wrapped in bacon... an order of bread, garlic bread, and another kind of bread that had anchovies in it... and everything was so outstandingly good we just started passing things around and eating family style. The pizza was served with a mascarpone dip, and in Italian version of Sriracha. The attention to detail is what really impressed us. Everything was fresh, delicious, a bit unusual to win American pizzeria (yet very traditional).   We spoke with our server about how many of these dishes are actually hundreds of years old and very typical for Italy, but lesser known here in the states where Italian restaurants are more or less forced to Americanize their offerings. They got everything right from the cured meats, to the cheeses, brands, even the bloody Mary, you could tell was made with real tomatoes, not some mix.   Even the jazz guitarist who performed while we ate was just the right choice. Several of us came to the conclusion that this had been our best restaurant experience in recent memory. You could grab a quick bite at some pizza joint, or you could come here and it feels more like someone`s family had prepared a meal for you out of love to slow down eat, drink, share stories and culture."<9<12<2019<15<57<58

If this happened to Beyonce` in NORTH Scotttsdale somebody would have been fired the day this happened and it would have made news. Too bad I`m just a Native American with no relation to Queen B. 2 federal complaints have been filled against this target because of this incident.  shift leader is (incompetent)/ trained poorly i don`t know how she even has a job as a shift lead. Target Store and Starbucks is ran terribly. I`m pretty sure the acting manager aka shift lead for Starbucks is racist because she wasted my time and didn`t take me seriously. Even though she is the manager of a Starbucks her job is service and she`s terrible at it. Im glad I don`t work for her or this target cause I would be an idiot to work under an incompetent shift leader. She conducted interviewing badly and asked things that are illegal to ask in interviewing..... She didn`t do her JOB. She grilled me and then didn`t give any details about the job only concerned with my availability.  I shop at this Target all the time so they will be seeing me plenty more.i am always pleasant in store and i love getting in and getting out. i`ve never had an attitude with anyone even when i receive poor service. Manager Kevin didn`t even have the decency to apologize for how rude and unprofessional his employees are. Regardless if he is the manager of Starbucks or target. I received the least amount of customer service from this establishment and I really was excited to try and work with target as a student who needs a schedule that fits with my school schedule. I applied for Multiple locations for Target in Scottsdale through target website...I`m available 6 days a week for flexible work and I didn`t even get a consideration or call back for the job and I live in the neighborhood. RACIST cause I don`t see any black people working on the floor I saw a few black people who work in the back. But mostly white employees or light skinned employees. Store manager Kevin and shift leader for Starbucks are unprofessional and don`t care about how they represent Target. BTW this location has no outdoor seating because it`s located inside target...no window seating just a regular SB with no outdoor seating.<25<3<2019<18<18<58

uojeHZWfwcxSr_8XHKEL1g<yjH3ruK_SnNPTK-EAJKmEQ<19wvilYB417bpSWrNl19bw<5<1<0<0<"Jump to '"The Short and Sweet'" if you can`t stomach '"The Long Winded'".  The Long Winded: I grew up in restaurants. I even spent the first five years of my life actually living above one. I have fond memories of playing around the kitchen while the staff pretended I was helping out. Of running through the serving floor, being told to '"shoo shoo'" because there were customers. And of palling around in the parking lot with the neighborhood kids, clutching cans of Coke, and almond cookies I pilfered to share. So it should come as no surprise that for the first twenty plus years of my working life it was in the restaurant service industry. I managed a couple, served at a few, and have been a chef in so many that I have literally lost count. After roughly forty lifetime moves I`ve finally deciding to set down roots in Montreal and the food was the number one reason. So, I think it`s fair to say that I`m familiar with restaurants and have a pretty good idea of what makes a good or bad one.   All that being said, Le Speakeasy has become the standard by which my wife and I hold all other establishments in the area to. '"Speakeasy does this better... I like this a bit more than Speakeasy... blah blah blah'", but more often than not it is the former rather than the latter that is uttered. Maybe it`s because it was the first place we tried in the city after thirty hours of no sleep and a very difficult and long move, or maybe it`s because it`s just so damn close to where we live, but I believe it`s become our go-to spot because they just do it right. If you can`t already tell Le Speakeasy is one of our favorite haunts. And I`ll admit I may have a bit of emotional biased because of the reasons I listed above but before I wrote this review I took the time to read all the previous reviews, paying special attention to the negative ones, and this is what I think.   If Montreal winters are half as bad as they say, I suspect you will find us hibernating at Le Speakeasy to keep our spirits high, our bellies full and our cheeks rosy warm during those long, dark, cold winter nights. I maybe shooting myself in the foot here as it`s our favorite place to sit and seats are few but I recommend that you pony up to the bar. You can chill with Nate, Patrick, or Mary as they meticulously make your drinks over sincere conversation or cheerful barbs. We never feel like we`re inconveniencing them when asking for something special. They always seem to delight in creating concoctions of our or their own design while still producing classic clean-cut cocktails. From there you can see Alex as he deftly prepares your meal. You will find that he is fast and efficient while not being hurried. Taking the time to getting each dish as close to perfect as possible, the results have never failed to be crave worthy. It`s not uncommon for my wife and I to share three mains between us despite our limited stomach capacity. Is there the odd misstep in this predominately well oiled machine? Ya of course. It`s the nature of the business but that brings me to David, the linchpin. You`ll find this towering, handsome gentleman greeting you at the door with a warm smile, going from table to table making sure everyone is happy, dealing with any slips or mishaps, helping his fellow co-workers, processing the restaurant`s needs, and yet, it seems like he is always there the very moment you realize you need something. The entire staff come together to provide mindful and efficient service with genuine enthusiasm. They take pride in their work and are eager to make your experience an enjoyable one. If you are looking for a place to enjoy we couldn`t recommend Le Speakeasy more. There are good people there. Perhaps even better food. ;P  The Short and Sweet: - It`s quaint, refined, and rough around the edges, all at the same time. - The drinks are proper. - The food is delicious. - Excellent quality, seamlessly blending gastrolounge with fine dining cuisine and ingredients.  - Main dishes are filling if not too filling. - Pricing is on par with surrounding establishments. - The staff take pride and enjoyment from their work and it can be felt. - Fun but professional. Intimate but social."<5<8<2019<19<14<39

I discovered Dr. Mulholland and did some reading and talking to friends who had friends who knew him or worked with him. All that I heard was reassuring and encouraging. I had a consultation with Paulette (his nurse at the time), then Dr. M. I was extremely impressed..and I am a hard marker. There was no pressuere that I felt, and I received honest assessments of what could be accomplished for me. My expectations were realistic, which is helpful...very helpful. I did not need to look 20 years younger...just maybe 10..or so! My face, neck, and breasts were my focus. Dr. Mulholland showed me what he felt he could do and I decided to put myself in his very capable hands. I had read about his previous experience in head/neck surgery and asked questions about his clinic set up and pre/post operative care and follow-up. I was extremely impressed by his requirements for pre-operative work-up (blood work, EKG, eye doctor visit, etc). As a RN with OR training/experience, I knew what I needed to see and I saw it! Additionally, everyone was polite, kind, and willing to answer all my questions. I felt very relaxed entrusting my care to Dr. Mulholland and his team. Dr. Mulholland is confident in his own skills and it is not misplaced. The man is talented....both as a surgeon and artist, and his results are outstanding. Having my procedures done (face and neck surgery and breast augmentation) was one of the best decisions I have ever made. I was guided every step of the way...before and after surgery...(advised what to expect physically and even emotionally every week post-operatively). There was very litte pain...not any pain, really, thanks to excellent surgical technique, medications, and the ice mask/machine!! (Loved that thing!). Dr. Mulholland did my face and Dr. Krajden did my breasts and the results were even better than I expected. I was not '"over-done'"...and within a few weeks, there was no sign at all that I had surgery. I recieved so many compliments and nobody believed I was the age I was! I maintained the results over the years with FotoFacials and occasional Botox...and I am always treated like a valued client. It is always wonderful to go back to see Dr. Mulholland and the folks at the clinic once a year or so. And, recently, I had the privilege of being a demo patient for several minor procedures, where the work is complementary and the results amazing. I HIGHLY recommend that, if anyone is considering having any cosmetic procedures done, you at least go speak with Dr. Mulhollad and/or one of his nurses....you will receive an honest evalutaion of your own particular goals, and experience the very highest standard of care."<10<12<2019<23<3<19

We started off with the cauliflower affogato. The first few bites were lackluster, but halfway through, it started to grow on me. The flavors were subtle but became more pronounced later on. It was a  decent starter to wet your palate. Oh, and we asked for a side of ranch, and OMG, their ranch was like crack!! Can I order a gallon of that to-go? We shared the Crepe lasagna (crespelle al forno). Personally, I prefer the thickness and density of regular pasta, but this was an interesting take on lasagna. The texture was very airy and light, and the meat sauce was great!  Trying their pizza was a no-brainer so we decided to go with half classic pepperoni and half Calabrese. The pizza dough was incredible! It had an airy yet chewy consistency to it, almost like sourdough. We were informed by the server that they use two special kinds of yeast strains to ferment their dough. It was unlike any other pizza dough I`ve tasted! We concluded the night with the Sicilian style donut, which was basically like a cream puff. The donut itself had a nutty, almond-like flavor, which I really enjoyed.   Our server was friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu, but he seemed to disappear moments throughout the night when we needed him. Overall though, we were thoroughly impressed with our dinner, and we will definitely be back to try some more dishes and pizzas.   I also didn`t know this, but Monzu is affiliated with Nora`s.

But then when she lost her job, we went to them asking for help, or even recourses to try to find help, but they shut their doors on us. When we became homeless and had to sleep in my moms car we went to this church asking for help, and even tried parking there at night thinking it would be a safe spot to sleep, but when they saw that, they called the POLICE on us! And told us we weren`t allowed to be on the property, after YEARS of my mother giving to pastors Paul and Denise Goulet, that broke my moms heart that they were so quick to get rid of us instead of offer any type of help. She spent the entire night crying and scared not knowing where to go, or even who to turn to for help. We even got a letter in the mail from the church about a week before we got evicted out of our home from the church thanking my mom for giving over $3,000 to the church our last year going there...  Long story short, as long as you have money to give, they`ll '"value your loyalty to their church'", but once that money runs out, and it`s you who needs financial help or resources... good luck.  This '"church'" is more like a high school and if you`re not one of the '"populars'" then you might as well be non-existent. This church has turned my sister an I away from ever wanting to have anything to do with any Christians ever again."<3<10<2019<5<3<57

We went around lunch time so we decided to order some dim sum and a few dishes from their menu.  Dim sum was very average. Clams in black bean sauce was decent, one of the better dishes for here. The egg tarts were very buttery and not sweet enough. We ordered a live crab but they didn`t show it to us before they cooked it, unlike some other similar places in town.

While the asphalt resealing business may not be a beacon of integrity in the business world, this establishment is guilty of false advertising, shoddy  workmanship and a dig- in- their heels mentality if a problem arises.  No. 1: False  advertising. Their contract states that they will apply 2  '"heavy coats'" of sealcoating to the drive.  In actuality, they spray the mix from a showerhead pipe type set up on a truck as they drive down your driveway once and then leave, done in under 2 minutes . If two actual coats were applied, as stipulated in the contract ,there would need to be drying time in between as I researched: According to Asphalt Pavement  Solutions and Affordable Stripping and Sealing, LLC, the following  principles are followed in resealing :  Customers sometimes wonder why it is necessary to apply multiple coats rather than a single thick coat. It is the same principle that requires house painters to use multiple coats of paint to provide full coverage for problem areas or achieve a richer color. Thick layers cannot dry properly. Whether it is paint or asphalt sealer, moisture trapped beneath the top coat can undermine the effectiveness of the product. Each coat must be allowed to dry before another coat is applied,   When I asked the company how two coats could have possibly been  applied, they responded that there was '"overlay'". I can attest that no  areas were repeated or overlapped, and from the above research, that is  not how multiple coats are actually done.   2. Shoddy workmanship: In addition to the drive by sealcoat method, my work order included cleaning. As far as I can tell, the cleaning period consisted of placing wood stakes on either side of the apron with yellow ribbon to prevent driving on the surface before leaving.  3.When I complained and sent pictures , it was clear that they had an  answer for everything, including the under 2 minutes time to complete the job-eg; the workman were so experienced they could complete a job that fast.  To save the reader time, I will copy the heading from BBB on this business that I should have read : The BBB has received a pattern of complaints against this firm concerning dissatisfaction with the quality of work performed; some complaints concern a failure to return deposits; other complaints concern a failure to return phone calls.  On February 4, 2014, the BBB contacted the company concerning this apparent complaint pattern and its failure to correct the underlying cause of these complaints.  The company did not respond to the BBB.  On Angie`s list, the reviews run from a grade '"C'" to '"F'" with the majority of the reviews listing a grade '"D'".  I hope this helps someone do their homework ( look on Angie`s list) and find a reputable sealcoater in their neighborhood. I would strongly discourage anyone from this establishment."<15<6<2019<3<0<7

The restaurant was actually quite empty as we came by during an off-peak time, but we decided to give it a try anyways.   I enjoyed being able to pick the type of noodles and the staff working that night were not at all frosty. We had some questions since it was our first time there and they were friendly to us. We both ordered a variation of the beef noodles and were pleasantly surprised! The beef broth was lovely- light but flavorful. The noodles themselves were alright, too much doughy taste (not sure if this was because we ordered thick cut flat noodles.. but this still should not be doughy tasting). The amount of beef was stingy and the meat itself was overcooked.  I should note that the entire time (from when we were seated to when we left) there were fruit flies everywhere.

The food was delicious! Each dish came out at the right time and we had enough time in between to cleanse our palettes and make room for more food. I really enjoyed the ravioli that he made with a brown butter base! The seafood in a tomato base was also delicious. For the main course, we had fish, and it`s not everyday where someone will not only debone and cut the fish in front of you WHILE serenading you with an Italian ballad.

Those members would rather sit, yawn and stare right through, until we eventually lose patience and until we literally get there in their face, no action is taken.  They claim you can sit in the cafeteria and enjoy kids playing. The cafeteria is divided from the entrance through a thin half size cubicle wall, yet they intentionally enclosed it in such a way that you are only able to get there through a playground and for that you have to have socks, which they will happily sell you for $2.5, but never let you know at not only kids have to have them.

So every waiter and waitress has to work on the 26 checks? You can`t send one over to take our order? In the meantime, the place was less than half full and the bartender is bussing tables and not tending the bar. So, when we went to the bar from our table to get OUR OWN DRINKS, the bartender was busy cleaning tables. This happened THREE TIMES!

The total was like 18 dollars and change. I told him I had the change because I didn`t want a bunch of coins back but ofcourse he didn`t hear me cuz he was gossiping with the other associates. He then gave me my change and told him I had exact change. He said '"oh honey, I already put it in the computer'". I was trying to explain to him that it`s still the same amount whether I give him exact change or not. He literally did not know how to do the math. I finally said '"do u not know how to do math?'"

I picked out a couple that sounded really cool and catering to the concerns that I have. The prices were good but there were some items that were over priced that you can buy in a multipack for the same price.   Other K-Beauty skincare items were really cool.

We were both taken off guard and didn`t even know how to respond so we just took the food and left. The food itself was fine, the chicken was a bit soggy, but the sauce was good, the pork was actually ham and wasn`t very flavorful, but the veggies with it were fresh and tasty. It was nothing special but better than Panda Express or some other fast food place.  In short the food isn`t bad, but we`re definitely going to keep looking for something with better food, where the owner can let us buy food without telling us he doesn`t approve of us as a couple."<3<9<2018<14<17<1

Late in the day! I was very angry and upset and I called another vet in town and although he was completely booked (Dr. Todd at Pet Pro) welcomed me to bring my dog in asap. Our dog was put to sleep and was put out of her suffering by a vet that didn`t even know her. He showed such concern and compassion. More than I ever got in the 15 years at SprortsVet. SportsVet is awful. Only after the money. They may have fancy equipment and a fancy new building but they don`t have heart in my opinion.

I had a lot of varied ideas and varied styles that I was in love with and it definitely had to have some sparkle and bling!

My first experience with Brilliant Bridal was open-minded. I really didn`t know what to expect and was hoping for something that was not outdated and financially obtainable. I had the pleasure of working with Helen, and she was so cheerful, helpful and willing to do what it took to see my needs were met. There was a good variety of beautiful, and elegant dresses in my size and I knew I was in the right place.  I was so incredibly happy with the outcome of this experience. I was able to find '"The One` dress made for me!

My first taste of it in New York 2 years ago, sent a friend and I running around the big apple in the wee hours of the night taking multiple trains and walking blocks after blocks through torrential rain, just to get it almost every day we were there.    Fast forward to a year later, and they opened one a bit closer to me, in my second home, Vegas.  Once again, braving horrible conditions of 110 degree plus weather, and a $7 parking fee, I trucked my ass all the way to the Cosmo from Mandalay Bay and $30 later I had my cereal milk soft serve.  They also have a crack pie soft serve, which my friend preferred over the cereal milk.  Me, I prefer the original. You can get the soft serve in shake form, which is pretty handy, especially if you are trying to rush back to your car to avoid the parking fee after 1 hour.    It`s expensive, it`s a small serving, and it`s worth every penny. That is, if it`s your thing.  The crack pie, which I also love, tastes a bit stale at the Vegas location.  The pie I can do without, especially since it costs something like $10 a slice (ok, more like $6).    The cookies are not my favorite.  While they are good, they aren`t worth the price.  The cakes, on the other hand, are definitely worth a try. We ordered a whole birthday cake for my hubby and it was exactly has we hoped it would be. If you like the birthday cake flavor, this is the cake for you.    The service from the cashiers is hit or miss.  I`ve had the same, disinterested one several times, and for this price and from a place this popular, I would expect friendlier service.  It`s borderline rude.  I`ve also had nicer service from other employees, so I can`t say it`s a consistent problem.    All in all, a perfect little place for the Cosmopolitan and it`s uber hip and trendy crowd. Especially with Block 16 opening up soon. It fits right in.<21<9<2018<6<16<46

At this point it`s become an annual tradition for me and a birthmonth indulgence for myself.  Although I`ve been here several times, their menu is so extensive that there are still a whole lot of items that I still haven`t tried.  I finally tried their Crispy Asparagus Okaki and Cold Green Tea Soba Noodle with Poached Egg. Everything was really good!! Especially the grilled Salmon Belly!  Here are the food pics:  Enoki Mushroom with Bacon -- http://bit.ly/2lgT6XR  Crispy Asparagus Okaki -- http://bit.ly/2lgAfMG  Cold Green Tea Soba Noodle with Poached Egg -- http://bit.ly/2lg7RtU  Salmon Belly (special) -- http://bit.ly/2ldUkmG  Agedashi Tofu -- http://bit.ly/2lgHIuZ  Foie Gras with Glazed Soy Based Sauce -- http://bit.ly/2lhnnpx  As expected, I really enjoyed everything.  I think I ordered a little too much though, as the Green Tea Soba Noodles filled me up even though I had like 3 more items to come.  The Crispy Asparagus Okaki was amazing!  They were lightly fried and delicately crispy.  And the Salmon Belly special was grilled to perfection and had a creamy texture.  Everything else I`ve had before and they were still as awesome as ever, especially the Grilled Foie Gras and Agedashi Tofu!  There`s really nothing more to say other than just another awesome dining experience at Aburiya Raku.  The food and service are still consistently top notch, and it is still my favorite Japanese restaurant of all time outside of Japan.<19<2<2018<9<56<12

The owner is very nice. But two horrible experiences with their staff completely turned us off. Now we prefer to drive farther and pay more just to get better service.  One time we ordered soup and we told them not to add any shellfish due to the food allergy. The waitress serving our table assured us there wouldn`t be any shellfish but when she brought us the food, I saw crab meat in our soup. I told the waitress and she said they will make a new one. She didn`t apologize but appeared quite annoyed and then she quickly brought us the new soup within a minute or so. It was so quick that I suspected they just took the visible crab meat out instead of making a new dish. So I asked her just to make sure they made a new dish as she said. She was very irritated and rude when answering my question, which made it more suspicious. When she put the soup loudly on our table, a little bit soup was spilled out. She saw it but she didn`t say anything or clean it up. I didn`t want to make a scene, so I let it go. I paid the soup at the full price with tips but I didn`t want to touch it because I didn`t think she was honest. And she didn`t bother to ask us why.   Then this Saturday night we ordered some food over the phone. The girl who answered the phone had a terrible manner. She was very rude, impatient and unprofessional. She even didn`t know how to place our order. I asked her to talk to the owner who is always around the restaurant and he knows what it means. She told me the owner was not there and she had nobody else to ask for help either. We ordered the same food for a few years and nobody had a problem to place our order except her. We used the excactly same name and the same term that the owner and their other employees had told us. It was not our fault she was not familiar with her work or their menu. But instead of solving the problem, she preferred arguing impatiently in a very unfriendly and loudly tone. She was so irritated, impatient or lazy that she didn`t want to ask other staff in the restaurant to help her understand what a customer wants. Moreover, she became very mad at me when I simply reminded her of her manner towards a customer. She tried to blame me and she raised her voice so high like almost yelling over the phone, which really hurted my ear. I didn`t want to quarrel with her so I ended the call without ordering anything. How aweful and ridiculous was that! I just wish the owner were there listening how she just pushed his long-time customers away forever by her unbelievablly unprofessional, horrible and rude attitude.   That was it. I will never order any food from them anymore because you just don`t know when you will encounter some terrible staff who will ruin your weekend. I ain`t gonna pay any penny for such horrible customer service and being treated so disrespectfully. The owner is nice but he needs to train his employees to treat his customers nicely too.<20<10<2019<18<20<48
hWc3V4DgFP5GbxMonapBDw<7rvsntPtg7USvFzsKWL6PA<4CjzDtHbitJsIhuhgsu4Yw<2<8<0<0<"About Lumiere Chandler  The community itself is amazing! Grounds are nicely kept, pretty quiet and safe. I would recommend new comers! However I would advise to proceed with caution especially those from out of state. They should be  aware about their policies because they may be a lot different than you may be accustomed to in your prior state. The property really does not allow any room for being late and does not really care about your story. They want their payment on the 1st no later and rightfully so, but there is no room for any payment arrangements of any type I mean things do come up. If you dont have the cash when they want it fees accumulate and they send the attorneys on you after day 7 of being late unless you pay the ridiculous fees prior to your court date or before being served with eviction papers. I pay between 100-300 more than quoted rent because of AZ tax, water, trash, and late fees EVERYMONTH. They tried telling me to turn in my keys day before my courtdate for eviction and I would not have an eviction on my record, but would need to be out, and pay them 1400 a month to keep '"not honoring my lease'" off my credit. I dont want neither that our an eviction. Then was told in my notes in their system since my husband or I couldnt pay the rent to turn in my keys. We just need an additional week to pay but they were not hearing it. Who ever said we would couldn`t pay the rent? So I would move, pay my normal rent wherever else I decided to go, then pay Lumiere rent even though im not living there. Crooks! Needless to say because there were not any grace days as I`m accustomed too, no night slots, ability to pay by check etc. No willingness to extend the time of payment(only for the elderly do they allow this.) I will not resign my lease, lots of headache. But as said before beautiful place.

Well first off it`s a complete disaster in here, but that`s typical of Ross.  My annoyance is at the cashier. Didn`t get his name, 30 something year old short male working at 7:30 on Feb 26. Not that anyone will look him up.   Anyways, rings me up. I grab my single bag off the counter because he couldn`t hand it to me. The receipt prints on his receipt printer on HIS side of the counter facing HIM. And he literally just looks at me and says '"there`s your receipt'". I sorry but I`m pretty sure you are able bodied enough to hand me at least my receipt, when hand me my single bag was too much for you.     It really doesn`t take much effort to pick a piece of paper off your printer and hand it to a customer. You made me reach over and rip it off.    I can guarantee this guy is one of the people that thinks $15 should be the minimum wage.   Well guy, you suck."<27<2<2016<2<35<15

During the consultation I clearly explained to the woman that I did not want to purchase any more products and spend more money and just wanted to try out the cosmetic procedures I had purchased which was already $300.  Once I was finally seen by the '"doctor'" she was like, what else do you want done, what else? I assumed she meant by using the package I had  purchased through groupon. Nope. Was slapped with an additional $500 for the extra filler I had '"asked'" for after the procedure was done. Which during the consult I clearly said I didn`t want to buy anymore of.   Left bitter and more broke than expected. But loved the plumpness in my face and no lines around my mouth.   Few days later, I noticed the fine lines around my eyes were uneven and the nasal fold lines had returned, even though I was told filler lasts about a year.   So I had $800 worth of product in my face and nothing to show for it except one eye looked better than the other.   Not sure what kind of no name product they use.

Kang Thai may be serving up food from a counter nestled into the Internet Cafe space by CSN but the quality, service, and presentation easily exceed what I`ve received in long-established brick and mortar locations.   Came in with the BF, armed with a groupon. Ordered the crispy pork app ($9), shrimp pad se ew ($10), and green curry with chicken ($11). Other than receiving my noodle dish with chicken instead of seafood, all was great: heaping portions covered the plates, garnishes were provided, metal utensils and cups of water were provided, all brought out to our table on a tray. My noodles had plenty of veggies and protein, while the thick curry had a good heat level. The plentiful crispy pork app lived up to it`s name in terms of terms of texture, and paired better with the curry sauce rather than the provided plum sauce. The app was demolished but our lunch portions were large enough to warrant a takeout box to comprise a dinner portion for later. I was extremely pleased with my find, discount or not.   I work and live nearby and anticipate that this is the first of several visits here, both for dine in and takeout. They offer order ahead with GrubHub (via Yelp app), as well as delivery. Bonus points for offering several vegan items. I`ll be coming back for the Kaw Man Kai (similar to Hainanese chicken) and Kaw Ka Moo (pork version) soon- fingers crossed they add Khao Soi to the menu too!<12<11<2018<20<52<45

Norterra Cleaner`s has provided alterations to all my suits and dress pants. A few months ago I brought my three pairs of dress pants in to be hemmed and tapered. I asked to have all three of my dress pants altered exactly the same.   However, my best suit pants were not altered to match the other dress pants. I didn`t realize the mistake until 2 months after the alteration because I don`t wear my best suit very often. I brought the pants back, they still had the yellow tag that the dry cleaners place on the pants after they are altered. The employee told me I waited too long to bring the pants back and would be charged 10 dollars for something that wasn`t my mistake. I didn`t even wear the pants. Who cares if it had been two months?   When I came to pick up my pants, the same employee changed her attitude and told me I would be charged 18 dollars. Ridiculous. The very same day when I got home, I noticed a tear on the side of my 300 suit pants that wasn`t there before the alteration. Now, I have to go back and waste more time. So frustrating.  8/13  I took the pants back to the dry cleaners and they offered to fix for free.. supposedly. I asked one store employee for the manager to call me and messaged the business on Yelp. No call from management as of today. The employee inside the store told me '"the manager might call me'" If you read reviews from other people that seems to be a trend.  8/20   Last week I received a message from the store owner on Yelp telling me that the hole will be repaired at no cost. The store also explained that I would receive a phone call once the repair is complete. I have not received any follow up. I messaged the business on Yelp today."<11<8<2019<7<12<4

The food is nearly always excellent, but the service is uneven.  We went in for Sunday brunch and found the restaurant maybe half-full.  We stood at the podium and waited for the hostess to seat us.... and waited..... and waited....   it was a good ten minutes before the hostess appeared (with no apology) and seated us in back when there were plenty of tables by a window--not a big deal though.    And we waited.... and waited....  after fifteen minutes of being ignored by several servers going to other tables, my wife got up and reminded the hostess of our existence and that we had not seen a server at our table.  Another five to seven minutes of waiting and we got up and left.  On our way out, we mentioned that we were leaving to a server who acted like we had told an extremely funny joke.  Never again, La Brioche.  You have lost our business forever!   BTW, we went to Cafe Hollander in Hilldale where we were seated and waited upon immediately.  The food was outstanding too.  I strongly recommend Cafe Hollander over La Brioche!!!<13<6<2017<2<14<53

NpujVCjl4SHELN0V8EkIUg<AA4EmkZwGfgpezbJH90WDw<3fdtp-bzoE4ZgTakkcEBzQ<5<25<19<25<"Las Vegas is different. Welcome to a city where your senses of sight, sound and taste are likely to trump over any other cities you`ve visited (except perhaps Time Square NYC).  In LV, an adrenaline rush might even kick you where a royal flush beats all. The world-renowned Strip, a mere 4-mile stretch of Las Vegas Blvd, can send your heart pulsating 24/7! The whole Strip is like one make-believe glitzy neon and LED signage complete with life-like replicas of major cities of the world, a spectacular fountain show, a Venetian gondola ride, a Disneyland style lava-spewing volcano, a giant Ferris Wheel and of course world class casinos, fine international cuisines and mega hotel resorts. The sounds are uniquely cacophonous, when dice are rolled at a crap table; '"gone-over-21'" moans at a black jack table; the joyous screams of '"it`s about time!'" when a roulette ball drops on your winning number; and the high fives from winners of slot machines, where the new winning combos are now too complicated for me understand other than the archaic 7-7-7!   Hey, isn`t LV considered the entertainment center of the world? There are so many shows in the city catering to diverse interests, some of them even children friendly.  Anyone can enjoy an enthralling evening with the acrobats, comedians, big name divas, magicians, LV showgirls, Broadway productions etc. Check with your hotel`s concierge or go online for discounted tickets.  Being a reformed gambler and now a raging foodie, I came here for the food! Does that make sense? I was last here 25 years ago and I was told LV has since grown beyond recognition. Outside of the Strip, LV has developed into one sprawling Chinatown or at least an Asian town! By golly! I`ve got to see this to believe! I have hoped to experience the Chinese food renaissance in LV and what better time than during the auspicious lunar New Year celebrations!  I seldom see so much diversity in a city`s Chinese offerings or such a wide range of classiness between Chinese restaurants! The fast-casual hole-in-the-wall eatery like K J Kitchen (Spring Mountain Road, LV) was recommended and appealed to the Chinese second nature for good authentic and inexpensive food far more than Blue Skies Café that I liked in the Bay Area. At the other end of the spectrum, there are far more super upscale fine Chinese dining in the LV Strip at Wing Lei (Wynn`s), Blossom (Aria`s) and Jasmine (Bellagio`s) all these can cause a whopping dent to my pocket book.  LV and its close vicinities are not lacking for the outdoorsy types to explore. The closest was Red Rock Canyon, which I reviewed earlier. Hoover Dam, which was kinda boring for me, but can be exhilarating for others. If the Red Rock Canyon is not awe inspiring enough, take a helicopter ride to nearby Grand Canyon that would surely blow your mind off especially for first timers. And for the more adventurous with time on their side, they can even consider a short trip to beautiful Lake Tahoe, for summer hiking, biking and fishing or winter sports in the surrounding mountains."<28<2<2019<5<38<8

There were 13 of us (in a game that holds 16 people) so we bought out the game so we could be a complete team. With that said, once the game start we organically broke out into different teams to take on the rooms/challenges.  It was difficult, but not impossible and unlike another escape room I`ve done in the past, there were `characters` that added excitement, a story and helpful tips so we didn`t waste all our time chasing the wrong clues.  By the end of the game we were all united, excited and ALMOST GOT OUT!  We have been raving about this experience to our co-workers and have suggested it for their own team building excursions.  I`d love to try the OTHER games Casa Loma offers and definitely forsee myself doing so!<12<12<2017<20<5<43

Unfortunately I was disappointed. Our waitress seemed disconnected, was not friendly and seemed like she didn`t want to be there, so that was not a good start. We started with the lump crab appetizer which was good. They don`t give you enough tortillas to dip, so I asked for a couple more and saw a charge on my bill for that. The place is loud, so be prepared. I had the shrimp and lobster fettuccine which was ok, a little bland, and the Lake House salad, which was good, original. Unfortunately I didn`t see anything interesting on the cocktail menu so I had water. My bill for the 3 items came to $48, which I thought was a bit high for what I got. There are other places I would rather go if I`m going to spend $50 for a meal. I look forward to going back to Lindys in Columbus again but the Lake House, probably not.<16<11<2019<14<37<10

Visited for a birthday bash and somewhat thought that the '"quarter'" in `French Quarter` was referring to how incredibly small this area is. Charlotte`s version is bite size compared to other cities but it does pack a stylish punch. We were set up in the back room so we could all sit together, about 20 of us. The two bartenders/servers were on point keeping drinks full and getting food orders, once we all arrived. The kitchen seemed over-whelmed, because the food was VERY scattered. Some of us received plates, finished our food and our plates were taken before others received theirs. I don`t typically like to eat until everyone has been served, but that was a long differential.  Otherwise, Valhalla was incredibly accommodating and had some delicious beverage specials. It`s also stationed below the Cotton Room, which is also INCREDIBLY SMALL, quaint maybe; but is convenient for the after party."<8<7<2019<9<24<41

But we will seat you soon.'" Only seconds later we were seated.  At the table we were given dirty menus and a sticky table. Our drink order was taken immediately and brought to us just as quickly. I requested silverware and creamer only to wait until my coffee was cold and my orange juice was finished.  Everything coming out of the Kitchen looks and smells amazing!

I was having severe reactions to dental work and brought the items from the dentist for patches. So I come back a few weeks later cause one gal only does the patches and she`s booked! But I also agree to allergy shots again and am assured I won`t have a reaction like I did years ago. Ok. Great. The nurse happen to notice Dr. Errington forgot to put cat in my serum! The most important! So he mixes me up some more for free. They forget to call me and it expires so now it`s almost mid April and still no allergy shots. Supposedly they will be ready Wednesday but no one ever calls me back except for once! After this batch of allergy shots is done if I ever get them I think I`ll be looking for a new allergist.

Sat right away, great low lighting, nice calm ambiance, chill vibe. Able to have a conversation even! Not loud!!  We were helped after a bit and decided to share some plates rather than order our own. So glad with that idea! We ordered the Lobster Garlic Noodles and the Tuna Pokè bowl, along with each a hot tea. Ok ok, good grief, you know how '"Lobster Garlic Noodles'" sounds like something really really delicious that you would eat every day? That was this! It was a culinary delight. PERFECT mix and blend of flavorings: not too garlicky, not too buttery, not too Lobster-y, it was absolutely perfect!!!!! The Lobster was grilled to perfection, and not spongy or soggy or anything. Cooked perfectly. Noodles, perfect. Sauce ratio, perfect. LOVED IT! The tuna pokè bowl came out a short while after, and we both love some pokè bowls, but this poke bowl was different, in that, the rice, the main ingredient, was I don`t know, like, different rice in some way. It wasn`t like regular bland white plain-ass rice, it was special rice that had flavor and didn`t stick together some how. The raw tuna was fantastic, the other flavors were so, not earthy, but '"sea-y'". It was probably the best pokè bowl I`ve had. Ten out of ten. Then we decided to share a dessert. Molten lava cake with a side of ice cream. Good grief, there was melted fudge on the inside of the cake!! There were cut strawberries to eat, there was ice cream. Oh boy it was amazing.  The meal itself could not have been any better. Such a random lucky place to pop in to.  Service could`ve been better, but wasn`t '"bad.'"

Growing up I would drive by and wonder what kind of person actually hung out in an establishment like the Cricket.  Last Saturday, I was that person.  Well, it was for a bachelor party, but pretty safe to say I will be returning at some point or another.   Why? Mostly due to no Cover (We got there around 9/930), and well priced beer and shots.

What avgs to about $10 a roll they left much to be desired. I know the alkalinity has a lot to do with dough flavor and text so that`s not there fault BUT the crust came partially burnt and completely flavorless, but that`s not where it ended. The first bite left me with a very salty and greasy mouthful of flavorless pepperoni and cheese. Maybe there pizza is good I don`t know, my first experience at Carmines.

The only reason I left was because I moved out of the area. Other offices that I have seen asked where I was going before and I would tell them Sun City and they would ALL say '"That`s a really good Animal Hospital.'" When I attempted to shop around for a feline tooth extraction, they all wanted MORE than Sun City.  I had a dog, a family dog, that suddenly got extremely sick. After  tests, it was determined that he was suffering from congestive heart failure. The tests were done and everything was explained to be VERY thorough. My pooch was very sick=(  Shortly after, we had to put him down but Sun City and their staff was extremely supportive through the process which was devastating to me. I couldn`t have asked for more when I felt as if I lost a member of my family (because I did). I have friends who are Vet Techs in other states, and they said that all tests that were done were required to eliminate other things. There is no magic wand to wave over your precious puppy or kitty that tells a Vet what`s wrong. A Vet can`t ask your pet '"Where does it hurt?'" so tests are required and not cheap. If you have an issue with costs when an animal gets sick, perhaps you should rethink being a pet owner in the first place.  I may move out of the immediate area, however, I will always drive to Sun City for the care of my animals and wouldn`t trust anyone else."<28<2<2015<4<52<9

First off, how the hell do you have riding car toys all over the place and tell CUSTOMERS not to play on them?  Be smart put them up high or somewhere else figure it out - this chick snapped at my 2 year old son to get off the toy today in such a rude tone it was unbelievable - when I suggested maybe put the toys up high she talked OVER ME repeating herself several times TELL ME WHERE!?!?! TELL ME WHERE!?!?! complaining that she was now going to have to sanitize and clean the toy because it`s for sale - ummmmmm isnt that why you make the big bucks here? She was so snarky and just plain RUDE.  Don`t complain to a customer about how much work you have - if you dint like your job then quit.  There`s no bathroom here either- and absolutely no I`m sorry`s for the inconvenience either it was explained to me in a very dead pan tone without even looking at me today with a valley girl  inflection from Tessa '" we don`t have a bathroom'" when I said oh! Really ???? Wondering what to do with a two year old we are potty training - she said I could go to Lowe`s - I said he won`t make it that far we`ll have to go outside by the car ! I laughed . Again just staring deadpan - some eye rolls and side glances from the dubious clerks - someone teach these horrific extensions to your customers how to say I`m Sorry please ! Fake it.  I`d fire you both immediately - this isn`t the first time I`ve been treated poorly here, the blonde one just has a perpetual stick up her ass and I`m always glad that she is not there when I shop - she`s one of those people who just makes you feel bad for asking questions - oh and she doesn`t look at you when she speaks to you - AT ALL- she looks down at the register and listens in as u talk to others and she chimes in  as she`s doing something else - possible anti social problem maybe ? And of course $117 that I spent less than a week ago were nowhere to be found in my rewards and then the blonde of course says maybe I spent it? When she finally grabbed my receipt and realized that the clerk from less than a week ago did not add in my rewards again, no I`m sorry for that, nothing at all they just very dryly and curtly told me how to gain my points back.

So it took a moment to figure out what stood out.     Tapas style restaurants are the new faces of what the Vegas dining experience have evolved towards over the past few years... like Zuma and Fire Fly. The appetizer size portions allow you to share, taste a little of everything, and not get overly stuffed where the normal food coma would kick in after 30-45 mins.     EDO represents this new generation of food joints very well in its unique offerings of taste, experience, smells, and creativity.   Some would even argue that EDO will challenge all of your 6 sensors to provide for a memorable dining experience.    Since it was our first time here, we opted for the tapas sampler which allowed us to taste approximately 6-7 different dishes ranging from a bruschetta-ish dish to a dried curry noodle dish that befuddled our taste buds and sight since it looked more like art than food.  Thank goodness everything was edible, we had good company, and our bellies left satisfied.   Enjoy the pics to see if EDO is your thing and if whether the juice is worth the squeeze.  Bon appetite!<13<10<2019<16<43<51
YVhzomgfw_OXFlgG7yQMaQ<KkinPjnHr3LpAeiBL9ap0Q<1XFFW1qzcNyqNNaEE23SfQ<1<1<1<1<"I sent my husband here to be evaluated for several months of neck pain. I`ll try to summarize his terrible experience here to save others the hassle of coming here.   First Appt: NP ordered an MRI. Told husband she couldn`t do anything else until she saw MRI. Okay, fair enough.   Husband got MRI, made second appt. Saw a physician this time.  Second appt: Doctor says he recommends an epidural in my husband`s neck. Before my husband could say how he felt about a needle going through his neck, the doctor left the room. My husband came home telling me he didn`t want a needle going through his neck, especially after just recently witnessing my epidural during labor. Okay, so I tell him to make a third appt and to express these concerns, before the doctor leaves.   Third Appt: sees a different new grad NP. In a nutshell, tells him he`s young enough to Deal with the pain. Tells my husband to go to PT, do acupuncture (my husband already told her he doesn`t do needles), and Tylenol. My husband went through months of PT and also went to monthly massages without relief. NP says to keep trying till it works. Um what? You tell a patient he`s young enough, so he should just deal with the pain? Also, to make matters worse, she documents an entire physical exam WITHOUT touching him one time!! Avoid Hanna Bangura the NP at all costs. As a physician assistant myself, I was SHOCKED that she didn`t apply one finger to my husband... and had the gall to tell him he`s young enough to deal with pain. Before she ran out the door, my husband asked for diclofenac gel (a glorified ibuprofen cream) to see if that helps. She didn`t offer him any kind of options!! He had to come up with a possible solution. My question is, when do you become '"old enough'" to get help for pain? Before or after you are on the '"BEERS'" criteria (guidelines for healthcare professionals to help improve the safety of prescribing medications for older adults)??   When I contacted the office manager, I even asked her to look my husband up on AZPMP, because my husband hadn`t had any kind of opiate since 2009 for broken ribs with pneumothorax. The manager agreed that the NP (Hannah Bangura) was new at the practice, and asked me what I would have done differently (I guess she asked me because I was a PA?) I gave her several options Hannah could have done!! You don`t just send a patient who has done everything you asked without relief home and tell them they`re young enough to deal with pain. You just don`t. That`s not practicing good medicine.   Here is the cherry on top. The office manager told me she would reschedule my husband with the owner of the practice (doctor/surgeon) on October 2nd. I optimistically rescheduled hoping for a better outcome. She said he had better bedside manner. I told her my husband needed to be seen in the mornings only because he has work. So she scheduled him first thing in the morning but hesitantly said the doctor may be late. She said, '"you know how doctors are. They`re late.'" I was like what?? That doesn`t happen where I`ve worked. I can`t imagine being an owner, and being late to a patient who had an extremely unpleasant experience with a previous provider. If I was the owner (doctor or not) I would be on time. She said their PA/NPs are on time-- just not their doctors. What?? Is the patient`s time not worth anything to them? I told her to just tell this doctor my husband needed to be on time for his job (ironic since this doctor never is to his own job), but the office manager said she couldn`t promise that he`d be on time...?? How can someone be purposely late to the first patient in the morning??   Well, come October 1st, office manager called my husband because the doctor said he no longer wanted to see him. Probably my fault because I mentioned insurance fraud for Hannah completely documenting an entire physical exam without touching my husband. Again, I`m a PA. YOU MUST ACTUALLY TOUCH A PATIENT TO PRACTICE GOOD MEDICINE. So, now I`m warning all you good folks about staying away from this incompetent, lazy, always running late pain group. Stay away."<5<10<2019<8<51<17

But service, that`s a completely different story. Been here about 3 times and have had not so great service every single time.  First time, made the mistake of coming during lunch time. Wait was about 45 minutes but luckily I had nothing planned after and was looking forward to trying a new place. After almost an hour we finally had a table. And after 30 minutes, finally got our food. It was very busy so I understand the wait. Second time, I called in my order since I only had 30 minutes for lunch. Said it would be ready in 20. Got there, still had to wait 20 minutes for my food. The order had not even been started yet. Third visit, came here today with my boss. Came around 1:30 after the lunch rush. They weren`t very busy but we felt like they were rushing us to get out. There wasn`t even anyone waiting for a table. So yeah, long story short...service is lacking. They have picked up on hiring extra staff which is good.  On the other hand, food is amazing!!!! The bulgogi burrito is my #1 choice. The mix of Korean and Mexican flavors all rolled into one is mind blowing!!! This is probably what unicorns eat since it`s super amazing. If you`re feeling like a health nut, they offer the same taste in a lettuce taco. Not really healthy if you eat 4 of them though. The portions are huge and the price is affordable! Since I`m close by, I will be back.<14<6<2013<5<36<19

I`ve visited all three of their locations on different occasions throughout the past couple of weeks, so I plan to leave a review on each of their yelp pages. I`m glad they have three different locations, it makes it so convenient when I`m at a different part of town. All their barbers are friendly and I`ve never had a bad experience!   The first time I came in with my son and husband, initially planning on just my son getting a haircut. We were greeted when we came in, and we were helped by a very friendly man who was very patient with my son. As a mom, that made me feel so at ease...especially at a barbershop because kids can be so impatient and my son usually cries. This time, though... there was no crying!! The barber has such a way with kids and my son was giggling! After he was done with his haircut and we saw the finished result, my husband wanted one too! Now, we are regulars at the three barber shops and I definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a new barber. These nice people will definitely take care of you!<10<12<2019<7<43<2

They also operate a small restaurant next door where you can buy curries by the oz starting from $4.99 (which is unbeatable price wise)  I have tried a lot of the items some of them are good while others are just okay The chicken tikka Masala was very mediocre.   One thing I will say is order ahead they are very slow and I have had to wait on numerous occasions even after placing my order well in advance Customer service is not great and I feel the store could be cleaner   They sell Indian pizzas which are quite delicious   Cheers!<27<11<2019<5<33<58

No one was inside except 3 vagrants. One sleeping in the corner booth, one eating chips from the gas station and one on his computer with his dirty duffle bags all around. I didn`t see one purchase from McDonald`s anywhere near them. Why do they allow this? I can see why no one was dining in there. Its scary going in there. I think I made my last visit there especially in the evening. This wasn`t the first time I witnessed this situation.<13<12<2019<5<33<37

We arrived so full of hope to this perfectly hipsterized little Indian spot. The service was friendly, the decor impeccable, and the menu very promising.   So we ordered some Indian classics, such as a thali and a street food dish called chaat and eagerly awaited for our feast.   This is where, unfortunately, the love story ends. The food was lacking spice and flavour. It was also very heavy on rice and fillers (chevda- classic Indian chip like snack), but very low on meat and veg dishes. Considering the prices are at least double of what you would pay on Jean-Talon, this was quite disappointing.   If you`re looking for a cute spot in the neighbourhood, this might do the trick, but if you`re craving good Indian, I wouldn`t recommend it.<9<6<2017<15<0<11

I gave it four because it was really really greasy and it somewhat grossed me out. Crazy? I was grossed out but it was delicious. So it must be good if the deliciousness over powered that part. Ha. We ate the '"Vampiro'", which is a fried up tortilla (basically a tostada shell) with carne asada. The asada was yummy and flavorful. We also had pastor tacos, those were so so yummy but again, the greasy is what got to me. I had an after taste in my mouth all night of canola oil. Next time I will dab all my food with a napkin or advise then to lay low the oil but overall I will most definitely be back. Great place, it`s really hidden.

The place has a really nice old country style inn feel and the staff are friendly.  There is always a line up and it always looks like it is worth the wait.  We waited for about 15 minutes for a table and our expectations were extremely high.  The portions and plates are HUGE so make sure you come here hungover and super super hungry to get your moneys worth.  I ordered they usual eggs, bacon, french toast, and home fries.  Everything looked okay until I realized that everything tasted like salt.  There was salt in everything and it was hard to eat.  The french toast was horrible and it tasted like bread dipped in a really bad egg.  The eggs tasted like powdered eggs and were extremely hard to eat.  Overall, I left flips disappointed and will not go back.  Maybe they were having an '"off'" day or maybe my expectations were too high.... regardless... Flips was an utter fail for food."<9<4<2014<5<5<23

I finally discovered Jean Philippe Patisserie in the Aria Resort and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip earlier last year and still think about all their delightful desserts.  This place is a mecca for your sweet tooth cravings. I`m very impressed with the delicate and intricate designed desserts behind the window display. Honestly, I have only tried their desserts at their Bellagio location but noticed this selection is at least double the inventory since the bakery is housed here.   My favorites at JPP is the truffles, macarons ($2.50) and their pistachio flavored rice krispy treat ($4.99). The pumpkin spiced macaron had a bright pumpkin flavor and the crisp outside to gooey inside ratio was perfect. The truffles hands down had to be one of the best. If you know someone who`s a huge chocolate fan, buy some truffles and instantly gain '"brownie'" points!  And it does not stop there... with a full cafe, gelato bar, crepe station and packaged gifts, this place offers an arrangement of sweet offerings. This will always be my primary choice because of: selection of pastries, the truffles and shorter lines.   They have several seats and tables for you to enjoy your plated desserts and beautifully decorated seasoned theme throughout the area. My interaction with the staff has been extremely friendly and I never felt rushed to make a decision.   You`ll definitely hit the jackpot at Aria`s Jean Philippe!"<10<1<2017<4<18<30

Never got any updates on if it was showing up on that date or another date. Today while sitting in my living room with the door open, something makes a loud noise at my front door. OnTrac Delivery service that they use threw the box 3 feet from the door. I jumped up so fast, but the person that brought it up did not even speak or ring the door bell, they just threw the box and walked away so dang fast. So fast I couldn`t see if it was a guy or a girl. After being thrown to the ground, Home Depot I sure hope the heating elements didn`t get hurt.

Came here on the last night of our trip in Scottsdale. Having eaten so many wonderful meals, we were seeking something casual and easy. This place hit the spot.   We arrived at 6:45 and to our surprise, there was a 15-20 min for a table on a Monday night. They don`t take reservations. So we grabbed a drink at the bar-me, a very good glass of Oregon Pinot Noir and for my husband, a seasonal draft IPA.   We were later seated in the main dining area near the fire place which was nice because it was unseasonably cold this evening. We shared the devil eggs and shrimp ceviche both of which were very tasty. I had the market fish special which was a blackened mahi mahi served with a side of broccolini seasoned with lemon and cotija-the side was a true standout, and the fish was fine-nice grill marks-a little overcooked for my liking. My husband opted for the very spicy and very yummy chicken enchilada special and it was a real highlight.   We didn`t order dessert but since it was my birthday, the friendly server packed us a key lime pie to go. We tasted it later and it was mediocre at best, but a super nice gesture.   In summary, service was a 4, and atmosphere is a 3.5 and food a 3-3.5. We would definitely return because we really liked this place. Not sure if it is quite as good as The Henry but it surely is a popular spot worth dining at.<10<12<2019<4<15<0

I`m definitely going to keep it on my list of coffee shops to visit to work remote. It`s the cutest place! I`m honestly obsessed now.  I met some ladies here for a work meeting and it was rather peaceful. Some coffee shops can be so noisy. But this place was really quiet in the best way possible. There were some other customers in there meeting as well. There`s plenty of places to sit and they have some lounge furniture as well, which makes it all the more that much more inviting.  I opted to try the Sin City, which is one of their custom drinks. I believe it was coffee, chocolate sauce, milk and caramel. They made it iced for me and put it in the cutest glass that made me feel like I was at a 50`s diner. It was soooo good! I didn`t finish it in time as I had to jet to another meeting, so I took the rest to go in a to-go cup.  The staff was kind and patient. I even missed when they called my name out for the drink, but one of the nice baristas brought it out to me instead, even though she really didn`t have to do it.  If you love coffee shops and are in the neighborhood, pay this place a visit and get the Sin City. You`re welcome in advance!<6<6<2019<15<1<53
